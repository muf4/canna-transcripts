1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
good afternoon thanks for attending my

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,609
talk I'd also like to thank the can med

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,080
organizers for inviting me here today

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:14,039
the background image on my title slide

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,870
is actually not related to the core of

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,640
the talk I thought you might like to see

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:20,189
it this is a fossilized cannabis leaf

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,679
dating to the Elysian era approximately

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,289
30 million years ago the title of my

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,089
talk is not classifying cannabis for

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,210
genetics but that's okay we're going to

12
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:30,480
get into that a little bit anyways

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,850
[Music]

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,770
the title is ethno botanical mix and

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,109
cannabis I'm going to focus on the

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,270
genomic consequences of economics and

17
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,649
law as forces of selection during

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,719
cannabis domestication ethno botanical

19
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:47,759
word that I made up

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,570
it's a portmanteau of ethnobotany which

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,030
is the study of plants and human

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:01:01,710
interactions and genomics which is the

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:03,570
study of genomes so no key resource and

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,629
genome research is of course a reference

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,250
genome and so I'll spend a little bit

26
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:10,829
time talking about the reference that I

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,569
assembled and released last year the

28
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,090
project design included deep sequencing

29
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,250
of three haplotypes and two components

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,500
first the marijuana by hemp cross and

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,849
the genome assembly and physical mapping

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,739
of CBD rx the genetic map was based on

33
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,839
the sequencing of a recombinant f2

34
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,199
population developed by George we blends

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,000
group at the University of Minnesota

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,790
first to near isogenic lines were

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,950
developed by inbreeding skunk number one

38
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,860
and Carmen for several generations to

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,770
make their genomes homozygous these were

40
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,688
crossed produce a hybrid f1 an f1 female

41
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:48,000
is hermaphrodite is in colloidal silver

42
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:50,219
and and self pollinated seeds from the

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,859
f1 grew into the recombinant f2

44
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:55,438
population tree sequence with whole

45
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,390
genome low coverage Illumina we also

46
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,459
measure important agronomic traits in

47
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,030
the f2 population such as cannabinoid

48
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,129
profiles and plant architecture in this

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,459
slide on the right I show the genotypes

50
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:13,560
which are indicated in rows of 96 of the

51
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:16,560
f2 s each of which is indicated

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:22,709
a column in that square on the right is

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:25,020
a chromosome where you see blue those

54
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,330
regions of the genome inherited from the

55
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,219
marijuana grandparent and yellow as

56
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,540
regions of the genome inherited from the

57
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:35,159
hemp grandparent green is heterozygous

58
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:40,409
regions of the genome and transitions in

59
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:46,829
color indicates where crossover events

60
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:48,870
happen during meiosis in the f1 so each

61
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,700
row again is unique segregation pattern

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,319
of genes and have to population which

63
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,449
you can correlate with the segregation

64
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,709
of traits to determine the regions of

65
00:02:54,449 --> 00:03:00,389
the genome contributing to those traits

66
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,519
the cord genome assembly was based on

67
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,768
the sequencing of a highly inbred line

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,560
from functional remedies called CBD rx

69
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,840
Todd Michel at the JC VI generated a

70
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,849
total of 100 x coverage of the CBD rx

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,819
genome with Oxford nanopore and Illumina

72
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:19,019
reads the Oxford nanopore minion is a

73
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:21,919
USB device about the stick of gum the

74
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,019
minion contains protein pores embedded

75
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,268
in a glass plate electrodes measure the

76
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,430
electrical resistance as DNA molecules

77
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,769
pass through the pore which is used to

78
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,140
model the DNA sequence the minion

79
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,629
generates the longest reads of any DNA

80
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,699
sequencing technology and long reads are

81
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,889
essential for assembling repeat rich

82
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,560
plant genomes but have a higher rate at

83
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,509
the nucleotide level so with some of the

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,219
long reads in the long context to get

85
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:49,409
the genome structure right and polished

86
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,329
the configs with highly accurate high

87
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:54,900
coverage Illumina data to perfect the

88
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,939
nucleotide sequence further satting with

89
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,650
a high C library from phaz genomics and

90
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,319
it ended up with a little less than

91
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,039
2,000 contexts that form the basis of

92
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,039
the physical map

93
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:08,310
so then I integrated the genetic and

94
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:10,438
physical maps to produce chromosome

95
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,810
scale pseudo molecules corresponding to

96
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,549
the 10 chromosomes of cannabis the

97
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,918
animation depicted in my slide shows

98
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,439
each chromosome in white with the genes

99
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,598
genetic position on the y axis shown in

100
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,089
centimorgans from the physical position

101
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:26,189
shown in mega base pairs on the x axis i

102
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:28,258
also show the recombination rate in red

103
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,969
is very important because it tells us

104
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,460
how tightly linked to positions in the

105
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,830
genome are which is very valuable for

106
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:37,168
designing breeding experiments involving

107
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:39,209
marker-assisted selection and for an

108
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:42,359
evolutionary inference in which I'll

109
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:44,098
most of the my talk will be on note the

110
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,650
extreme recombination suppression in the

111
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:48,509
centre of the chromosomes about 90% of

112
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:52,399
the genetic genetic recombination takes

113
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,400
place in about 10 percent of the genome

114
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,939
so the CBD rx genome was released late

115
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,639
last year and has proven a valuable

116
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:02,279
resource for the cannabis community one

117
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,090
of my favorite citations is this recent

118
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,948
preprint

119
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:06,750
that identified the sex chromosome as

120
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,129
chromosome one and their main figure

121
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,220
they share the expression of sex

122
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:12,329
specific genes and red and blue bars

123
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,070
there now several whole genomes

124
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:16,800
available for cannabis and we can use

125
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:18,478
them to cross validate each other on the

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,908
right is a figure that Kevin mckernon

127
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,560
presented yesterday in his talk to

128
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:24,598
synthetic blood of the Jamaican Lyon

129
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,728
Assembly against the CBD rx assembly

130
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:28,288
these diagonal lines indicate a high

131
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:31,649
level of agreement and validate the

132
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:33,629
structure of both so now I'm gonna

133
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:36,120
switch gears a little bit and put on my

134
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:37,949
evolutionary biologist hat I'd like to

135
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,590
review some key concepts so be helpful

136
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:42,689
for the rest of my talk at the center of

137
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:44,038
the slide is phenotype the composite of

138
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,658
an organism's traits and what I'm

139
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,000
guessing most of you are most interested

140
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:50,639
in plants phenotype is controlled in

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,699
large part by its genes definition of

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,348
evolution that I'm using today is change

143
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,348
in allele frequency over time

144
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:06,709
in an organism's interaction with its

145
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,509
environment is called the the niche the

146
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:11,269
ecological niche these interactions are

147
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:13,399
influenced a reproductive success to a

148
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:15,680
great degree and thus drive evolution at

149
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,329
the population level an ecological niche

150
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,100
includes its habitats such as

151
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:20,870
precipitation temperature day length

152
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,770
soil nutrients as well as interactions

153
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:27,050
with pollinators and predators now the

154
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:29,329
ecological needs of domesticated

155
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,310
organisms also includes his interaction

156
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,349
with human culture how it's used the

157
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,370
demand for its product how the product

158
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:39,290
is regulated here's a picture of some

159
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,720
wild cannabis drying in its native

160
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,730
habitat and Eurasian steppe this plant

161
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,190
is well adapted to a weedy life history

162
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,200
on this riverbank it doesn't look like a

163
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:49,879
particularly valuable crop it's short

164
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,670
and branching and makes small flowers

165
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,379
over the past few millennia humans have

166
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,379
selected for composite traits very

167
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:58,959
different from this and in the process

168
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:03,259
domesticated to very different crops

169
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:05,299
here's a picture of some fiber hemp it's

170
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:07,069
very tall doesn't branch much and can be

171
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,410
mechanically harvested with ease

172
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:12,339
most of the biomass is allocated to the

173
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,720
stems which the fibers are harvested

174
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,459
cannabinoids are typically undesirable

175
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,040
in fiber hemp and they gum up the

176
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:22,459
processing machines most hemp is not

177
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,040
very intoxicating so contrast this with

178
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:27,319
marijuana pictured here in general

179
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,510
marijuana is relatively short branches

180
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,849
more allocates a large proportion of

181
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,589
biomass those flowers the majority of

182
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,879
our precious cannabinoids are secreted

183
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:40,399
into glandular trichomes here's a

184
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,409
principal component analysis or PCA the

185
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,839
genetic data from about 300 individuals

186
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,700
from four different studies a PCA is a

187
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,289
statistical technique for compressing

188
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,060
millions of genetic variants down to a

189
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,950
few dimensions or principal components

190
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,709
that explain the most variance in the

191
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,389
data each individual is represented by a

192
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:58,579
single point in the plot and is colored

193
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,259
according to its functional class the

194
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:02,509
plot shows the top two principal

195
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:04,610
components you can conceptualize the y

196
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,310
axis is how far along the individual is

197
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,530
in the domestication process the x axis

198
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,240
corresponds to the primary principal

199
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:12,439
component and clearly separates

200
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,629
marijuana from

201
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,310
as humans selected for different

202
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:18,379
phenotypes to process and at different

203
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,629
products the populations of all

204
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:22,159
genetically the plot below is a more

205
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:24,589
granular view of each individual's

206
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,120
ancestry each column and the lower plot

207
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,979
is a stacked bar plot showing the

208
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,790
percent ancestry and its genome from

209
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,920
each of the three functional classes

210
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,330
here's another way to look at population

211
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,009
differentiation this is a population

212
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,420
branch statistic just based on how

213
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:40,580
similar allele frequencies and

214
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,409
populations are the longer the branch

215
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,629
the more differentiated the populations

216
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:48,319
are from each other notice the small

217
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:49,879
insect tree near the histogram this is

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,280
the genome-wide average of the

219
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,899
population statistic we know from the

220
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,309
previous slide that marijuana and hemp

221
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,439
are highly differentiated that is

222
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:59,479
reflected in the branch lengths the

223
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,370
large tree however is drawn in the same

224
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,870
scale as the small tree which shows the

225
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,060
population branch statistic at the

226
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,429
synthase locus it's an extreme outlier

227
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:09,529
and we look back at the histogram that

228
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:12,759
shows the distribution of branch lengths

229
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:16,250
in the marijuana line I've indicated the

230
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:21,139
99.9 fifth percentile and dotted line

231
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:25,149
and shown with an arrow where the

232
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:28,220
synthase locus lies in that distribution

233
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:31,370
what this tells me is that there's been

234
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,220
strong divergent selection for very

235
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,049
different phenotypes or alleles

236
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,660
producing those phenotypes at the

237
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:41,719
synthase locus we look at the land race

238
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:43,579
of the natural populations we actually

239
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,790
have a negative branch leg suggesting

240
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,220
that the locus evolves neutrally in the

241
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:52,429
wild is not under strong natural

242
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,490
selection so what about high CBD

243
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:57,169
cannabis high CBD cannabis plants

244
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,240
typically have mostly marijuana like

245
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:01,189
phenotypes the shorter more branching

246
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,710
the very large flowers and are high in

247
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,440
total cannabinoids however they're low

248
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:08,000
in THC and are non-intoxicating they

249
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,510
have a mosaic phenotype of both

250
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,850
marijuana like and hemp like traits how

251
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:15,919
did we get here this animation shows

252
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,899
changes in cannabis law in the United

253
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,419
States through time in the past five

254
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:22,759
years laws have been passed

255
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:24,589
progressively legalizing CBD as we all

256
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,319
know last year's farm bill legalized

257
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,540
hemp and

258
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,310
Beadie the law classifies HAMP is a

259
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:33,870
cannabis plant that produces less than

260
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:35,969
0.3 percent THC there's a bar plot

261
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,700
showing a steady increase in CBD sales

262
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,129
over time my core argument here is that

263
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,250
these two changes legalization of CBD

264
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:45,990
coupled with a steady increase in sales

265
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,990
opened up an unprecedented ecological

266
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:52,799
niche that is a new way for cannabis to

267
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,779
interact with human culture this is a

268
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,549
genome plot for the 10 CBD our X

269
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,230
chromosomes remember how I mentioned

270
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:59,639
that the genetic map could be used to

271
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,159
identify regions of the genome

272
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,389
responsible for functional traits from

273
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,259
this plot I show the low-side

phenotypes Louis I responsible for plant

277
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,169
architecture are indicated by green and

280
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,870
star that's I colored the komak

281
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,970

282
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,310
regions of the genome inherited from

283
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,590
marijuana ancestors are colored in blue

284
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:30,929
regions inherited from hemp ancestors

285
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,090
are colored in yellow we can see that

286
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:36,059
the CBD rx genome is about 90 percent

287
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,600
marijuana derived in about 10% hemp

288
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,869
derived

289
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,320
so just as high CBD plants have mosaic

290
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:47,100
phenotypes they also have mosaic genomes

291
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,020
mosaic patterns are the same here's a

292
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,389
graphical summary of the concept I just

293
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,710
discussed marijuana and hemp have long

294
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,110
been selected for very different

295
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,870
phenotypes and it diverged genetically

296
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,879
as indicated by the three colors the law

297
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,980
however is only concerned with percent

298
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,439
THC and the legal classification of

299
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,930
plants is indicated by the style of

300
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,580
shading the breeding history of high CBD

301
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,319
cannabis varieties involved the

302
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,600
introgression of hemp like synthase

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,509
light genomic background this is a

305
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:20,879
schematic of my mental model of

306
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:23,159
population dynamics in cannabis the

307
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,929
right hand side illustrates the

308
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,819
domestication process which we have

309
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:28,559
covered now I'm also interested in

310
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,020
global patterns of biogeography and

311
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,639
dispersal I'll conclude my talk today

312
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,509
with some preliminary analyses of

313
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,559
old-world biogeography I scraped some

314
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:40,389
genetic data provided by the now that

315
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,369
defiant cope and cannabis project and

316
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:44,799
clustered approximately 100 individuals

317
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,870
based on shared ancestry in this matrix

318
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,149
each row or column is a single

319
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,828
individual cells are colored according

320
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,899
to the proportion of shared ancestry

321
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:55,808
with yellow indicating low-level shared

322
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:58,870

323
00:12:55,808 --> 00:13:00,818
red and high in anchored blue and this

324
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,220
plot I intentionally emitted elite hemp

325
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:04,958
and marijuana cultivars in order to

326
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,540
highlight the differences between land

327
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,159
races the samples loosely close the

328
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:11,740
cluster into eighteen groups and show a

329
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:13,870
pattern of isolation by distance the

330
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,049
most differentiated clusters are those

331
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,709
of Central Africa and Central Europe

332
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:22,088
notice the tree at the top of the plot I

333
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:24,278
overlaid this tree from the previous

334
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:27,220
slide under Geographic map to get this

335
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:28,870
figure the red arrows show hypothesized

336
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,649
dispersal routes but which cannabis

337
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:35,379
expanded its range you can also map the

338
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:37,389
old world physical biogeography on a

339
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:39,308
physical map of the genome this

340
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:41,438
animation and colored genomic segments

341
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:43,269
according the predicted ancestry found

342
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:44,649
the elite hemp cultivar to be centered

343
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,629
primarily from the Slavic lands

344
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,370
essential in Eastern Europe well the

345
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,899
elite marijuana cultivar is descended

346
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,159
mostly from South Asia and the Middle

347
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:58,419
East that's it thanks for attending my

348
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:01,088
talk I'm at Harvard University most of

349
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:03,490
this was done as a consultant for

350
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:05,709
sunrise genetics the genetic mapping

351
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,209
population was developed at the

352
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:11,679
University of Minnesota by jorts we

353
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:13,739
blend Todd Michael at the JCB I produced

354
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,649
most of the course sequencing data

355
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:21,308
functional remedies of Colorado provided

356
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,178
some funding and the CBD rx and of

357
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,769
course none of this would have been

358
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:28,470
possible without that all these amazing

359
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:28,470
sequencing technologies so

360
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:48,669
well I'll take questions okay of the

361
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,620
curious looking at the range of

362
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:52,318
phenotypes you're covering there at the

363
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,789
genetics do you have any sense of

364
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:56,740
whether you feel like there's limits on

365
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:58,120
kind of extreme phenotypes that you can

366
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,959
get out of plants so that's something

367
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,149
neck table I don't think that there's a

368
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,248
limit on it if you look at like Maisie

369
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:10,028
olds over the past century it's been a

370
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:14,470
linear relationship between yield and

371
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:21,370
time so I think if we keep pushing it

372
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:24,278
the plants will respond thank you first

373
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:27,339
of all fascinating talk Thanks I'm

374
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:31,389
curious if if you could go sort of back

375
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:34,360
in time why what were sort of the

376
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:39,100
original selective pressures that you've

377
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:41,278
identified from that wild type that you

378
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,300
showed a picture of that was essentially

379
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,828
nothing that anybody would resemble

380
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:48,278
nothing that anybody would consider to

381
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:51,688
be a yeah so I mean cannabis sativa is

382
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:56,198
you know I consider it a single species

383
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:58,980
with a lot of diversity the native range

384
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:04,328
is probably like the Eurasian steppe and

385
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:06,730
so depending on the where the population

386
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:09,849
was located that would dictate kind of

387
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,639
what it was adapted to so we see extreme

388
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:17,019
variation and day length and

389
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:20,019
precipitation and actually you you know

390
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,959
all of this wild term plasm potentially

391
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:27,068
could be a great source for for breeding

392
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:29,428
if we can collect the seeds thank you

393
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,428
you're welcome

394
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:38,299
okay

395
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,278
