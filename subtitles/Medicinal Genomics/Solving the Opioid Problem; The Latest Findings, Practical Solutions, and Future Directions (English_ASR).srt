1
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,080
all right well thank you Deb for the

2
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:16,509
introduction and the opioid problem the

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,000
background which hopefully will set the

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,618
stage for a nice conversation and my

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,230
goal for this panel in this conversation

6
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:24,839
is to bring together people that are on

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,640
the front lines of clinical practice

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,939
people that are doing research both in

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,960
experimental settings and epidemiologic

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:37,050
research and to inform each other how to

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,460
best move forward to solve this problem

12
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:41,919
that's in all of our faces and that's

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,320
touching all of our lives either

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,929
directly or indirectly the opioid

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,409

often we can have a conversation that's

85
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:39,878
all science and not know how to ground

86
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,650
that in reality and real change that

87
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:45,429
affects people and saves people's lives

88
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:47,739
so thank you all for being here I'm glad

89
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,620
to bring this diverse panel together and

90
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,139
I'm curious to start with you Julia if I

91
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,299
may because you have a long career in

92
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:58,000
academic medicine and clinical practice

93
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,219
and I'm curious about your patient

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,949
population and what your experience has

95
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:05,169
been like starting to see the use of

96
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:08,229
cannabis in your clinic okay thank you

97
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:10,509
so much yeah like Dustin said I've been

98
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:15,669
in academic medicine for a couple of

99
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:17,769
decades and prior to 2014 when medical

100
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,680
cannabis was legalized in New York State

101
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,228
where I live my academic and research

102
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,579
and clinical career was largely focused

103
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:28,870
on patients with opioid use disorder

104
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:31,028
specifically how to help those patients

105
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,889
to better adhere to medical treatments

106
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:36,339
for chronic diseases like

107
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:38,019
HIV and hepatitis C and a whole host of

108
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:40,598
other chronic diseases that people who

109
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:43,658
survived opioid use disorder go on to to

110
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:46,478
get a couple things that I noticed about

111
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:48,639
cannabis during the years that I was

112
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,430
focused on opioid use disorder were

113
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,340
these we did a number of studies where

114
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,468
we looked at how patients with opioid

115
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:59,079
use disorder who used other drugs like

116
00:04:56,468 --> 00:05:01,990
cocaine or benzodiazepines or alcohol or

117
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:04,748
cannabis how those other drugs affected

118
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,460
their ability to adhere to complex

119
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:09,490
medical therapies for conditions like

120
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:12,538
HIV and the one drug of all of those

121
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,968
that I named that did not seem to impair

122
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:17,889
adherence to other medical therapies was

123
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:21,360
cannabis so we looked at each of those

124
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:23,650
drugs and found that cocaine alcohol

125
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,319
benzodiazepines all led to worse

126
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:28,088
adherence coupled with opioids and that

127
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,348
cannabis didn't have that deleterious

128
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:32,019
effect so that was an interesting

129
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:35,248
observation the other thing that I

130
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:39,338
noticed more in a clinical sense is that

131
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:43,120
patients who were using cannabis to

132
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:45,250
treat chronic pain chronic pain from

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,620
conditions like sickle-cell disease or

134
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,689
radiculopathy osteoarthritis

135
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,519
inflammatory arthritis those patients

136
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:53,949
seemed to and I don't have data to

137
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,560
support this but seem to be less likely

138
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:58,509
to go on to develop opioid use disorder

139
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,490
so those were two observations that were

140
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,830
kind of floating around in my head and

141
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,449
then this big thing happened in New York

142
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,818
State which is that medical cannabis was

143
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:10,408
made legal in 2014 we were the 30th

144
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:12,759
state and so I and my research group

145
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:15,639
thought this was a great opportunity to

146
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,009
both expand practice and also to expand

147
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,860
our research focus and so we were able

148
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,620
to put together a medical cannabis

149
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,919
practice within our safety net academic

150
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,449
Medical Center Hospital and our hospital

151
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:30,899
is in the Bronx New York you may be

152
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:35,228
familiar with it anybody from the Bronx

153
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:36,939
no okay

154
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:40,000
so the Bronx is one of the nation's

155
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:41,800
poorest congressional districts nearly

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,949
90 percent of the patients in our

157
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,670
Hospital are insured by Medicaid with or

158
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:49,670
without Medicare

159
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:52,400
people are the the rates of opioid

160
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,949
overdose deaths and opioid use disorder

161
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,959
alcohol use are extraordinarily high and

162
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,560
have been for decades the current focus

163
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,060
on the opioid epidemic is not new to us

164
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,030
we've been focused on it for a long time

165
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:09,290
and so we saw this as an opportunity to

166
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:12,409
try to help patients who could not

167
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,569
afford to go to a private doctor to have

168
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,610
an evaluation for medical cannabis to be

169
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,199
able to be evaluated and to obtain

170
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,389
medical cannabis and so we began this

171
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,539
practice about a year and a half ago and

172
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,339
we've seen about 500 patients and the

173
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,020
patient's just to get a flavor of what

174
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:29,659
it's like where we practice the patients

175
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:33,439
are overwhelmingly african-american or

176
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,120
Latino or latina only about 15% white as

177
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,790
I said most of them have Medicaid or

178
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,500
Medicare and they have their older for

179
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,050
the most part and they have a huge host

180
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,089
of chronic medical conditions a quarter

181
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,030
have diabetes almost half have asthma

182
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,889
almost half have hypertension 40% have

183
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:51,439
depression that the medical

184
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:53,839
comorbidities are very high and the

185
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,730
demand to see us for medical cannabis is

186
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,399
extraordinary we can't keep up with the

187
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,620
demand we have waiting lists you know

188
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,939
that are months out so what we've done

189
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,590
so far is we've looked at this

190
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,959
population of patients that we've seen

191
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:08,209
and said or what happens to them after

192
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,509
they come to see us and it turns out

193
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:13,399
that only half of them are able to go to

194
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:14,810
the dispensary and purchase medical

195
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,429
cannabis the other half are unable to

196
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,589
purchase it and so we've called those

197
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,670
patients and asked them how come you

198
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,959
weren't able to purchase medical

199
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,420
cannabis and what they said was that

200
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,339
they couldn't afford it and so this is

201
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,259
this is a heartbreaking situation when I

202
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,299
tell patients in practice this is what

203
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,009
it's going to cost you people outright

204
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,629
break out in tears you know when they're

205
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,419
sitting and talking to me so that's a

206
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:37,939
tremendous tremendous barrier is the

207
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,129
cost and it's really a huge social

208
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,780
justice issue so if there's anything

209
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:44,689
that I would like to say to this group

210
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,370
it's to think about this as a social

211
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,290
justice issue and a health equity issue

212
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,389
for patients like the ones that I'm

213
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:52,250
seeing I think I'll thank you Julia I

214
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:53,759
have a question with a follow up

215
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,080
question thank you

216
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,870
I really appreciate you bringing

217
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,850
attention to the social justice part of

218
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,490
this and I think that the potential for

219
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,500
home cultivation and cottage industry in

220
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,019
states that adopt medical cannabis laws

221
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,299
is really crucial not to the exclusion

222
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,129
of a more standardized dispensary or

223
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,899
pharmaceutical model but I'm curious

224
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:14,070
about the results that you're seeing in

225
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,539
the half of your patients that are

226
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,650
accessing cannabis what's been

227
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,849
surprising for you so so of the half

228
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,370
that have been able to go to the

229
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,710
dispensary what we've further found is

230
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,360
that only about half of those are able

231
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,710
to continue with it so they'll come up

232
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,950
with the money and they'll and they'll

233
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:34,170
get it one time and then they're really

234
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,450
unable to sustain you know the continued

235
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:38,789
investment so what we do see is that

236
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,800
those who sustain you know the people

237
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:44,029
who continue to take it are the people

238
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:47,849
for whom is helpful but that's not data

239
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:52,259
sure okay all right well let me turn to

240
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:54,629
you Ziva so as clinicians in in the

241
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,490
practice of helping people with chronic

242
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:59,039
pain and opioids you know we're often

243
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,560
looking to the preclinical literature

244
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,240
that can maybe help inform what we're

245
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,000
doing and occasionally we have the

246
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,440
benefit of seeing some human

247
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,269
experimental data that really solidifies

248
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,710
what the animal studies are showing us

249
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:12,389
so I'm wondering if you could summarize

250
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,910
the important findings from your

251
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:17,279
excellent recent paper and some of the

252
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:18,719
implications thank you so much for that

253
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,629
lovely introduction and it's really

254
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,000
wonderful to be here and Dustin I think

255
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:28,799
that you summed up what my primary

256
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,419
interest is as a pharmacologist I first

257
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,209
started off doing my research in the

258
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:36,240
preclinical laboratory using mice and

259
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:39,540
rats and looking at opioid analgesic as

260
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,600
well as abuse liability and then I moved

261
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:44,490
to look at cannabis and cannabinoids in

262
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,759
the clinical laboratory about 10 years

263
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,799
ago

264
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,990
again looking at cannabis and

265
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,359
cannabinoids for pain relief okay this

266
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,399
is obviously a topic that's that's been

267
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,409
well covered over the course of the two

268
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,909
days and what's interesting about this

269
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:58,949
particular topic when we're thinking

270
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:00,719
about the potential opioid sparing

271
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:04,170
effects of cannabis and cannabinoids

272
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,149
that is can cannabis actually be a

273
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:07,649
substitute for opioids for pain relief

274
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,869
or

275
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,610
can it help to reduce the dose of opioid

276
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:14,399
needed to achieve pain relief and

277
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,800
therefore decrease the adverse effects

278
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,909
of opioids right you think lower dose of

279
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,588
opioids decrease adverse effects so at

280
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:25,948
the time when I was designing the study

281
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:27,779
I was really pulling on this very strong

282
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:30,719
preclinical literature that has only

283
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:33,688
grown over time and now we see in mice

284
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,110
rats and non-human primates that when

285
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:40,649
you combine a dose of a cb1 receptor

286
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:43,558
agonist like THC in fact THC that isn't

287
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,938
usually pain relieving with a very low

288
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:46,649
dose of an opioid that is in pain

289
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:49,049
relieving and you put them together you

290
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:51,659
see robust synergy so you see this

291
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:54,899
profound pain relieving effect but you

292
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:56,308
don't see a increase in the adverse

293
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,379
effects that are associated with the

294
00:11:56,308 --> 00:12:00,208
opioids so this these are very

295
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,550
encouraging findings in the preclinical

296
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:04,109
literature at the same time what was

297
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:06,269
happening when I was doing these studies

298
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,360
in the human laboratory to replicate

299
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,278
what we see in rats and mice there was

300
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,499
an explosion of research demonstrating

301
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,230
that in medical cannabis States there

302
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:18,870
are reduced opioid fatalities there are

303
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,670
reduced prescriptions of certain opioids

304
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,308
right and so there's state-level

305
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:26,028
evidence in addition to the anecdotal

306
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:28,649
evidence that we're hearing today that

307
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:31,289
cannabis can actually help to drive down

308
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,909
the use of opioids and so what I set out

309
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:34,828
to do was do a double-blind

310
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:37,049
placebo-controlled study where I

311
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:40,588
couldn't combined cannabis smoked

312
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:42,508
cannabis with a very small dose of an

313
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,449
opioid to see if we can see the synergy

314
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:47,759
when you can combine the two do you get

315
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:50,998
profound pain relief without a

316
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:55,019
potentiation of the adverse effects so

317
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:57,689
it's it's unique I think because it's a

318
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,669
very controlled setting it's not using a

319
00:12:57,688 --> 00:13:02,818
pain population I look at a pain

320
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:06,240
response to a painful stimulus that I am

321
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:08,368
exposing patients to and hopefully these

322
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,499
findings will generalize how large or

323
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:13,170
clinical populations of chronic pain

324
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:15,089
patients something that I think that the

325
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:17,639
folks at Einstein are working on today

326
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:18,629
but this type of model where you use a

327
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,620
controlled double-blind

328
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:24,840
placebo-controlled setting you can look

329
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,919
different types of cannabinoids and you

330
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,379
can look at different modes of

331
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,659
administration smoked obviously has

332
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,830
limited clinical therapeutic effects and

333
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,799
so we're starting a study looking at

334
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:37,170
vaporized cannabis with THC and

335
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,000
cannabidiol and the two together to see

336
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:41,879
if we can see that same opioids bearing

337
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,070
properties great I have a follow-up

338
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,679
question for you Ziva and I really

339
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,840
appreciate your critical thinking I know

340
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,829
that you approach this issue critically

341
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,830
and one of the problems with one of the

342
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,440
causes I should say the opioid problem

343
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:00,629
were claims made by the pharmaceutical

344
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,610
industry of great safety and great

345
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:04,799
efficacy and a lot of misinformation

346
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,710
perhaps we could even call it propaganda

347
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,539
directed at the medical community and so

348
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,940
I really want to avoid repeating that

349
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,230
mistake with cannabis right because it

350
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,630
can do some things and there's some

351
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,519
things that it might not do so without

352
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:19,799
all that background I'm curious Eva if

353
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,870
you could tell not only the scientific

354
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,079
community but also policy makers

355
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,810
anything about cannabis and opioids what

356
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,850
would it be any well the first thing is

357
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:32,159
that it definitely appears that cannabis

358
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:36,240
and cannabinoids have a great deal of

359
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:38,309
potential promise to help reduce the

360
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,169
opioid burden okay whether it's a

361
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:42,899
substitute or as an adjunct to opioids

362
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:45,990
but it is imperative on us as a

363
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,600
community where we care for patients and

364
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,419
guide scientific research that we have

365
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,590
to be as objective as possible and

366
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,169
understand that when we're looking at

367
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:57,480
cannabis it is a medication it is a

368
00:14:55,169 --> 00:15:01,079
medicine and we should be looking both

369
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,029
at the positive effects and this is very

370
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,400
important but in order for it to gain

371
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:07,620
legitimacy we have to be able to

372
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,600
demonstrate that the adverse effects are

373
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,340
minimal and we've already gone through

374
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,440
this this morning we know the adverse

375
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,389
effects are minimal but as we saw with

376
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,610
Emma dialect studies when you combine

377
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,549
cannabidiol with other therapeutics it

378
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,740
affects metabolism of commonly and

379
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:24,469
prescribed therapies and so this is one

380
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,909
area that we do need some rigorous

381
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,250
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic

382
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:31,049
research and it's really important when

383
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,289
i come to these meetings and i hear

384
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:35,139
about patient experiences and you know i

385
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:37,149
hear about

386
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,350
ei and I hear about cannabidiol and I

387
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:40,688
hear about the range of other

388
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,970
cannabinoids that you pioneers are using

389
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:44,618
right now that is very helpful for me as

390
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,230
a researcher who wants to do the

391
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:52,239
rigorous placebo studies to demonstrate

392
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,499
that these effects can be replicated and

393
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:55,829
to demonstrate the clinical

394
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:59,769
effectiveness to hopefully help guide

395
00:15:55,828 --> 00:16:01,599
patient care thank you and then back to

396
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:04,209
you Julia just for a quick follow-up

397
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,739
since Eva brought up the epidemiologic

398
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,479
associations and I know you've been an

399
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:09,278
author on several of those papers could

400
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,859
you offer our audience a quick summary

401
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:15,659
on what we're seeing in populations that

402
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:15,660
have meta access to medical cannabis

403
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:30,789
right so well I know I think the the

404
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:32,738
literature on on patients with access to

405
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:35,379
medical cannabis for the most part comes

406
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:37,629
from patients that have access to

407
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:39,220
medical cannabis and so there's a lot of

408
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:41,409
papers that have been published that are

409
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,379
surveys or even longitudinal studies

410
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:45,278
cohort studies of patients who have been

411
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,499
getting medical cannabis for medical

412
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,688
cannabis dispensaries and those patients

413
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:51,989
are demonstrating benefit great benefit

414
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:54,519
they have reductions in pain they have

415
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:56,199
they have reduced use of opioid

416
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:57,999
medications they have reduced use of

417
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,409
benzodiazepine medications they have

418
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:01,540
reduced use of over-the-counter

419
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:04,209
medications for pain and this has been

420
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:05,980
shown in a whole lot of surveys and also

421
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,720
in a number of kind of what we think of

422
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,429
as ecological studies so studies that

423
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,009
are derived from state-level databases

424
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:14,980
of all prescriptions written that were

425
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:18,148
paid for by Medicaid or Medicare and so

426
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,068
we've seen that what we haven't seen is

427
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:22,208
who needs access to medical cannabis you

428
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:24,188
know what's happened to them like the

429
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,480
patients that we're seeing who would who

430
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,399
we would like to have on medical

431
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,829
cannabis but are unable to be on it and

432
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:31,719
so we really have kind of a it's it's a

433
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:33,970
it's a bias in the in the data that

434
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,769
we've collected it's great data but it

435
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,000
tells one part of the story it tells a

436
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:39,339
story about people who are going to

437
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,720
dispensaries and are continuing to take

438
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:43,209
medical cannabis and are having

439
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,909
tremendous impact from it I agree what

440
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,319
we need to have are our randomized

441
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:48,010
controlled trials to demonstrate

442
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:51,039
efficacy

443
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:53,200
and and that becomes harder and harder

444
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,329
to do the more that products are

445
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,039
available to people in a variety of ways

446
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:58,389
so it's really a difficult balance that

447
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,798
we're trying to strike between making

448
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,080
products available to people because

449
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,960
people shouldn't live in pain people

450
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,909
should have access to to cannabis as

451
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,370
medicine but at the same time we want to

452
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:13,090
establish the efficacy and the evidence

453
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:15,089
base for cannabis in specific conditions

454
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:17,139
you know what might be the best

455
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:20,259
combination of cannabinoids and

456
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,820
terpenoids ofor radiculopathy for

457
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:24,429
inflammatory arthritis how are we going

458
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:27,298
to know that if we're not able to enroll

459
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:29,650
people in trials and conduct a rigorous

460
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:32,829
double-blind placebo-controlled trial

461
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:35,919
great thank you so much and so the next

462
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:37,539
one is for Caroline in my clinic I work

463
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,270
with about eight other doctors and nurse

464
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:42,879
practitioners and we're often standing

465
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:44,650
around at the end of the day still eight

466
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,450
years nine years after I've opened the

467
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,970
practice we're still amazed by what we

468
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,860
see especially when it comes to the

469
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,480
sparing effect of cannabis on other

470
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:54,819
drugs especially opioids and

471
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,798
benzodiazepines I'm wondering Caroline

472
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:58,629
if you could paint the picture of what

473
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,639
you're seeing now working with cannabis

474
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,160
and maybe how that contrasts to before

475
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,990
you started working with Pam cannabis in

476
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,820
the treatment of pain patients and you

477
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,890
can cover successes and failures

478
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:10,450
okay great thank you Dustin and it's

479
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,450
such a pleasure to be here with such a

480
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,100
great panel so I did work in four

481
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,019
different pain clinics and I did some

482
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:19,089
addiction before I moved into working

483
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:21,970
with cannabis it took me a little bit of

484
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:23,769
convincing by my patients but certainly

485
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,808
I did see a lot of side effects with

486
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:30,269
opioids and other medications that we

487
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:30,269
commonly use for chronic pain such as

488
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,160
anti-inflammatories antidepressants I

489
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,529
try to think about there so tricyclics

490
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,808
and gabapentin OIG's and certainly

491
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:42,849
patients actually found that they were

492
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:46,200
less functional and sometimes they

493
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:49,928
wanted to be in pain instead of have the

494
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,390
pain manage but be foggier so what I

495
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,880
find when I use cannabis with opioids is

496
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,630
that patients find that they need less

497
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,210
opioids

498
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,290
so Dustin and I will frequently comment

499
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,079
on in

500
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:06,009
the therapeutic index so cannabis makes

501
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,960
opioid safer and patients naturally tend

502
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,750
to reduce their dose on their own which

503
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,610
was really surprising because I've

504
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,009
worked including clinics where we've

505
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:17,889
tried to reduce opioid tippers very

506
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:20,920
slowly and it's very challenging even a

507
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:23,410
10% reduction or a 5% reduction a week

508
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,080
can be very painful and the withdrawal

509
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,910
can be really quite horrible so when

510
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:31,029
patients are in withdrawal that can look

511
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:35,170
like sweating they can be nauseous

512
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:37,569
irritability insomnia they can just have

513
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:39,789
so many side effects and what I find is

514
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:42,849
when I use cannabis with opioids

515
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:44,769
patients actually find that the I don't

516
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:46,959
want to see easily come off their

517
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:49,029
opioids but it's actually something they

518
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,579
do on their own before I even see them

519
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:53,859
and follow up I try to encourage them to

520
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:56,139
come back to me so we can organize a

521
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:58,359
teper together so that they feel

522
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,090
supported because education is so

523
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:03,369
important to understand what withdrawal

524
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:06,309
could look like but they're already

525
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:10,179
starting to do this on their own without

526
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:12,069
my help which can be good and bad but I

527
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,170
think that that's really a very clear

528
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:16,990
signal that there's something quite

529
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:19,720
special about that combination and when

530
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:22,809
patients come off opioids they actually

531
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,670
say to me you're right that wasn't

532
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:27,369
really helping me function any better

533
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:29,200
and initially they thought opioids were

534
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,479
helping but unfortunately over time

535
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,580
their dose has just kept increased in an

536
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,950
increasing without a lot of more

537
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:38,619
improvement unfortunately and just more

538
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,960
side effect so certainly this is

539
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:42,750
something I'm so passionate about I was

540
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,819
a pharmacist before I did medicine and

541
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:48,609
I'm now undoing all these medications

542
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:51,309
and and working on drug holidays which

543
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:53,379
is almost the opposite of what I used to

544
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:55,539
do so I feel I've really come full

545
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,580
circle and cannabis has been such a a

546
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,710
teacher in that way I just want to chime

547
00:21:57,579 --> 00:22:01,449
in for a minute there so I observed the

548
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,759
same thing when I started practicing as

549
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,140
patients coming back and telling me that

550
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,240
they started breaking their opioid

551
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,280
tablets in half because they were too

552
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,809
strong they simply felt too strong when

553
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,299
they took them together with the

554
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,789
cannabis now correct me if I'm

555
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,829
but I think in your paper when you ask

556
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:19,049
people about likability in the six

557
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:20,699
different conditions they preferred the

558
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:23,129
two and a half milligrams of oxycodone

559
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,660
plus cannabis to the five milligrams

560
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,670
that actually was more likeable that

561
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,850
lower dose of oxycodone is that right

562
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:31,500
right right so uh so with Dustin is

563
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,939
alluding to is one of the things that I

564
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,740
look at in addition to the pain

565
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,690
relieving effects of the combination of

566
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,269
cannabis and opioids is also abuse

567
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,370
liability so the idea is that if you are

568
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:43,170
increasing the pain relieving effects of

569
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:44,939
the opioid you want to make sure that

570
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:48,240
you're not increasing abuse liability

571
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,870
right and so what we found and it's

572
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,890
preliminary data is we found small

573
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:57,719
modest increases in subjective responses

574
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:00,300
related to this small dose of an opioid

575
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,920
that doesn't normally produce a good

576
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:03,869
effect on its own but when you combine

577
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,970
it with cannabis you do see some

578
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:08,489
increase in good effect but it's modest

579
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:11,009
okay but it's an important point to

580
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,450
raise yeah so so patients do often do

581
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:14,970
this on and their own and now there's

582
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,340
some data to back it up so I want to go

583
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,259
back to you Caroline because we often

584
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:21,779
see these incredible results and we tend

585
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,519
to focus on them I'm curious if you can

586
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:25,200
paint a picture of some of the patients

587
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,089
that are using opioids where you add

588
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,559
cannabis that maybe don't get these

589
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:30,720
impressive results what are those

590
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,200
challenges and how are you addressing

591
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,900
them I'm trying to think how many I have

592
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,700
that haven't had improvement but you're

593
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,600
right it's not for everyone

594
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,580
I think I have a biased population in

595
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,859
the sense that when they're coming to

596
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:48,569
seek help and I know Dustin we've talked

597
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:52,559
about this before they're very motivated

598
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:54,059
so certainly they really want to reduce

599
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,409
their opioids it's usually the first

600
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,690
words out of their mouth when they come

601
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:00,060
and see me is one of my goals is to come

602
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,039
down on my opioids so if I have patients

603
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:04,169
that are very motivated to begin with

604
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,450
their high functioning I definitely find

605
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:09,210
that that certainly helps reduce their

606
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,420
doses but even in those I'm trying to

607
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,309
think that haven't reduced their their

608
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:17,340
opioid doses certainly the opioid doses

609
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:21,450
have not escalated so they've see the

610
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:23,269
same and I feel that they have the side

611
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,930
effects the opioids may have also been

612
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:27,230
helped

613
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm trying to think if there's any other

614
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,620
was it I'll chime in for a moment this

615
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,319
is something that I think about a lot

616
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:36,959
because private practices that focus on

617
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,210
cannabis medicine so often do have this

618
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,710
selection bias where patients are coming

619
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,940
and motivated and I suspect that's a

620
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,269
little different than your practice

621
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,549
Julia you know basic principle in many

622
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:50,039
healing arts is the need for an exchange

623
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:51,569
for giving something in order to receive

624
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,309
something and a lot of your patients are

625
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:56,309
probably paying almost nothing for your

626
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:59,009
services and and so I I'm curious about

627
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:01,579
their level of motivation and also maybe

628
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:04,049
you can speak to this Caroline the

629
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:06,779
difference between a chronic pain

630
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:09,119
population and a more opiate addiction

631
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:11,069
or problematic use population of course

632
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,719
there's broad overlaps there but before

633
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:14,819
I let you answer this I just want to

634
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,160
point out to the audience that there's

635
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:19,889
been one paper and another abstract

636
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,440
published in the last six months that

637
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,300
looked at self-efficacy which i think is

638
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,880
partially what we're talking about here

639
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:28,769
when people have this can-do attitude

640
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,570
and they feel like they want to use

641
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,490
cannabis as a tool to improve themselves

642
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:34,829
and they're willing to participate in

643
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,019
their own self-improvement it looks from

644
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:38,970
this early observational data like

645
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:41,250
they're more likely to be successful in

646
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,980
using cannabis to do so versus those

647
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,450
with low self-efficacy now there's we

648
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,620
have to take care of everyone right the

649
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,230
people that have high and low

650
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:52,109
self-efficacy and I suspect that I'm

651
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,390
addressing that deficit may be a real

652
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:55,889
key component to getting better results

653
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,870
with some of these challenging patients

654
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,330
so at first Caroline if you could

655
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:02,009
comment on pain addiction problematic

656
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:05,069
use to overlap there and any

657
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:08,730
distinctions you're seeing yeah so I

658
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:12,179
think getting back to good clinical

659
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,910
practice and hence the reason Ethan and

660
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:17,880
I put together the paper that we did on

661
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:21,300
how to use medical cannabis and how to

662
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:25,200
dose appropriately I think that if you

663
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:28,500
use the right combinations of chemo VARs

664
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,440
if you're using doses that we we feel

665
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,859
are helpful and Dustin's a big proponent

666
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,480
of low dose uses of cannabis I think

667
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,189
that that's where we can see a lot of

668
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,589
benefit without seeing

669
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,750
side effects I do have patients that

670
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:46,199
come to me that made on a history of

671
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:48,450
addiction and they may be using higher

672
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,028
doses of THC than I would typically be

673
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:54,808
using so there's a lot of times we need

674
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:56,609
to educate on that you can get better

675
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:59,548
results with less which is very hard to

676
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:02,178
initially convince them of but a lot of

677
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:04,648
the times they have not been using CBD

678
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:07,590
when you're buying it on the street and

679
00:27:04,648 --> 00:27:10,319
recreationally high concentrates tabs

680
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:12,689
and other various routes can frequently

681
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,418
be used and I don't personally find them

682
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,548
to be as medically beneficial so we do

683
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:20,220
encourage them to transition to oils

684
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:23,009
which are going to last longer maybe up

685
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:26,788
to six hours at a time using a nice

686
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:30,389
balance of extra CBD or more CBD than

687
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:32,490
THC and to really focus on not chasing

688
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:35,490
their symptoms but preventing their

689
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:38,099
symptoms so looking at the idea of like

690
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:40,259
long-acting and then using short-acting

691
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:43,259
medications where needed so I think

692
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:45,240
there's a bit of Education there and a

693
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:47,610
lot of these patients with a history of

694
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,679
maybe some addiction undertone are

695
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:53,758
really looking for instant gratification

696
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:56,429
and we do offer some groups in in my

697
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,159
clinic so we we offer a yoga group some

698
00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:01,169
mindfulness meditation a lot of this is

699
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,299
self-awareness as dustin's mentioned

700
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:05,788
because a lot of these patients really

701
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:09,000
need to check in and question why

702
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:11,519
they're vaporizing or using cannabis

703
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,558
every hour every two hours and maybe

704
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,169
that there's underlining anxiety that

705
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:18,509
can be managed in another way so I feel

706
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:20,399
that we really need to use multiple

707
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:22,950
modalities and I always say that

708
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,500
cannabis is a great tool but it's it's

709
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:28,620
really not gonna do everything for

710
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,960
patients and discussing expectations is

711
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:33,388
really important I always recommend that

712
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,970
patients Journal and I know Dustin does

713
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:38,369
the same that journaling and really

714
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:41,038
seeing what dose is that sweet spot is

715
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:44,788
very important and sometimes we need to

716
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:48,179
change up maybe its CBD a or THC a and

717
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:50,368
it's not necessarily CBD and THC that

718
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,879
may work for somebody else so there is

719
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:54,939
an individual ization that

720
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:56,888
to happen and I guess something I'm I'm

721
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:00,190
pretty passionate about we've already

722
00:28:56,888 --> 00:29:03,758
talked about opioid reduction is I'm

723
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:06,159
working to create a tool to see how can

724
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:09,548
we better use cannabis even just as an

725
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:13,239
adjuvant to start and what what's a

726
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:15,219
worrisome dose of opioid in in the sense

727
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:18,219
of what would be a good patient to start

728
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:20,048
cannabis on especially for physicians I

729
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:23,288
think that are not convinced that

730
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:25,538
cannabis they're just unsure of it I

731
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:27,308
think that if you've got a patient on 50

732
00:29:25,538 --> 00:29:30,098
milligrams of morphine morphine

733
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:31,838
equivalent doses where we know there's

734
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:32,499
significant increase in morbidity and

735
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:34,958
mortality

736
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:37,058
that's a dose where we absolutely should

737
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:39,459
be considering cannabis before going to

738
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:42,878
a higher dose of opioids so just trying

739
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:45,818
to get some physicians feet wet that may

740
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:48,638
not otherwise be open to cannabis when

741
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:51,908
we've got patients that at that point

742
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:54,908
their risk of mortality is is huge and

743
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:56,859
in the u.s. last year more than 42,000

744
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:58,449
people died of opioids

745
00:29:56,858 --> 00:30:00,428
I think there's been more than a

746
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:04,509
trillion dollars spent on the opioid

747
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:06,849
crisis from 2001 to 2007 teen so

748
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:09,548
certainly that's really where I'm trying

749
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:12,068
to focus these days so that's your

750
00:30:09,548 --> 00:30:14,138
message for your colleagues in medicine

751
00:30:12,068 --> 00:30:15,878
what about for policy makers if you had

752
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:17,948
a room full of people that were making

753
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:19,808
and passing laws and you had their ear

754
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:22,778
for one or two minutes what would you

755
00:30:19,808 --> 00:30:24,908
want them to know so I think we've

756
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:26,828
touched on a lot of the high-level

757
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:29,469
concepts that cannabis is safer than

758
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:32,408
opioids in terms of therapeutic when

759
00:30:29,469 --> 00:30:34,359
window it's one to a thousand instead of

760
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:36,699
one to five or one to twenty that we see

761
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:40,118
with some of the opioids that cannabis

762
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:43,690
makes opioids safer cannabis can help

763
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:46,118
reduce opioid doses and I think for me

764
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,759
right now being in Vancouver in Canada

765
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:55,269
we've just legalized cannabis on October

766
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:57,009
17th but but unfortunately our medical

767
00:30:55,269 --> 00:31:00,278
bodies the Canadian Medical Association

768
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:03,848
has really not been supportive of

769
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:05,089
medical cannabis they actually see that

770
00:31:03,848 --> 00:31:08,839
medical and recreational

771
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:10,459
they feel can merge together so we

772
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:13,189
really have the next five years where

773
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,259
Health Canada is really looking to see

774
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,930
the difference of how somebody can use

775
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:19,879
this as a medicine versus just using it

776
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:24,080
recreational recreationally

777
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,360
so that's a huge concern for me because

778
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,519
my patients are very complicated they're

779
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,740
on a lot of medications they have a lot

780
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,480
of problems they can experience a lot of

781
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,359
side effects and some of these

782
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,539
populations are quite vulnerable so I

783
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:41,269
really want to to show that this isn't

784
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:43,129
something that's I mean patients do use

785
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:45,650
it on their own and do get benefit but

786
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:49,070
certainly if we can fine-tune it and and

787
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,690
make it a medical more medicalised i

788
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:53,899
guess that i think that that's really

789
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:56,840
where we should be focusing thank you

790
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,759
I'll open it to Julia or Ziva anything

791
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:03,069
to add if we were speaking to a roomful

792
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:03,069
of policy makers and those in charge I

793
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:10,190
mean I think that you know the the the

794
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,930
inconsistency with the way in which

795
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,640
cannabis is regulated in the United

796
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,769
States from state to state creates

797
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:20,000
tremendous amount of problems and that

798
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:21,769
all stems from the federal ban so the

799
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,809
fact that it's as expensive as it is

800
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:25,220
that insurance can't pay for it that

801
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:27,289
people can't use a credit card to pay

802
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,110
for it you know creates terrible

803
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:32,299
inequities and that would be my my main

804
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:33,649
message is that we need to fix that we

805
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:35,720
need to make it available to everybody

806
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,490
and I think I just want to echo

807
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,079
something that you said earlier you know

808
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,460
we do need to treat everyone even people

809
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:42,169
who don't know that they want to be

810
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,759
treated we need to meet patients where

811
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,310
they're at you know that's sort of a

812
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:50,150
basic tenet of internal medicine

813
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:52,250
medicine addiction medicine and you know

814
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:54,230
I think that you know the people in this

815
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,480
room and people who are interested in

816
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,150
cannabinoid medicine really need to be

817
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,559
making a better effort to make anibus

818
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:06,819
accessible to to everybody thank you

819
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,818
[Applause]

820
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:13,699
so I guess the one the one thing that I

821
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,920
couldn't say about policy is that as was

822
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,130
just stated the laws are really all over

823
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,050
the map with regard to the United States

824
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:23,260
every state has different numbers of

825
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:26,299
indications for which people can can be

826
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:27,980
can use cannabis and the types of

827
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:29,389
cannabis that are available because of

828
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,640
these state laws and because their

829
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,170
federal federal bans they're all over

830
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,960
the place and so therefore it really

831
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:39,650
does make gathering data on on a

832
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:42,590
nationwide sample really difficult so

833
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,870
and I guess this goes to this kind of

834
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:48,230
speaks to the federal ban but having

835
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:49,939
this some type of orchestrated policy

836
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,460
across states I think would be enormous

837
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,470
ly helpful in helping to elucidate how

838
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,600
cannabis and cannabinoids because we

839
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,120
used therapeutically not just for pain

840
00:33:56,599 --> 00:34:01,039
but for all the other indications you

841
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,929
know up to 35 indications that that

842
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,240
cannabis is used for across the states

843
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,500
and you know pain we've been tackling

844
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,000
this issue with cannabis and

845
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,309
cannabinoids for a long time but there

846
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,150
are other indications for example

847
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:16,159
anxiety PTSD and and other indications

848
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,599
mood disorders that are really important

849
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,418
substance use disorders apart from

850
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,730
opioids alcohol tobacco benzodiazepine

851
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:25,549
use disorder and this is critical really

852
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:28,190
really critical areas of research right

853
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:30,860
now that would be helped if we had some

854
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:33,230
type of streamlined approach to how

855
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,849
states were using or approaching medical

856
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:39,980
cannabis thank you so much and I'll add

857
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:42,619
that one thing that we know about access

858
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,829
to medical treatments is that Monopoly

859
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:47,839
and oligopoly is usually not good for

860
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:50,000
patients and not good for the consumers

861
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,090
in any way and I think that as we move

862
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,639
forward with medical cannabis perhaps in

863
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:58,400
a national sense which would be a dream

864
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,309
I think we really have to continue to

865
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,369
focus on supporting home cultivation and

866
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:06,259
cottage industry and not just for the

867
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,509
local economic development that it has

868
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,490
to offer which is profound but also

869
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,770
because cannabis is not a single

870
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:14,209
medicine it's there's such incredible

871
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:17,090
diversity that comes out of these

872
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:18,980
artisanal marketplaces that can give us

873
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:21,200
surprise discoveries about how to best

874
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,869
use cannabis or what parts of the plants

875
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,399
are most useful and I really hate to see

876
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:28,460
that squashed and so I'm giving you all

877
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,440
that message in particular because even

878
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,960
though you may not be policymakers so

879
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,119
often those of us in the industry

880
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,730
indirectly or directly affect policy and

881
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,519
while there may be a lot of potential

882
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:43,250
for big companies in this industry I

883
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:45,500
hope that all of you despite your goals

884
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,719
or in addition to your goals are willing

885
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:54,710
to support a home cultivation in the

886
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:58,730
cottage industry all right I'd like to

887
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:01,369
turn it to max now so we can have these

888
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:04,519
great scientific conversations we can

889
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:06,199
publish papers that show efficacy and

890
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:09,889
harm reduction and all sorts of other

891
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:12,259
benefits and then so often public policy

892
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:15,440
doesn't change for a variety of reasons

893
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,990
so this is a really tough question max

894
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,179
but with your experience in Fulani

895
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:21,979
philanthropy and social change I'm

896
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:24,889
wondering what can scientists and

897
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,929
clinicians do to actually make policy

898
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:30,319
change reality and save lives and

899
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:32,690
improve outcomes you know it's a great

900
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,130
question dustin i've been recently

901
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,570
actually thinking about this a lot

902
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:38,180
because i've been working on a project

903
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,980
in philadelphia to create a supervised

904
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:42,889
injection facility i think a little

905
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,389
closer i've been working on a project in

906
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:46,699
philadelphia to create a supervised

907
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:48,529
injection facility and part of what i've

908
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:51,169
been trying to do to that is you know

909
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,400
develop a research scope around that and

910
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,230
i've been working directly with the

911
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,480
governor's office in pennsylvania and

912
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:59,059
saying you know okay like how do you guy

913
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,570
what questions data points do you guys

914
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:04,429
need to have like this successfully go

915
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,590
through the state legislature like what

916
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:08,690
do you guys need to show people so i

917
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,200
think it's really you know researchers

918
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,010
trying to work really hand-in-hand with

919
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:15,019
administration's different state

920
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,880
administration's and municipal

921
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:19,699
administrations and saying you know how

922
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,490
can we help you and then more of a like

923
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:24,829
symbiotic relationship instead of a like

924
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:26,359
a hand-holding relationship i can see

925
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:27,739
that there's so much disconnect there

926
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,480
even just thinking about it i'm sure

927
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:30,979
that the four of us are interested in

928
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,409
research questions

929
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,300
that are just the best questions based

930
00:37:33,409 --> 00:37:37,129
on science right and based on our

931
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,990
clinical practice maybe those aren't the

932
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,670
best questions right you know me it's

933
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:42,439
like you should get maybe when's the

934
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,269
last time you've called like you're like

935
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,500
state like governor's office and said

936
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:47,989
hey like what are the biggest problems

937
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,179
you're having you know how could I as a

938
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:52,339
research or be the most help to you

939
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:53,929
I think we need people like you in the

940
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,269
middle coming to us and saying please

941
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:57,980
study this please you know that's the

942
00:37:56,269 --> 00:38:00,949
role of philanthropy so that's kind of

943
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:03,590
like yes please okay so what do you have

944
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:05,118
for us up here as far as things that you

945
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:07,970
think questions that you think need

946
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,820
answering by scientists in order to help

947
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:13,608
change policy around taking a chunk out

948
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:17,059
of this opioid academic epidemic I mean

949
00:38:13,608 --> 00:38:19,519
I think well in terms of cannabis and

950
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:21,409
we're still so early on that like we

951
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:24,710
don't even know what we don't know about

952
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:27,319
this we don't know what if the molecules

953
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,840
that were all studying and looking into

954
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,940
and thinking or being that like Meccan

955
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,920
are having the effect or really having

956
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,720
the effect or are there new undiscovered

957
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,510
molecules that we don't even know about

958
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:40,399
that could be causing these things so I

959
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:44,119
think really trying to understand what

960
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,599
the cannabis plan is and what the

961
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,970
effects that it can have and are really

962
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:53,509
crucial to start with I believe you know

963
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:57,108
science has the ability to take a long

964
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:58,490
time and drags its feet a little bit and

965
00:38:57,108 --> 00:39:00,380
I don't know if it's dragging its feet

966
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:01,939
or it just doesn't get the support it

967
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,680
needs and it doesn't always get the

968
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,659
support it means I know it doesn't get

969
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,730
the funding it means I know you know

970
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:10,699
here in the United States states are so

971
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,108
restrictive you know NIDA any clinical

972
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:13,789
research here in the United States has

973
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:15,559
to be done through NIDA and like how

974
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:17,929
restrictive is that to do you know

975
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:20,719
trying to show the positives of a drug

976
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:22,460
through like a drug abuse clinic and

977
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:25,759
only being able to study the negatives

978
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:28,059
of it so really you know just diving in

979
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,010
and you know looking for resources

980
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:34,460
anywhere you can find them to vacuum

981
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:36,890
research thank you all right back to you

982
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,320
Ziva what cautions do you have for us

983
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:41,599
clinicians that are kind of two feet in

984
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,400
in this field of using cannabis to treat

985
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:51,949
people that are dependent on

986
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:55,099
opioids what caution um it's not it's

987
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:58,838
not a caution I think it's when when I

988
00:39:55,099 --> 00:40:06,140
think about how we are all players in in

989
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:08,690
this experiment I think that in order to

990
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:10,969
demonstrate the legitimacy and I

991
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,889
speaking to a crowd here that all

992
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:14,318
understands the therapeutic potential of

993
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:18,288
cannabis so I'm preaching to the choir

994
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:20,599
but there are people who want to see the

995
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:23,210
data they want to see the safety and

996
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:25,789
tolerability they want to see efficacy

997
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:28,730
they want to see adverse effects and it

998
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:31,819
is absolutely imperative that there is a

999
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:34,400
dialogue between the clinicians between

1000
00:40:31,818 --> 00:40:37,308
you guys who are pioneers in the field

1001
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,440
and the scientists and the people that

1002
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:41,778
are doing the randomized clinical trials

1003
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,309
those substance use researchers who are

1004
00:40:41,778 --> 00:40:45,260
also interested in studying with

1005
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:48,559
therapeutic effects of cannabis over

1006
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:51,020
here despite the barriers and it's hard

1007
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:53,569
it is really hard work to do but it is

1008
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:55,849
immensely gratifying when you see that

1009
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:59,920
in compared to a placebo you see these

1010
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:02,690
effects of cannabis and in cannabis a

1011
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,289
particular type of cannabis or a route

1012
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:08,599
of administration or THC and CBD one to

1013
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:11,059
one ratio or 1 to 20 ratio it is

1014
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,369
immensely gratifying you see it on that

1015
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:15,200
you see the data and its data that you

1016
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:17,269
can show to the world that you can

1017
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:23,139
submit to peer-reviewed journals and and

1018
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:25,818
this is the basis of immense changes

1019
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:28,489
politically I mean you see what happened

1020
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:30,199
with epidemics and now the DEA and I

1021
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:32,358
know this is not cannabidiol across the

1022
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,598
board but the DEA has put that a

1023
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:37,670
Schedule five ok so what is that saying

1024
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,890
to the world about how the DEA feels

1025
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:43,099
about cannabidiol in general okay now I

1026
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:45,558
know it's only epidural five but this is

1027
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:47,539
a huge shift in public perception what

1028
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,569
happened with epidemics is it's the

1029
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:53,480
first indication for which a cannabinoid

1030
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:55,329
was approved by the FDA in close to 30

1031
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,760
years that is big

1032
00:41:55,329 --> 00:42:00,239
and it's plant-derived that's also huge

1033
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,010
so and I guess what I'm saying is that

1034
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,750
increased dialogue between the

1035
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,010
clinicians between the scientists

1036
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,329
between the people that want to do the

1037
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:10,840
randomized controlled trials and

1038
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:12,519
recognize the power of the RCTs they

1039
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,350
have immense power to be able to speak

1040
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:16,860
to the public and demonstrate this is

1041
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:19,119
what we know the plant can actually do

1042
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:21,579
increased communication is what we're

1043
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,039
doing here so thank you Ziva

1044
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:26,710
now cannabis is so different from other

1045
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:28,900
pharmaceutical drugs right in it's an

1046
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,460
incredibly broad dosing range and all

1047
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,769
these different constituents that can

1048
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:35,019
change its effects and it's often used

1049
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:37,150
in the clinic not like a drug but in a

1050
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,829
very pragmatic approach where there's

1051
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:40,960
different delivery methods and dosing

1052
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:42,819
strategies based on the individuals

1053
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,800
presentation it's it's very much

1054
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,380
individualized medicine as was mentioned

1055
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,390
earlier today by heather jackson and so

1056
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,869
i'm wondering is there a way to bring

1057
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:54,969
that into controlled studies absolutely

1058
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:56,619
absolutely one of my main areas of

1059
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:58,480
research is differences between males

1060
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,849
and females now I know that's a big

1061
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,519
dichotomy here but it is getting towards

1062
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:06,179
precision medicine looking at we talked

1063
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:08,769
about differences of efficacy of

1064
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:11,349
cannabinoids in the young population

1065
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:14,139
versus the elderly population based on

1066
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:15,610
different indications based on people

1067
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:18,250
that have never been exposed to

1068
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,990
cannabinoids before versus chronic users

1069
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:22,030
or people who are using other

1070
00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:25,389
medications these are subsets of

1071
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:27,210
populations that can be that should be

1072
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:29,619
studied with regards to understanding

1073
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:33,429
what are the therapeutic windows of

1074
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:34,989
effects how can we predict or what

1075
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:39,429
science can we build to be able to

1076
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:41,019
predict outcome and I think with all all

1077
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:44,349
the brains together we can put together

1078
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:48,190
a large data set where we can actually

1079
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:50,500
be able to determine this dose of

1080
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,480
cannabidiol administered with this

1081
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,849
terpene administered in this way it

1082
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,050
might be most effective of course you

1083
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:58,929
know this is the case with a lot of

1084
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:01,570
pharmaceutical drugs as well is that one

1085
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:05,469
size doesn't fit all it might be

1086
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:08,690
particularly amplified with cannabis and

1087
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:10,699
cannabinoids but this is an issue with

1088
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,170
a lot of drugs out there I mean you look

1089
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:15,949
at the medications that are used to

1090
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:18,079
treat depression or PTSD majority people

1091
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:20,029
do not respond to these - a lot of these

1092
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,380
drugs until why is that and we're

1093
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:24,079
working that out same thing with

1094
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:28,190
cannabis and cannabinoids great so I

1095
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:30,619
want to open to the panel to ask or tell

1096
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,539
Ziva anything for all three of you that

1097
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:34,640
because you have her ear right now and

1098
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:36,230
she's gonna be doing this research and I

1099
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,000
I just want to start with an observation

1100
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,349
that I've had in my clinic since you

1101
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,719
brought up sex differences

1102
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:43,068
I believe I'm seeing a trend maybe any

1103
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:46,309
of you could comment if you're seeing

1104
00:44:43,068 --> 00:44:47,960
this as well that women aged 70 and

1105
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:50,000
older that are on higher doses of

1106
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,460
opioids are less likely to get these

1107
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,949
profound results that I'm seeing in the

1108
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,690
rest of my LP using patient population

1109
00:44:54,949 --> 00:44:59,929
do you have any thoughts on that see

1110
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,519
that is so interesting that's because so

1111
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:03,348
what you're seeing is that cannabis or

1112
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,750
the cannabinoid that you're using isn't

1113
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:07,849
as effective for those typically they're

1114
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,440
more talent that they're less responsive

1115
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:11,059
to the cannabis so I start seeing a

1116
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,940
signal at a much higher dose than

1117
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:16,578
expected you compared to men of the same

1118
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,500
age or women of younger age and then I'm

1119
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:20,300
they might start feeling the cannabis

1120
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,800
and they're not breaking their tablets

1121
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,780
in half and they're not getting this

1122
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,220
strong potentiating effect

1123
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,990
this isn't across the board but I think

1124
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:28,789
this is a trend right and it's not to

1125
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:31,789
say that this isn't effective and women

1126
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:34,099
we have to understand a what

1127
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:36,559
mechanistically biologically why isn't

1128
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:39,190
it effective and be how can which

1129
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:41,420
strategies can be utilized to help

1130
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,190
amplify the therapeutic effects of

1131
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,139
cannabis in this population and actually

1132
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,630
so I have seen the same type of thing in

1133
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:50,960
in our population younger participants

1134
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:53,329
and only cannabis using but we see this

1135
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,670
tolerance that has developed among women

1136
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:57,560
at a faster rate than males to the pain

1137
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,900
relieving effects and we should be aware

1138
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,659
of that because when a woman comes in

1139
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,880
and she tries cannabis or cannabinoid

1140
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:06,889
some type of cannabinoid and she doesn't

1141
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,440
have an immediate response it's not to

1142
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:12,078
say that there they won't be effective

1143
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,300
maybe a higher dose is needed but at the

1144
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,460
same time looking at the other types of

1145
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,730
I don't know if you see in your same

1146
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,710
population if there's the same rates of

1147
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:24,588
confusion or maybe

1148
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:25,789
xiety among the women as the men but

1149
00:46:24,588 --> 00:46:28,338
it's also important to look at those

1150
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:29,059
adverse effects as well absolutely thank

1151
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:31,400
you okay

1152
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:34,549
Caroline Julia or max anyone that wants

1153
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,740
Ziva's ear about informing her research

1154
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,750
or giving her questions that you think

1155
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:40,459
are important for her to answer I think

1156
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,019
that one thing that's really important

1157
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,420
for everyone to keep in mind is that

1158
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:47,300
there's um you know there's a there's a

1159
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,940
there's a lot of space between opioid

1160
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,589
use disorder and chronic pain and in

1161
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,200
some cases they overlap but they're not

1162
00:46:51,588 --> 00:46:56,659
the same condition and so some people

1163
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:58,909
who have chronic pain develop opioid use

1164
00:46:56,659 --> 00:47:01,039
disorder and some people have opioid use

1165
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:02,750
disorder also have chronic pain but they

1166
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,730
need to be thought about separately and

1167
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:07,400
treated separately and so when we think

1168
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:10,039
about using different cannabinoids for

1169
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,230
treating chronic pain that's that's you

1170
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:14,690
know one paradigm and even chronic pain

1171
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:16,550
is a problematic term because there's

1172
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,980
many different conditions that lead to

1173
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,539
chronic pain and I would I my thought

1174
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,980
when you were speaking Dustin was well

1175
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:23,750
what what condition are those older

1176
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,300
women coming in with you know and is it

1177
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,739
is it are you are you effectively you

1178
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,990
know controlling for all the potential

1179
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:31,608
confounders like are they more likely to

1180
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:32,838
have fibromyalgia are they less likely

1181
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:35,889
to have neuropathy you know is it a

1182
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:39,019
condition based issue but that's tangent

1183
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:42,348
those the issue with um opioid use

1184
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:44,358
disorder is cannabis may alleviate some

1185
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:45,769
of the withdrawal symptoms that people

1186
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:48,588
are coming down off their opioids but

1187
00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:50,329
it's I don't we don't really have data

1188
00:47:48,588 --> 00:47:52,219
to suggest that cannabis is going to

1189
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:53,960
treat opioid use disorder it's not going

1190
00:47:52,219 --> 00:47:55,730
to occupy the same receptor something

1191
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,280
has to occupy the opioid receptors

1192
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:01,190
either an agonist or antagonist and so

1193
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,440
what you know what is what is the

1194
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:05,869
crossover at the receptor level between

1195
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,940
the endocannabinoid system and mu and

1196
00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:12,380
Kappa opioid receptors that might

1197
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:14,800
potentially make cannabis effective in

1198
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:18,410
treating either opioid use disorder or

1199
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,269
opioid use opioid withdrawal symptoms

1200
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:22,368
because if there's a wholly separate

1201
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:24,650
issue than treating chronic pain thank

1202
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:26,210
you I appreciate that but perhaps not an

1203
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:28,430
agonist or an antagonist but an

1204
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:30,050
endogenous actor

1205
00:48:28,429 --> 00:48:32,989
it could be part of that treatment I

1206
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:35,000
think the the framework for treating

1207
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:37,009
opioid use disorder with medication

1208
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,170
assisted therapy where there's this non

1209
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,880
pharmacologic component is something

1210
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:42,200
that we need to model with as we roll

1211
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,059
out cannabis to that patient population

1212
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:46,099
you can't just throw cannabis at them

1213
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:48,500
but when cannabis is in the context of

1214
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:50,269
education on how to use it in the

1215
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,650
optimal way I think we're gonna see much

1216
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:53,420
better results let me throw out one

1217
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:56,269
other idea okay okay and before you do

1218
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:58,130
just to clarify is this timeline right

1219
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:59,900
time for questions afterwards because I

1220
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:02,780
was under the impression we had a full

1221
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,220
hour yes okay so so you mentioned

1222
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,110
medication assisted treatment for opioid

1223
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:07,639
use disorder so we don't have enough

1224
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,780
providers who are doing medication

1225
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:11,029
assisted treatment for opioid use

1226
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:14,000
disorder so you know please consider

1227
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:16,250
helping people in your community to

1228
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,570
become buprenorphine providers and to

1229
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:19,550
treat opioid use disorder with

1230
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,850
medication assisted treatment then we

1231
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:24,860
can train those same providers to use

1232
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:26,269
cannabinoid medicine as an adjunct while

1233
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,610
they're providing medication assisted

1234
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:30,409
treatment Thank You Caroline any final

1235
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:34,099
comments yeah sure I just like to

1236
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:36,649
mention about impairment in terms of

1237
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:39,110
looking at naive patients versus regular

1238
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:41,420
chronic medical users on a day to day

1239
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:43,430
basis I have some huge concerns because

1240
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:46,250
in Canada with legalization especially

1241
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:48,799
is going to be looking at you know

1242
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:53,539
trying to put everything on a drug level

1243
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,830
like so THC of so many nano grams per

1244
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:56,960
mil that that does that reflect

1245
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:58,940
impairment and really looking to find

1246
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,530
what the best test is going to be and I

1247
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:03,679
personally feel it's probably going to

1248
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:06,320
be a combination of some form of a

1249
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:09,349
physical test neurocognitive testing

1250
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,850
instead of just using an isolated number

1251
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:13,309
which isn't really it's going to be

1252
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:15,769
quite difficult to compare but the other

1253
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:18,799
point with impairment is CBD we talked

1254
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:21,139
about CBD be non intoxicating but

1255
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,810
psychoactive however in some of the

1256
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:26,719
studies we've noticed on pediatric

1257
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:29,539
seizures that some of these children did

1258
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,129
have fatigue and so the question is is

1259
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:33,769
that because it's a higher dose of CBD

1260
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:36,440
is it a drug interaction can we really

1261
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:38,539
say that CBD has no impairment I'm

1262
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,090
certainly using that in the daytime from

1263
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:43,009
my patients who want to go to work

1264
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,510
but now there's some workplace issues

1265
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:47,420
and they're wondering if they are

1266
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:49,310
impaired or aren't impaired on CBD so I

1267
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:52,130
would look to the researchers to see if

1268
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:53,599
we can focus on that area since my

1269
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,490
patients are now well enough to go back

1270
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,139
to work but if they can't use their

1271
00:50:55,489 --> 00:51:00,589
cannabis how how are they going to be

1272
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:04,159
able to do that Thank You max any final

1273
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:06,350
thoughts yeah I mean just this is its

1274
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,000
first off it's like such so great to be

1275
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:09,739
up with all of you researchers and like

1276
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,099
thank you so much for pushing everything

1277
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:14,899
forward and you know I think just you

1278
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:16,730
know really working with you know your

1279
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,440
state administration's could be very

1280
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,599
interesting and like asking them like

1281
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,309
what needs to be done and you know what

1282
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:24,469
issues are you having in your marijuana

1283
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:26,389
programs that like really need to be

1284
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:28,969
addressed that could help you guys you

1285
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:30,769
know better the program and you know be

1286
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:33,409
a good model for other states you know

1287
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:35,300
one thing that became very apparent to

1288
00:51:33,409 --> 00:51:36,739
me and some of my discussions with some

1289
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,450
of the high ranking officials that were

1290
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:40,099
setting up the state program in

1291
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:42,409
Pennsylvania is that they just had

1292
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:44,119
nothing to go on so they just picked it

1293
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:45,889
from different states what they thought

1294
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:48,319
was good and it was like at the end of

1295
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:50,119
the day they they just don't know so you

1296
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,610
know I think you know science working

1297
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:55,099
with policy makers you know can really

1298
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:57,260
help us like stay out of some very

1299
00:51:55,099 --> 00:51:58,819
dangerous situations Thank You max I

1300
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,620
think we need one of you and at least

1301
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,750
every state because we're all busy in

1302
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:04,849
the clinic and in the lab I'm sure we're

1303
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,980
out there at the Statehouse talking like

1304
00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:09,139
you are so at things please keep the

1305
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,230
lines of communication open and help us

1306
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:14,420
make an impact thank you

1307
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:17,090
all right so it looks like now it's time

1308
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:20,659
for question okay here's sorry dr.

1309
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:22,490
McCallum my question is a new amazing

1310
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:25,730
work that you're doing in Vancouver and

1311
00:52:22,489 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm also from Vancouver and my question

1312
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:31,070
is we know that there's a shortage of

1313
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,929
marijuana our cannabis at the moment and

1314
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:36,380
it looks like that's not going to change

1315
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:38,359
anytime soon and so the dispensaries in

1316
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,130
Vancouver seem to be the ones that have

1317
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,160
all the information and there's being

1318
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:45,559
shut down so I guess my question is what

1319
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:47,389
do you see in the future in terms of

1320
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:50,150
physicians and what you're going to be

1321
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:52,549
able to access when we see everything

1322
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:54,250
being sold out on their websites thank

1323
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:56,320
you

1324
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:58,380
so just there's a couple points of

1325
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:02,080
clarification there so with legalization

1326
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,910
even though it was October 17th not all

1327
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,949
the storefronts were open across Canada

1328
00:53:03,909 --> 00:53:08,170
unfortunately there was a bit of a time

1329
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:09,849
management issue I think we we got ahead

1330
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:12,760
of ourselves so none of the storefronts

1331
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:14,429
are open in BC and in Ontario those are

1332
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,500
going to take a few months to open

1333
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:19,179
online sales are open this is

1334
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,250
recreational purposes we're talking

1335
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:24,219
about however the medical stream has

1336
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:27,039
been 100% preserved so I can still write

1337
00:53:24,219 --> 00:53:28,869
an authorization for a patient i fax it

1338
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,730
directly to one of the license producers

1339
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:33,009
in Canada those are the federally

1340
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:34,960
regulated growers there's about a

1341
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:37,960
hundred and twenty companies and those

1342
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,670
that supply of cannabis is preserved my

1343
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,179
patients have not had any access

1344
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:45,250
problems however the recreational market

1345
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:47,739
certainly on day one of sales it was

1346
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:50,289
like you're right sold out in a number

1347
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:53,589
of provinces I'm shocked they didn't see

1348
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:56,650
this coming we know how much cannabis is

1349
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:59,860
being used in BC even though there's

1350
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:02,230
very few registered people using it

1351
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,090
especially so the streams are separate

1352
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,360
and we really need to show that there's

1353
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:08,800
medical benefit to keep them separated

1354
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,599
however I think all of the licensed

1355
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,390
producers are going to be upping the

1356
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:14,980
ante I think that I think supply will

1357
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:16,989
kind of Peter out I think this is a

1358
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,510
little bit of a rush this is really a

1359
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:21,159
fad I think the average consumer

1360
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:22,840
purchased something like two or three

1361
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:25,269
hundred dollars worth of cannabis on

1362
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,890
their first purchase it seems to be that

1363
00:54:25,269 --> 00:54:30,039
people were just very excited me thank

1364
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:31,980
you okay next question please yes Eva do

1365
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:35,710
what do you what is the role of

1366
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:38,980
functional MRI or and pharmacogenomics

1367
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:41,800
in your research it's a great question

1368
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:43,840
it is not those are not areas that I

1369
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:49,630
have been invested in over the last ten

1370
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:53,350
years but they're really important areas

1371
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:55,559
that that need to be integrated in these

1372
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:58,659
double-blind placebo-controlled studies

1373
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,670
so does Cindy do you ever do that in

1374
00:54:58,659 --> 00:55:02,859
your practice like maybe that would help

1375
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:05,309
you distinguish you know what's going on

1376
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,920
with your older patients with that

1377
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:10,079
responding is certainly interesting

1378
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,000
ideas but we're just kind of boots on

1379
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,049
the ground and figuring out what to do

1380
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,329
with patients that have limited

1381
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:17,340
resources and ways that help them the

1382
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:19,230
best and so we we don't have that luxury

1383
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,990
but thank you I think that probably is

1384
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:24,000
part of the future Joel your question

1385
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:25,529
please yeah hi I'm a primary care

1386
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,300
provider in Baltimore and I did trained

1387
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,220
at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx so I

1388
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:33,990
have had the worst cup of coffee in New

1389
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:36,089
York one question I have is you know we

1390
00:55:33,989 --> 00:55:38,159
talked about the difficulties we have in

1391
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:39,900
convincing other physicians of the

1392
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:41,969
importance of this and I've run into

1393
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,220
that extensively in Baltimore

1394
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:46,949
any thoughts other than just offering

1395
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:48,989
giving talks or meeting with physicians

1396
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:50,609
one on one to either get them to

1397
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:53,729
consider becoming a recommending

1398
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:57,329
physician or referring patients my best

1399
00:55:53,730 --> 00:56:00,179
advice is to copy chart notes that

1400
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:01,860
demonstrates success to the primary care

1401
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:04,219
as many specialists as the patient will

1402
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:06,210
allow you to do sometimes the the

1403
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:08,009
conversation about cannabis is best

1404
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,300
brought up by the patient with their

1405
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:11,040
doctor to kind of preserve that

1406
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,410
therapeutic relationship patients are

1407
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,300
often cautious about that but the

1408
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:17,159
results speak louder than anything and

1409
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,420
so when patients are going back to their

1410
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:21,179
pain specialists are back to their

1411
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:23,159
primary asking for less instead of more

1412
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:25,019
of the opioid drug and they're seeing a

1413
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:26,909
chart note from a responsible internist

1414
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:28,440
like you that's documenting that you're

1415
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:30,599
following this patient medically I don't

1416
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:34,650
know what to speak louder than that any

1417
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:36,659
other comments I know I think for us one

1418
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:38,280
of the there is a lot of resistance and

1419
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:39,539
you know doctors are were just an

1420
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,180
inherently conservative Bunch

1421
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:45,179
and fairly moralistic so that's kind of

1422
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:47,369
where you're starting from and so what I

1423
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:48,779
do around I'm Steinem Montefiore is I

1424
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:50,429
just try to give a lot of Grand Rounds

1425
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:54,120
presentations to different departments

1426
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:56,909
and to be you know I try to be

1427
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:58,769
impeccable in the way that I document

1428
00:56:56,909 --> 00:57:01,739
things in epic which is our electronic

1429
00:56:58,769 --> 00:57:04,230
medical record and gaps or two positions

1430
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:06,619
yeah get back to physicians who are

1431
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:10,320
referring you know we we put out some

1432
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:11,880
some material like promotional material

1433
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,710
it's not really promotional it really is

1434
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,849
just reprints from what's on the New

1435
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:18,280
York State Department of Health website

1436
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:20,920
but kind of send it out to certain

1437
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,590
key constituents like Rheumatology and

1438
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:26,619
the Cancer Center chronic pain program

1439
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:28,590
that's interventional and we now have a

1440
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:31,299
really really in a short period of time

1441
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:33,640
extremely active referral pipeline from

1442
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:36,490
from those places you know to our to our

1443
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:37,900
cannabis program but but putting

1444
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:39,939
yourself out there or finding somebody

1445
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:42,039
who's very credible who can if you have

1446
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:44,470
access to being able to give Grand

1447
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:45,849
Rounds or other cm II kinds of lectures

1448
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:47,649
you know throughout the different

1449
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:51,159
Medical Center is that's been really

1450
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:53,440
effective thank you okay next question

1451
00:57:51,159 --> 00:57:55,420
just a short question have you ever

1452
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,130
thought about using a partial agonist in

1453
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,320
those patients you're referring to like

1454
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:01,950
partial opiate agonist in combination

1455
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:05,080
with cannabis to reduce their

1456
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:06,639
sensitivity to the opiates I haven't

1457
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:09,069
thought of that because most of them are

1458
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:10,329
on high-dose strong agonists and so I'm

1459
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,710
not sure how it would make that

1460
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:14,349
transition but I'd like to talk with you

1461
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:17,980
more about that next question please I

1462
00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:19,869
have a very basic question I've recently

1463
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:21,880
spent some time in Kensington

1464
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:25,179
Pennsylvania which has been decimated by

1465
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,860
the opiate crisis and I'm wondering you

1466
00:58:25,179 --> 00:58:28,929
know 80 percent of the people that are

1467
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:32,230
addicted to opiates were originally

1468
00:58:28,929 --> 00:58:35,679
prescribed opiates by doctors so in your

1469
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:39,730
experience as physicians as scientists

1470
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:41,799
as professors as advocates why our

1471
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:45,130
doctor is still prescribing opiates when

1472
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:46,870
115 people are dying per day well before

1473
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:49,809
I answer your question I'm sorry I have

1474
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:51,880
to take this opportunity to take

1475
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:54,460
responsibility as a profession for

1476
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,019
creating this problem this sounds to a

1477
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,179
lot of people like maybe it's a heroin

1478
00:58:56,019 --> 00:59:00,429
problem or a drug abuse problem but its

1479
00:58:58,179 --> 00:59:01,779
origin is really a medical problem a

1480
00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:03,730
problem that happens in the doctor's

1481
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:05,320
office and so it's it's clearly our

1482
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:07,240
responsibility to change that and I

1483
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,789
think one of the most important things

1484
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:11,500
is to get another tool into the hands of

1485
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:13,059
doctors that are managing patients with

1486
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:15,010
chronic pain because right now their

1487
00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:17,500
tools aren't very effective and so I

1488
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:19,960
think the answer the last question about

1489
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,909
educating clinicians about using

1490
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,190
cannabis therapeutically is a great

1491
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:26,109
place to start and if anyone else wants

1492
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:28,119
to know it's on us I mean you know we

1493
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:30,800
did it and we can say we were duped by

1494
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:32,750
Purdue Pharma but you know we did it

1495
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,700
now we have to undo it and so I think

1496
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,559
that there are a lot of doctors that are

1497
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:39,139
really trying very hard you know to not

1498
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,940
prescribe opioids there's a big movement

1499
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:43,190
in the surgical field called

1500
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,869
es enhanced recovery after surgery in

1501
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,940
which surgeons are trying to use

1502
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:48,679
anything other than opioids to manage

1503
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:50,420
people after surgery from IV

1504
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:51,980
acetaminophen getting out of bed like an

1505
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,690
hour after surgery running around the

1506
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:56,659
hallway you know really mobilizing

1507
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,610
people and are reporting very good

1508
00:59:56,659 --> 01:00:00,619
outcomes from that so where we turn very

1509
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:03,079
quickly to opioids you know to manage

1510
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:06,349
pain 10 years ago 15 years ago were

1511
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:08,929
really trying to not do that and and the

1512
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:10,460
flip side of that the bad side is that

1513
01:00:08,929 --> 01:00:12,199
we are seeing a lot of people who are

1514
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:14,480
being who were being managed by

1515
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:16,549
physicians that were maybe not so

1516
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,829
reputable and those practices have been

1517
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:21,230
closed and patients are being cut off

1518
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:23,989
very quickly from opioid medications

1519
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:26,179
that they were on for years and are and

1520
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:28,189
and that puts them a tremendous risk for

1521
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:30,169
overdose because then they get something

1522
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:31,550
fentanyl on the street or car fentanyl

1523
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:34,579
or or something else that's going to be

1524
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:36,980
lethal and and we have to deal with that

1525
01:00:34,579 --> 01:00:38,509
too so I think that physicians I mean

1526
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,190
the CDC has put out guidelines

1527
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:43,010
recommending tapering you know of

1528
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:45,230
everybody and then physicians are trying

1529
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:48,200
but you know we we can't do it by

1530
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:50,329
ourselves and opioids are number one

1531
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:52,429
effective for pain and number two people

1532
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:53,360
are dependent on them and so I think

1533
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:54,849
we're you know for the most part

1534
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,950
physicians are doing the best they can

1535
01:00:54,849 --> 01:01:00,650
thank you next question please

1536
01:00:57,949 --> 01:01:01,779
thank you for a great panel and thank

1537
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:04,130
you for the work that you're all doing

1538
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,870
ziva my question is for you you

1539
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,390
mentioned that your research subjects

1540
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:11,480
were able to use a lower dose of their

1541
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:15,589
opioid when they were smoking I'm

1542
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:17,240
assuming THC dominant cannabis and Julia

1543
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,559
started to talk a little bit about maybe

1544
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:20,719
some signaling between the

1545
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,210
endocannabinoid system and opioid

1546
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,949
receptors Eva could you maybe speculate

1547
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:30,380
a little bit on what might be going on

1548
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:34,189
in terms of a mechanism there so it's

1549
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:36,650
interesting because it's not that so

1550
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:39,769
this was cannabis with THC there's no

1551
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:42,590
cannabidiol on it and it's clear I

1552
01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:43,800
followed up looking at the ability of

1553
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:47,519
naltrexone to be able

1554
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:49,140
to antagonize cannabinoids analgesic

1555
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:53,670
effects and it's clear that it's not

1556
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:56,789
necesarily it's not directly mu mediated

1557
01:01:53,670 --> 01:02:02,099
MU opioid receptor mediated right so

1558
01:01:56,789 --> 01:02:04,400
there does seem to be some synergy with

1559
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:07,559
regards to the signaling cascade

1560
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,900
downstream of the immediate activation

1561
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:13,590
at the me Opie receptor when you combine

1562
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:16,289
the cannabinoid but to be honest I the

1563
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:19,559
the mechanism as far as I know hasn't

1564
01:02:16,289 --> 01:02:21,360
been worked out yet but it's important

1565
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,789
to understand that mechanism if we're

1566
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,530
going to look at other cannabinoids or

1567
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:28,800
other terpenes that might help to

1568
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:29,519
amplify the opioid sparing effect thank

1569
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,039
you thank you

1570
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:34,739
next question please um yeah have you

1571
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:38,250
found in your practice there's a certain

1572
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:40,699
CBD to THC ratio that's best to start

1573
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:44,190
patients on for pain

1574
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:46,559
go ahead Caroline okay so for paint

1575
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:50,579
somebody on opioids or just be ninja um

1576
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,529
both okay I think it depends on the type

1577
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:55,980
of pain so certainly those with

1578
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:58,440
inflammatory processes CBD is is a

1579
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:01,230
really good is a really good starting

1580
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,030
point and I I do try to use the smallest

1581
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:06,449
amount of THC to get the best response

1582
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:08,460
so frequently I'll do I do use a lot of

1583
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:11,789
oils and I'll use CBD oil in the daytime

1584
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:14,130
and th the oil at night if someone's not

1585
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:16,590
sleeping sleep is a great opportunity to

1586
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:18,269
take advantage of THC get some really

1587
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:20,670
good sleep and I've actually found that

1588
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:22,320
many patients don't even need something

1589
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:24,150
at during the daytime once their sleep

1590
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,950
has been restored they feel they can

1591
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:29,670
cope better with their day to day pain

1592
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:33,000
so CBD de THC night however someone who

1593
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:35,880
has a lot more neurological type of pain

1594
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,340
I do find that THC can be more helpful

1595
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,309
so frequently I'll use a one to one

1596
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:42,990
ratio CBD and THC CBD is nice to

1597
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:46,829
counteract some of the side effects we

1598
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:48,809
can see with THC so I do still use TT on

1599
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:50,849
its own without CBD but a lot of the

1600
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:53,489
times I'll use a one to one during the

1601
01:03:50,849 --> 01:03:55,559
day time and then of course oils are

1602
01:03:53,489 --> 01:03:57,839
great for long-acting coverage so using

1603
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:59,279
them three times a day and then think

1604
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:02,220
about vaporization as a breakthrough

1605
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,710
option so for acute pain or flare-ups

1606
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:06,329
it's another good tool no different than

1607
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:08,820
long-acting insulin and short-acting

1608
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:09,960
insulin or long-acting opioids a similar

1609
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,390
structure like that

1610
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:15,090
however we do sometimes see trends such

1611
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:16,829
as migraines may need a bit more THC and

1612
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:19,110
and different types of pain conditions

1613
01:04:16,829 --> 01:04:21,210
so you know there's so many different

1614
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,960
other treatment plans but that's kind of

1615
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:24,449
an overview

1616
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,369
thank you well all I wanted to add is

1617
01:04:24,449 --> 01:04:29,189
that on my free patient education

1618
01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:31,409
website healer com I have a guide on how

1619
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:33,960
to use cannabis to reduce opioids and to

1620
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:35,609
replace opioids it's directed as patient

1621
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,230
education and so that's something that

1622
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:39,269
people can access and I'd love to hear

1623
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:42,119
your feedback and and your feedback on

1624
01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:44,280
that document probably the last question

1625
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:46,559
that we are allotted time for all right

1626
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,630
thank you for adjusting the policy issue

1627
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,519
because here in California were ten

1628
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:53,579
months into adult use and it's harder

1629
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:56,039
than ever for people to access cannabis

1630
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:59,250
products that are state legal but my

1631
01:04:56,039 --> 01:05:01,949
real question is addressing the ethical

1632
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:04,650
question of pain management clinics here

1633
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:06,689
in California telling people if you test

1634
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,099
positive for THC we're going to cut you

1635
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:11,369
off I'd love to hear your thoughts on

1636
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:14,159
that well I think to begin with the 2016

1637
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:16,769
CDC guidelines on opioid prescribing for

1638
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,899
chronic pain stated very clearly that

1639
01:05:16,769 --> 01:05:20,849
clinicians do not need to be testing the

1640
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,700
urine of their opioid using patients for

1641
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:26,730
THC because that the results of that

1642
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:29,099
test wouldn't clearly direct clinical

1643
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:30,719
action and so we have the federal

1644
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:33,089
government saying we don't need to test

1645
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,500
a urine for THC and I think just

1646
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:36,210
bringing that information the pain

1647
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,039
doctors is a great place to start since

1648
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:40,050
it's in a federal document any other

1649
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:43,440
comments this there's just a lot of

1650
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:45,750
misunderstanding in general about you

1651
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,730
know about about use disorders this is

1652
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:49,320
not dissimilar from people who are in

1653
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:50,730
treatment and medication assisted

1654
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,780
treatment for opioid use disorder with

1655
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:55,139
methadone or buprenorphine

1656
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:57,750
being penalized for having urines that

1657
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:59,279
test positive for cocaine or THC or

1658
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:01,139
benzodiazepines or anything like that

1659
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,540
when they're not being treated for those

1660
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:04,909
conditions and it I think I mean to me

1661
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:07,809
it gets back to kind of a

1662
01:06:04,909 --> 01:06:10,250
a moralistic attitude which really

1663
01:06:07,809 --> 01:06:12,259
doesn't admit that we're treating

1664
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:14,570
diseases you know opioid use disorder is

1665
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:17,540
a disease chronic pain is another kind

1666
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:18,590
of disease and that instead we're

1667
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:20,329
thinking that we're going to influence

1668
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:23,390
people's behavior you know and somehow

1669
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:25,099
make them different people so I think it

1670
01:06:23,389 --> 01:06:26,839
requires advocacy on the part of all of

1671
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:28,250
us you know to the to the people who are

1672
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,980
making those kinds of rules and saying

1673
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:33,650
that they don't make sense looks like

1674
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:38,150
they may keep adding time to our clock

1675
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:40,610
here so let's take another question do

1676
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:43,610
you have you seen any of the research

1677
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:45,950
looking at how the opioid receptors are

1678
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:52,660
negatively allosteric ly modulated by

1679
01:06:45,949 --> 01:06:52,659
CBD and THC I'm not aware of any of that

1680
01:06:54,730 --> 01:07:00,199
let us know okay thank you

1681
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:02,179
next question my question is for max and

1682
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:04,159
it seems that everybody talks about the

1683
01:07:02,179 --> 01:07:07,369
subject of not having enough resources

1684
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:08,989
meaning economic resources to do trials

1685
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:12,009
and studies and everything that

1686
01:07:08,989 --> 01:07:16,189
everybody wants to have done so from the

1687
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:18,530
philanthropy side do you see there to be

1688
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:21,619
any movement to have philanthropies help

1689
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:25,010
out in funding these types of clinical

1690
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:26,269
trials yes I saw you know Thomas

1691
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:29,480
Jefferson University in Philadelphia

1692
01:07:26,269 --> 01:07:31,369
recently created a giant cannabis

1693
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,590
research institute and I think received

1694
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:37,219
a ten million dollar gift from an

1695
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:40,610
Australian individual the Lambert family

1696
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:42,679
and yeah so there's a worldwide effort

1697
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:44,710
really going into funding a lot of this

1698
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:47,899
research but a lot more of it is needed

1699
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:50,829
there's you know clinical research is a

1700
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:54,010
very very expensive game and it's

1701
01:07:50,829 --> 01:07:58,509
constantly needs more and more funding

1702
01:07:54,010 --> 01:08:01,190
thank you all right I have one question

1703
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:04,610
has everyone sent in their comments to

1704
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:07,369
the FDA about cannabis it's due by

1705
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:10,010
October 31st you can do it

1706
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:11,359
electronically or by snail mail I still

1707
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:14,240
have a few postcards that are already

1708
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:16,130
addressed so that's the question have

1709
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,039
you sent in your comments thank you

1710
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,869
thank you for the announcement

1711
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:22,029
I hope everyone remembers to do so and

1712
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:24,430
feel free to pick up a postcard if you

1713
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:26,199
need one alright let's head over here

1714
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:28,480
I'm curious to know if any of you

1715
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:31,779
wonderful people have heard of and/or

1716
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:36,429
worked with the Indonesian herb kratom

1717
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:38,409
in treatment of addiction yes so I'm not

1718
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:40,900
in treatment of opioid addiction but

1719
01:08:38,409 --> 01:08:45,220
I've used I believe they call it fort um

1720
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:48,189
over there which is a leaf of a tropical

1721
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:50,409
tree that has partial agonist activity

1722
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:53,229
at the opioid receptors at least at the

1723
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:54,430
MU opioid based on two compounds one

1724
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:56,229
that's a little bit stronger than the

1725
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:59,020
other but it's traditionally used by

1726
01:08:56,229 --> 01:09:00,579
people to promote endurance and to help

1727
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:03,220
them work and to relieve pain and is

1728
01:09:00,579 --> 01:09:05,318
kind of a social thing to use with vari

1729
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:08,319
as far as I understand very low

1730
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:09,910
incidence of abuse and so I've used it

1731
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,410
in my patient population I learned about

1732
01:09:09,909 --> 01:09:13,599
it from my patients I've had several

1733
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:14,979
patients that are off opioid

1734
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,859
pharmaceuticals that are using a

1735
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:20,139
combination of cannabis and kratom very

1736
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:22,030
successfully it also seems to have this

1737
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:23,740
bi-directional effect where low doses

1738
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:25,568
are stimulating and higher doses are

1739
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:27,699
sedating which is quite helpful for

1740
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:30,130
daytime use versus sleep I think there's

1741
01:09:27,699 --> 01:09:34,869
incredible therapeutic potential for

1742
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:37,210
combining these two herbs and many

1743
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:39,548
varietals and lots of quality assurance

1744
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:41,079
issues in the Croton industry that we

1745
01:09:39,548 --> 01:09:43,630
also deal with in the cannabis industry

1746
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:46,059
so we're probably a long ways from a

1747
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:49,838
widespread clinical adaptation but I

1748
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:55,930
think there's a lot of promise there k

1749
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:58,949
ra t om great I mean if we're not

1750
01:09:55,930 --> 01:10:01,990
getting cut off then let's do one more

1751
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:04,510
last question is that you met or David

1752
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:07,090
David go for it David okay you had

1753
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:09,550
mentioned the cost to patients as being

1754
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:14,020
a barrier to treatment and I'm wondering

1755
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:17,650
max why if you could put up the word

1756
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:19,480
that if one makes oils from buds which

1757
01:10:17,649 --> 01:10:23,559
are really made for smoking or

1758
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:26,759
vaporizing why not make grow or plants

1759
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:29,590
for oils like we grow lettuce without

1760
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:31,360
having to worry about insects and the

1761
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:33,670
curing process

1762
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:36,639
the other question is the idea of

1763
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:41,170
leveling out patients by giving them

1764
01:10:36,639 --> 01:10:43,569
like a a broad-spectrum oil to get them

1765
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:46,600
out of lay a level playing field so

1766
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:49,269
different people now will maybe not have

1767
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,980
different effects from specific

1768
01:10:49,270 --> 01:11:03,909
cannabinoids being added to their

1769
01:10:50,979 --> 01:11:08,948
condition did they cut off the mic

1770
01:11:03,908 --> 01:11:10,509
I don't think big miss purposes and so I

1771
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:12,759
there's people out there that are doing

1772
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:14,139
that yeah and there are certain

1773
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:15,820
varieties that are better than others

1774
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:17,500
but you know it's also very dependent on

1775
01:11:15,819 --> 01:11:19,658
like where it's grown I mean you don't

1776
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:22,479
want to grow a super resinous variety in

1777
01:11:19,658 --> 01:11:24,279
a dusty arid environment because the

1778
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:25,569
plant matters it's gonna be filthy we're

1779
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:27,789
gonna have to wash it you're gonna lose

1780
01:11:25,569 --> 01:11:29,799
a lot of those beneficial like photo

1781
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:31,899
cannabinoids and turbines from the plant

1782
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,400
so you know really like trying to find

1783
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:37,899
the best variety to grow in these

1784
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:40,238
climates and I'll just tie your question

1785
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:41,559
back into the conversation here I think

1786
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:43,629
in the absence of really understanding

1787
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,270
the different chemo varieties of

1788
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:48,100
cannabis and what might be appropriate

1789
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:51,460
one thing is that in combining a

1790
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:54,219
diversity of chemo vars may have good

1791
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:57,670
impact and also I agree with you growing

1792
01:11:54,219 --> 01:12:00,429
and extracting with an intention to

1793
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:03,190
deliver the cannabinoids oral mucosa Lee

1794
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:06,658
instead of via inhalation might be an

1795
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:09,129
appropriate strategy thank you

1796
01:12:06,658 --> 01:12:11,019
actually I was gonna talk about that too

1797
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:14,440
the difference between sativa varieties

1798
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:17,050
and extracts of THC from certain sativa

1799
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:19,809
varieties grown certain ways causing

1800
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:21,429
insomnia or not being having a

1801
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:24,100
synergetic effect at all with opiates

1802
01:12:21,429 --> 01:12:27,520
specifically and that certain strains of

1803
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:31,119
indica that worked very well and even

1804
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:33,909
the THC that's not pure THC there's

1805
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:36,609
other compounds in there there'd be more

1806
01:12:33,908 --> 01:12:38,948
of a whole plant tac drug predominant

1807
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:41,469
from an indica variety right well I

1808
01:12:38,948 --> 01:12:43,849
think it's when those fine details get

1809
01:12:41,469 --> 01:12:45,079
overlooked either because

1810
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:46,430
they're just simply overlooked or

1811
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:50,329
because all you have to deal with is

1812
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:51,980
NIDA 5.7 percent cannabis that that's

1813
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:53,720
really challenging and then the research

1814
01:12:51,979 --> 01:12:55,669
doesn't necessarily reflect what's

1815
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,930
happening in the clinic and what we're

1816
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:58,369
doing our best to bring that close

1817
01:12:56,930 --> 01:13:00,680
together so thank you for bringing it

1818
01:12:58,369 --> 01:13:02,210
yeah I mean just my comment had to do

1819
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,770
with that was a question you know have

1820
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:05,659
you guys noticed the difference and

1821
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:09,080
different material that you're available

1822
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:10,399
to get to give patients and and I wanted

1823
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:13,279
to you know the comment was made about

1824
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:16,969
high CBD and its effects and THC and CBD

1825
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:20,389
together in TAC by itself but if you

1826
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:21,949
know sometimes THC is combines with

1827
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:23,810
opiates and the other strains don't i've

1828
01:13:21,949 --> 01:13:25,760
developed a strain called old tobe that

1829
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:26,780
could be the last strain you'd want to

1830
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,460
take if you were trying to get off

1831
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:32,509
opiates you'd probably do more opiates

1832
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:34,699
on that variety of hyper sativa so so

1833
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:36,470
many unknowns and nuances thank you

1834
01:13:34,699 --> 01:13:39,050
thank you for bringing that up I think

1835
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:40,940
that's it so thank you all for your time

1836
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:43,039
and attention and participation and

1837
01:13:40,939 --> 01:13:45,229
especially thank you all for making this

1838
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:47,979
a great conversation thank you to Dustin

1839
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:47,979
for putting us together
