00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:14,109
hi welcome to the cannabis safety

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:17,310
testing panel I'm the my day job is

3
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:20,800
director of Clinical Research at tilray

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:23,320
but I also serve as a member of the

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,880
cannabis Advisory Committee to the state

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,649
of California advising them on their

7
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:34,229
regulations in California and this issue

8
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:37,808
of product quality safety is really

9
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:41,279
maybe not very interesting to a lot of

10
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:44,530
you but it's actually critical to

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,129
elevating this industry and it's a very

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:51,480
difficult topic to cover so I have with

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,549
me here for chemistry experts and

14
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,498
they're gonna help us kind of discuss

15
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:58,268
this topic and choose apart some of the

16
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:59,829
most important issues that we need to be

17
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:03,189
thinking about and I'll let them

18
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,650
introduce themselves hello my name is

operate a slew of licenses for the

22
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,599
cannabis industry across the nation I

23
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:23,978
serve as their laboratory director for

24

25
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:28,688
our in-house analytical testing

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,079
facilities that are built within our

27
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:34,688

biochemistry and laboratory diagnostic

29
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:43,000

subdivision as well as their scholarship

42
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,310
chair and my background is mostly in

43
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,769
cannabis testing I've been doing it for

44
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,490
about six years now and I got my start

45
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,990
at one of

46
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,670
first independent analytical

47
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,950
laboratories in the state of California

48
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:25,689
and in those six years I've tested about

49
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:29,949
a hundred thousand samples of medical

50
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:31,990
cannabis at this point hello everyone my

51
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:34,539
name is Andrew Pham I currently serve as

52
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,340
the scientific director at Bell Costa

53
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:39,009
labs the first licensed and accredited

54
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,050
lab in Long Beach California I am also

55
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:43,000
the chair of the cannabis chemistry

56
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,910
subdivision at the American Chemical

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,310
Society as well as a court qualified

58
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:52,359
expert witness that testifying in over

59
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:54,490
two dozen cases involving cannabis and

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,340
I'm right flora noia president urines

61
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,530
friendship global sciences been in this

62
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,490
analytical world since 1989 I feel

63
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,460
pretty old but been really grateful and

64
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,120
going through all of the cannabis

65
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,950
documentation and with all of the

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,080
sciences going on with it and I'm here

67
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,449
to hopefully help navigate through some

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,760
of the quality pieces because this is a

69
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:18,369
really infant type of industry and

70
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,019
there's a lot of information that can be

71
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,569
learned from the past that we were

72
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,090
hoping to put together with this thank

73
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,739
you okay so I'm gonna set the stage a

74
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:31,180
little bit by telling you what I

75
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:33,460
currently see as a cannabis you know in

76
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,650
the state of California so so full

77
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,719
disclosure I have a son with very severe

78
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,370
treatment-resistant epilepsy and have

79
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:43,270
been looking for products that are safe

80
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,969
to give him for the last six years even

81
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:49,870
today if I walk into a dispensary I'm

82
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:52,629
not comfortable with the product quality

83
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,430
standards of any product that I find it

84
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:57,159
is Spencer II at least not in where I

85
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,170
live in Northern California I honestly I

86
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,599
don't know whether the product will be

87
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,729
contaminated I don't know whether the

88
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,889
potency is correct right whether the

89
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:08,229
labeling for THC and CBD content is

90
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:12,129
accurate and I think this is a real

91
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:16,120
problem and I'm a very educated consumer

92
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:19,269
because of my my background and I think

93
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,310
we're we're at a place where a lot of

94
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,740
consumers are not as educated and really

95
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,470
don't understand that nobody is

96
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,240
overseeing these cannabis products being

97
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,180
sold in dispensaries because right now

98
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,389
it's the industry itself that is

99
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,740
kind of paving the way and one of the

100
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,410
things that I wanted to talk about with

101
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:43,538
you guys today is how do we ensure that

102
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,460
the testing industry you know with with

103
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:49,538
lack of federal oversight and I think

104
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:51,489
the speaker from medicinal genomics gave

105
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:54,069
a good overview of how the regulations

106
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,750
differ state-by-state and how the states

107
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:58,589
apply different standards are different

108
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,228
they reference different pharmacopoeias

109
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:04,799
to establish their regulations but if

110
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:08,769
there's going to be no federal oversight

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,129
how can can we as an industry raise the

112
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:13,569
bar in testing to make sure that a

113
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,399
sample that is being given to two

114
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,159
different labs in let's just say in

115
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,448
California would return the exact same

116
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,770
results I mean that's the goal that

117
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:31,419
we're going for and so let's start with

118
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:34,029
Kyle you yeah you guys what are some of

119
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:36,609
your suggestions for you know rates for

120
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:38,319
the for the testing industry itself to

121
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,509
raise the bar I know you guys are all

122
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,490
for part of different organizations and

123
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:44,500
maybe you can speak a little bit to what

124
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,110
the different organizations do and and

125
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,019
which one might be the best suited to

126
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:54,158
set you know third-party standards for

127
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:56,829
all of the testing labs so for my case

128
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:59,680
example we're not an independent

129
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:01,269
laboratory testing facility we do have

130
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,728
laboratories within our vertically

131
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:05,740
aligned facilities and with that being

132
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:07,449
said we have to take into account local

133
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,220
jurisdictions across many different

134
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:14,680
states from my background in both pharma

135
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,830
and biotech and even in clinical we

136
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,259
follow strict regulations specifically

137
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:23,879
iso international standard organizations

138
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:26,590
and even more so specifically iso 17025

139
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,459
with my experience going from state to

140
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:31,239
state and dealing with local

141
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:33,189
jurisdictions is that a lot of the

142
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,728
authorities there for example fire

143
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:39,339
marshals if not County authorities rely

144
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:43,899
on people like us people in the industry

145
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:44,349
to educate them on how to build a

146
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:48,370
regular

147
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:52,060
system how to apply that on us so in

148
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,819
terms of moving the compliance and

149
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:58,769
regulation forward to make sure that it

150
00:06:54,819 --> 00:07:02,259
is moving towards a federal legalization

151
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:05,889
madmen we imposed local jurisdictions

152
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:09,610
and local standardization and also ISO

153
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:11,919
as a prerequisite for a lot of our

154
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,680
facilities and a lot of building

155
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,970
analytical labs and also developing more

156
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,160
methods it also speaks to teaching a new

157
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,000
generation especially with this new

158
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,850
version of ISO 17025 which takes out a

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,910
lot of the details from 2005 and leaves

160
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,670
a lot of things generalised but in a

161
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,970
sense this opens a door for innovation

162
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:40,600
to allow more creativity that still

163
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:42,160
follows compliance and regulations so

164
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,680
with that being said it gives an

165
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,630
opportunity for perhaps legacy growers

166
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,250
or people who have been growing and

167
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:54,060
things for 20 years in their garage who

168
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,620
say that they can honestly grow this

169
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,199
with a certain distance or whatnot but

170
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,470
unable to teach them to use objective

171
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,889
evidence like using an analytical lab to

172
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:09,570
actually track and monitor chemicals and

173
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:12,149
whatnot so it's important to use

174
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:15,370
regulations and compliance to not only

175
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:17,679
help this industry move forward but to

176
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,490
also help the people within the industry

177
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,189
to be more familiar with the progression

178
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,500
of regulation and compliance okay I'm

179
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:28,779
gonna ask Michael a question because you

180
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,269
come to this with background from other

181
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:34,689
industries so environmental testing food

182
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:35,978
testing what are some of the so given

183
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,010
your extensive background in these

184
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:42,460
industries which are well regulated what

185
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:44,439
can we take from each of those you know

186
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,840
regulatory standards and apply to this

187
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,160
industry and you raise a really good

188
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,450
question and technically this particular

189
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,389
chemical this particular plan this

190
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,620
particular food could

191
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,250
transcends a lot you know it's not a

192
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,929
drug

193
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,759
Marshall it is a drug it's not a food

194
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:03,189
what should you put it in food you know

195
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,259
it's really not something that it's like

196
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,290
a tobacco but it is because you can

197
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:10,360
smoke it so it goes across many

198
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:12,579
different mark as many different fields

199
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,259
that you know really puts it into a

200
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,600
different category so you don't really

201
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:19,450
look at it as a drug but FDA is there

202
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,700
DEA is there and they do look at as a

203
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,190
drug but we don't the DEA

204
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,220
really puts the clamp down even on the

205
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,480
deal T so being able to move things

206
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,290
across really makes it very very

207
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,000
challenging

208
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:33,689
and I know kind of looking back at the

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,309
past working with the EPA and the FDA

210
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,730
back when they were developing methods

211
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:41,049
back in the 60s 70s 80s it was kind of

212
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,560
like the Wild West kind of like it is

213
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,629
today

214
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,789
specifically on the analytical set on a

215
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:47,139
testing side you know if I recall you

216
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:49,029
know we were able to do one-point

217
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:50,860
calibrations back then we were able to

218
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,959
hold the calibration for as long as we

219
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,850
wanted to you know all of those change

220
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,519
because it was a very big need for

221
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,860
getting accurate data and so using some

222
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,019
of the lessons learned from those

223
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,000
industries from the past and we can

224
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:07,059
certainly use that information today to

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,580
make this particular process much faster

226
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:11,109
to the endpoint as possible and being

227
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,180
able to you know kind of distill

228
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,769
everything that we've done it all comes

229
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,629
down to validation that's what it all

230
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:19,179
comes down to um so if you're able to

231
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:21,519
get a good validation protocol with the

232
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:23,679
intention of having good limits because

233
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,779
that's also part of it that will

234
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,069
definitely get you to a point where it

235
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:28,899
starts defining what type of

236
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,850
instrumentation you'll need what type of

237
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,949
chemistry analysis you'll need what type

238
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,810
of processes you need to be able to make

239
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,570
things move forward but it also gives

240
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:40,299
you an opportunity to be able to let

241
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,129
technology help you grow fast or help

242
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:44,109
you get better over time because if you

243
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:46,389
start to constrain everything because

244
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,370
you've made it too constrained through

245
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:50,169
your methodology then it's really hard

246
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,870
to help technology grow so I think

247
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:54,759
that's kind of the basically striking a

248
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,419
balance between allowing innovation to

249
00:10:54,759 --> 00:11:00,669
occur in a very nascent industry but

250
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:02,469
still superimposing some of the the

251
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:04,329
standards that are common in other

252
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,300
industries and and one example for the

253
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,430
audience is common reference standards

254
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:12,579
don't exist right so a reference

255
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:15,759
standard is by definition the same thing

256
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,800
every time any lab uses it and currently

257
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,600
in California there is no reference

258
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:23,859
standard for any of the cannabinoids

259
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,649
which means that you can't call it a

260
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,339
reference standard right and in Andrew a

261
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,828
question for you might be what is your

262
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:37,779
experience been you know serving

263
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:39,669
customers in what are some of the issues

264
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:42,730
that have come up because of the lack of

265
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:44,169
a common reference standard well it's

266
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,879
the same complaint that pretty much

267
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:48,578
every one of our clients is saying well

268
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,379
we we're a distributor we take a same

269
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:52,359
sample to ten different labs and we're

270
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:54,278
getting ten different results and there

271
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,278
are so many technical difficulties to

272
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:59,320
overcome in order to fix this but yeah

273
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,958
an actual common reference standard

274
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,959
would be extremely helpful in really

275
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:07,359
getting everyone on the same page it's

276
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,919
honestly in my opinion if this can't be

277
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,589
done on the federal level I think the

278
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,689
burden is actually on the state states

279
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,880
have established reference testing

280
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,130
laboratories so if the state has a

281
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:21,100
reference testing lab they can act as

282
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:22,929
the referee you can present your

283
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,879
validation data to them and then you can

284
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:27,879
actually compare your data to other labs

285
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,769
who anonymously and I really think

286
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,169
that's the really the best path forward

287
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:34,958
because the state reference testing labs

288
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:37,059
won't really be motivated by churning

289
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,500
out results in order to make money the

290
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:40,149
resources are going to be from tax

291
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,429
revenues so they'll actually have

292
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:44,649
resources of equipment in order to

293
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:47,169
really get these methods together down

294
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,610
and be able to share these with the

295
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:52,088
testing labs that are doing this

296
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:55,600
commercially that's great

297
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:59,220
so a another problem we see is that

298
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,170
people use different equipment to test

299
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,028
products right and and and the equipment

300
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:06,370
has to be calibrated a certain way it

301
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:07,750
has to be cleaned a certain way these

302
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,110
are all called standard operating

303
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,839
procedures and so I'll I'll give this

304
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,300
question to kyle Boyer what is your

305
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,160
experience been when you see the

306
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:19,269
different types of equipment being used

307
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,329
in different labs

308
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:24,519
and do labs have standard operating

309
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,470
procedures in place that are relevant to

310
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,289
the types of equipment that they use and

311
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,090
how can we standardize that process a

312
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:33,959
bit more would it come from an external

313
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:36,399
regulatory body would it come from the

314
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,190
manufacturer of the equipment you speak

315
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,889
a little bit to that certainly yeah and

316
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,720
I think really what it is is we all need

317
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:46,149
to agree on you know what is the

318
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,100
appropriate instrumentation to quantify

319
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:52,539
or detect a given analyte or I guess

320
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,180
indicates microbiology pathogens or

321
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:57,429
species of interest and really what it

322
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:59,739
comes down to is the states need to all

323
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:02,049
come together and establish some sort of

324
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,639
consensus as far as okay here's what we

325
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:06,069
need to be looking for and then here's

326
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,139
the appropriate methodology to do it a

327
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,850
good example of this that I see is

328
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,100
Canada's microbiology my colleague

329
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:16,300
Yvonne spoke to this quite a bit we have

330
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:18,159
a kind of scattered mismatch between the

331
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,719
states some states are doing total count

332
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,179
tests some of them are doing species

333
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,590
specific pathogen tests some of them are

334
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:26,979
using platings some of them are using

335
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:29,050
quantitative pcr and in all these

336
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,539
systems they vary in their results and

337
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:34,359
their methods and I think really what it

338
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:35,860
is is it's hard to establish any type of

339
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,960
consensus when there's so many people

340
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,450
doing so many different things and so I

341
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,530
think it needs to come from all these

342
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,970
labs they really need to come together

343
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:44,470
and collaborate and speak with each

344
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,090
other and all these states they also

345
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,350
need to collaborate and speak with each

346
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,840
other what do you feel is the most

347
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,909
important in terms of patient safety and

348
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,769
what levels are appropriate and that

349
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:55,419
will then dictate you know what

350
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,460
methodology is used and what type of

351
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:59,110
instrumentation is used and as of right

352
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,850
now I don't think that there is that

353
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,860
consensus right now we're all scattered

354
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,810
doing our own thing and I think

355
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,300
California is doing a good job of paving

356
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:08,769
the way for establishing some consensus

357
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:10,809
because they've really done a lot of

358
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,509
diligence and figuring out what is

359
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:15,339
important for patient safety and I think

360
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:17,470
that you know we just all need to have

361
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,629
this conversation in order to arrive at

362
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:24,070
what is the appropriate methodologies in

363
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:26,200
order to keep patients safe so let's go

364
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,360
back to so I think we've we've talked a

365
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,310
lot about the problem and it's a huge

366
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,330
problem and it I think it's

367
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:36,399
gonna take years to address but let's

368
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,520
focus a little bit on the solution so

369
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,889
you you have mentioned different Pro

370
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:47,470
like different societies that you belong

371
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:52,870
to which would be the third party that

372
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:55,810
could take on establishing you know SOPs

373
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,310
or common testing methods in the

374
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:58,929
cannabis industry that are specific to

375
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:01,809
the cannabis industry and address some

376
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:04,199
of the issues that we see that that may

377
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:09,129
not be seen in food or Pharma or

378
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:11,170
environmental arenas um one of the

379
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:12,429
bigger areas that's doing a lot of

380
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,769
there's a lot there's a lot of a lot of

381
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:18,778
science going on a lot of research going

382
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:21,278
on a OEC is working really diligently on

383
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:24,338
developing methods that could do a

384
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,169
majority or a large amount of the

385
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,060
testing for different products and you

386
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:30,639
know being able to validate every

387
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:31,659
product it's almost impossible but you

388
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,338
know there's certain things certainly

389
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:35,230
the ways you can group things into

390
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:36,190
categories and you know if the AOA see

391
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,889
and some of these other organizations

392
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:42,720
can you know kind of push sorry Michael

393
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:45,069
what's the AOA see it's the Association

394
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,990
used to stand for Association of

395
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,180
analytical chemists but recently they

396
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:53,830
just changed it to AOA see so now just

397
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:56,588
answer AOA see yeah yeah you know but

398
00:16:53,830 --> 00:17:00,460
looking at just the methodology that

399
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:03,610
they're putting together a a set of

400
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:06,338
criteria as a set of quality criteria to

401
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,559
be able to do the process of digesting

402
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,678
or extracting and analyzing samples for

403
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,789
results to be able to mitigate

404
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,530
interferences and be able to mitigate

405
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:17,920
the processes so that you're getting

406
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:20,379
better quality data and not having huge

407
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,089
biases one way or the other but again

408
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,620
there's there's lots of different areas

409
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:25,958
and like I said this is actually going

410
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,369
to transcend just one market and you

411
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,600
know right now that we're looking at it

412
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:33,009
as more of a food drug type of thing but

413
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,059
it's going to get environment it's going

414
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:35,829
to get into the environment we're going

415
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,779
to test it in the environmental space um

416
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:39,759
so we have to start looking at exactly

417
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:41,309
what that means and then that'll go into

418
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,200
more APA style methods

419
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,909
and it'll be in the permits and all this

420
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,980
other stuff so you know kind of looking

421
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,259
at it from a standpoint of what do we

422
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,299
need to do as an organization and we as

423
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,759
a community we have to really engage

424
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:55,259
with you know some of the organizations

425
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,579
that you may belong to so that we can

426
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,890
try to come together on some of these

427
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:01,009
things there's other advocacy

428
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,660
organizations that are out there a CIL

429
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:10,920
the association of independent lab or an

430
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:12,330
independent or Association and I'm on

431
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,789
the board too what the heck

432
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:16,549
but anyways but looking at some of these

433
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:19,409
other organizations that are out there

434
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:22,259
we should all come together and be able

435
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,910
to help the government be able to put

436
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,700
together something that we can all live

437
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,620
with if we go back to the past that was

438
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,390
when the EPA developed the methods that

439
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:31,829
the labs were supposed to use and it

440
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,170
worked for a while but it didn't work

441
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:35,490
later the same thing with the FDA they

442
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,360
developed these methods and then the

443
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,359
Liao's were supposed to use those

444
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,949
methods well kind of it so happens that

445
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,959
some of these companies that are doing

446
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,819
the testing are pretty darn smart and

447
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,950
they're able to do a lot of these

448
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,359
developments on their own so you know

449
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,069
kind of looking at how we can put all of

450
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,079
this together we should we all need to

451
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:54,179
come together as a group and almost a

452
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,039
man we have to kind of demand on what we

453
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,410
think is gonna be best for the consumers

454
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,420
because the reason why we're all here at

455
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,390
the testing level is to make sure that

456
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:07,200
we're you know making our communities

457
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:10,230
safe at the EPA is community safety FDA

458
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,330
community safety even d-o-t community

459
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,309
safety so you know at every level this

460
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:16,379
is all about safety for consumption

461
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,389
safety for the community safety for our

462
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,410
children so I think we all need to come

463
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,970
together and put together something

464
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,950
that's going to work for this particular

465
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,500
product right and so you brought up

466
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,779
something important which is this comes

467
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,930
in a lot of different forms like gummy

468
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:37,139
bear could come to the lab a brownie a

469
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:38,519
candy and dissolving all of those and

470
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,160
then being able to run a test that's

471
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,410
accurate is and coming up for a method

472
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,710
for all of these different ingredients

473
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:49,380
is going to be difficult so where do we

474
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:52,049
so I see you know the end result what

475
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,910
the ideal would be but if we're going to

476
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,639
tackle it step one step at a time

477
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,500
what are the

478
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,340
important things to test for right now I

479
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:02,230
mean we heard that certain forms of

480
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:04,629
Aspergillus are much more harmful than

481
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:09,430
others and currently very few people are

482
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:12,190
testing for those you know what what's

483
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,529
the first step in Stanton in looking at

484
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,259
safety what would be the very first step

485
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:22,210
and the minimum standards and then we

486
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:24,640
can go from there so I think when it

487
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,500
comes to at least with microbiology you

488
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,330
definitely hit it with Aspergillus I

489
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,950
mean this is like a it's it's an end to

490
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:32,829
fight in the cannabis plant and it's

491
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,480
commonly found and it's it's one of the

492
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:36,399
actual pathogens that can kill people

493
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,589
that it's documented well-documented it

494
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,240
can kill people when it comes to

495
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:42,250
pesticides I think we need to understand

496
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,400
okay what what is commonly being used

497
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,490
and at what levels is it actually okay

498
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,350
to have them in for example things like

499
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,930
Michael butanol are constantly being

500
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,909
used and there's of course some research

501
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,460
that's was done to show you know that

502
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,320
produces cyanide when it's combusted so

503
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,860
that's clearly an unsafe product for any

504
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:04,599
type of smokeable product but but we

505
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:06,789
know what what is being commonly used

506
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,619
and established these limits based on

507
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:11,440
science I think that's what's currently

508
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:13,659
happening right now is no one's really

509
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,220
basing these regulations on scientific

510
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,110
research they're just taking their best

511
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,970
educated guess as to what is going to

512
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,829
keep people safe but that also puts

513
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,779
people in the testing labs in a really

514
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:25,299
tough position because you set the bar

515
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:26,829
extremely dear detection limits

516
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:29,289
extremely low and what's allowable to

517
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:32,109
extremely low levels it becomes very

518
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:35,109
difficult to actually comply with these

519
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:36,939
regulations because it again it's not

520
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:39,219
based on science but it's based on what

521
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,140
they feel is keeping people safe so I

522
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,600
really think that a lot more research

523
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,520
needs to go into what is an acceptable

524
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,799
level of certain contaminants in

525
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,690
cannabis of course there's also heavy

526
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,460
metals as well that need to be tested

527
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,380
for and of course that's something that

528
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,940
you know we should be absolutely testing

529
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,280
for all across the board

530
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,559
and I think no levels of heavy metals

531
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,119
you know they're very low levels are

532
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,460
gonna be tolerated but we need to

533
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,859
establish consensus as far as what is

534
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,850
okay and what is not okay and then as

535
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:09,889
far as micro toxins go that's

536
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:11,240
another contaminant that I at the moment

537
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,820
I just don't think we have enough data

538
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,169
to support you know how rigorously this

539
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:16,909
mycotoxin testing needs to be done of

540
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,530
course we see that there is Aspergillus

541
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,990
there but are the conditions sufficient

542
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:22,369
enough to produce these types of micro

543
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,069
toxins that could be deleterious to

544
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:26,298
human health I you know I think that

545
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:28,069
it's just there's a lot more research

546
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:29,990
that needs to be done in order to

547
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:31,849
establish what these limits should be

548
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,490
and right now we're just taking our best

549
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:35,899
educated guess at it but I think we need

550
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,909
to see more data in order to actually

551
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:42,980
establish proper limits I have one thing

552
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:45,230
way back in the 60s 70s 80s they did

553
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,849
lots of studies that determine what type

554
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,169
of chemicals specifically in the

555
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:50,750
environment what kind of going back

556
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,159
we're going to be harmful at what levels

557
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,500
which is how they've developed these

558
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,510
permanent levels I think we do need to

559
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,058
do that for these because you know at

560
00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:00,950
the contaminant level you're absolutely

561
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:02,480
right no do you have to speciate

562
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,308
something to be able to determine which

563
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,740
one is gonna be harmful for example

564
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:08,480
arsenic do you have some forms of good

565
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,980
arsenic there's some forms about arsenic

566
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,019
that that arsenic is really really bad

567
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,788
you don't want to take that but the good

568
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:17,029
are saying yes you can take a quite a

569
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:18,558
bit of it you'd be fine but as these

570
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:20,779
limits are progressing you have to be

571
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,509
able to determine what is going to be

572
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:25,970
important to the consumer might just

573
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:29,058
heard today that you know from a friend

574
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,490
I just met that North Carolina is using

575
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:33,470
an F fighter it's an instrument that is

576
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,529
not very capable of being able to

577
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,179
determine which is the bad portion of a

578
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:40,129
chemical that is trying to is trying to

579
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,350
do then that's we know basically THC and

580
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,179
T she's not really that bad but but

581
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:46,369
you're kind of looking at how much of it

582
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:48,048
is going to be the right amount is gonna

583
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:49,369
really be determine what cup type of

584
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:51,470
instrumentation you're going to be able

585
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:53,928
to need to do that particular analysis

586
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,700
or the species of that chemical so I

587
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:57,409
think there needs to be some Studies on

588
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,720
what it is that we're gonna be calling

589
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:01,250
important and understanding that that's

590
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,450
gonna change because over time you're

591
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,349
going to have different technology

592
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,538
that's gonna be able to do other things

593
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:07,099
but you know being able to determine

594
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:08,839
what is going to be important to the

595
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:10,038
consumer is super important you know

596
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,959
some of the levels that I've seen just

597
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:14,119
in California you know to me those are

598
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,710
high numbers based off of the cup type

599
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,139
of testing that we do you know for

600
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,620
example for arsenic as you know Quentin

601
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,930
1 and 4.1 ppm and then

602
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:25,419
or mercury mercury is bad but there's

603
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,789
someone working that it's not horrible

604
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,620
but methyl mercury is super bad for you

605
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:32,769
and if you have point zero five

606
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:34,209
micrograms or milligrams ppm of methyl

607
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:36,490
mercury that's not really good for you

608
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,870
not good at all so you know we have to

609
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,460
come together with what these type of

610
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:41,199
limits need to be based off of the

611
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,180
science absolutely right and just

612
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,289
because it's called arsenic doesn't mean

613
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,480
that's part of the science because

614
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:48,970
there's many many forms of arsenic so I

615
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,500
think that's the important part so I'll

616
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,120
just throw this out there because I

617
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,109
don't think you either of you answered

618
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,289
my question

619
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:57,819
which is what do we start with so so we

620
00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:00,159
know that a lot of research needs to be

621
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:03,178
done but we need to start somewhere so

622
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,990
so what do we start with right now I

623
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,720
really think it starts with

624
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,120
toxicological studies basically making

625
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,150
sure and seeing studying exactly how

626
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:14,558
much to me its pesticides is the largest

627
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,660
public health danger right now because

628
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,000
we don't have a great idea on how much

629
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,130
is dangerous to human health in terms of

630
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,660
inhalation routes obviously a lot of

631
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,330
these pesticides have been used in food

632
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,769
for decades but we don't really know how

633
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:29,409
dangerous it is when you put it to a

634
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:31,869
flame and inhale it so I think that's

635
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,759
really what's more important here I also

636
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:35,589
want to bring up a heavy metal testing

637
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,529
is obviously going to be important a lot

638
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:40,869
now that a lot of these vape carts are

639
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:42,730
being filled with oil the carts

640
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:44,589
themselves are being produced from China

641
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,289
which doesn't really have a lot of heavy

642
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:50,289
metal testing so contamination levels

643
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:51,819
that we're seeing in vape cars I mean

644
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:54,210
there's just not a lot of data right now

645
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:56,710
and I think it's an extremely big risk

646
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,390
well it's interesting that you bring up

647
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,390
vape cartridges because they're they're

648
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:03,910
putting substances in the in the vape

649
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:07,240
cartridges like peg and we don't know

650
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:09,519
what the long-term risks are of inhaling

651
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,529
peg I mean it's it's not a good chemical

652
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:15,429
and there's nobody overseeing that

653
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:19,599
anywhere which is really scary to me so

654
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:22,210
that's a separate issue though so if we

655
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,859
were to put in place certain standards

656
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,500
right now I mean clearly we need to know

657
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:33,299
accurate potency right because we want

658
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:33,299
to avoid overdosing as far as

659
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:39,319
contaminants what would be so the the

660
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:42,079
0.1 parts-per-million for arsenic

661
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:44,418
Michael is I think that's in the a HP

662
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,949
and the USP and it's it's okay with them

663
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:49,070
but now I'm hearing you say that that's

664
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,419
too high it's pretty high I mean based

665
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:53,839
off of some of the food studies that we

666
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:55,278
do is once you get into prop 65 went to

667
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,339
buy that out props to c5 once you get

668
00:26:55,278 --> 00:27:01,339
into serving size you know people are

669
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:03,259
eating grams and you know mini grams of

670
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:04,878
this stuff it adds up pretty quick

671
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:09,440
that's why you need to see lower that's

672
00:27:04,878 --> 00:27:10,548
the reason right so I mean that's that's

673
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,409
actually pretty scary to me because

674
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:15,079
that's the standard that almost everyone

675
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:18,289
everywhere follows the 0.1 parts per

676
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:20,138
million for for arsenic yeah where we

677
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:25,158
look down at point zero zero one okay

678
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:27,888
that's our MDL okay so in Canada we we

679
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,960
can't use pesticides because the

680
00:27:27,888 --> 00:27:31,939
government can't regulate the pesticides

681
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,769
right they haven't decided what's an

682
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,538
acceptable pesticide to use on cannabis

683
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:39,739
so we use none here the EPA has not

684
00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:42,348
really put out a list for which

685
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:45,048
pesticides are okay to use in at what

686
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:48,678
levels so does that mean we should be

687
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:50,210
not be using pesticides at all I don't

688
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,038
think so there's some naturally derived

689
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,190
pesticides that have definitely been a

690
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:56,838
readily widespread and available I think

691
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,389
you in California put out a list of

692
00:27:56,838 --> 00:28:03,009
acceptable pesticides are they not

693
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:06,228
California did yeah so really in the way

694
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:08,450
okay um I have something to contribute

695
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:10,489
to your previous question of where shall

696
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,700
we start and I think it follows back to

697
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:17,298
Mike's answers we should just all start

698
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:19,219
with validation proper full validation

699
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:22,519
because there aren't any standard

700
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:26,599
methods available to use and to be

701
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:29,479
accredited for in in the nation and so

702
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:32,689
we have to develop our own methods

703
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:35,119
in-house and yet those validated and a

704
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,460
third-party body to oversee that would

705
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:39,079
be going for accreditation to get

706
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,288
accreditation to get an international

707
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:44,628
standard accreditation you have to go

708
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:45,759
through an accredited body that

709
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:48,099
accreditation body

710
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:51,180
a part of a bigger national body that

711
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:55,119
oversees competency that oversees

712
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:58,240
accuracy precision of of labs of testing

713
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:00,939
labs including cannabis labs and so if

714
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,859
we start with a robust validation

715
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,220
program for any of our methods

716
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:08,799
pesticides heavy metals even potency and

717
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,559
then we a part of that validation is

718
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,509
also a robust proficiency test and that

719
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,240
feeds back to your certified reference

720
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:18,099
materials that need for that then that

721
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,200
would get the ball rolling with all of

722
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:23,019
us at least measuring the same thing the

723
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,630
same way all together right so you're

724
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:26,799
talking about proficiency testing which

725
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,740
the state could even oversee

726
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,299
theoretically because you're allowed to

727
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,430
develop your own methods you just have

728
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:36,519
to show that you get the same result

729
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:39,670
every time you use your methods but for

730
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:42,400
the common so how many of you have a

731
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:44,710
schedule one DEA license or do you need

732
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,850
one in order to get the you know there

733
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,400
are commercially available reference

734
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:50,109
standards and and are you using those

735
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:58,150
you see anyone using those do they

736
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:59,500
require a Schedule one DEA license so

737
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,090
there are actually commercially

738
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,430
available reference standards that you

739
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:05,199
don't need a DEA license with as long as

740
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,180
it's in a concentration of a thousand

741
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,980
milligrams per mil or less so that's

742
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,529
what most of the testing laboratories

743
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,089
are using right now there's also the

744
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,799
Emerald scientific has also started

745
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:18,009
putting out reference standards that are

746
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,980
in a hemp bud matrix so basically if it

747
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:23,200
has less than 0.3 percent THC it's not

748
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,910
technically unlawful to ship across

749
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,680
state lines although it's a really big

750
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,720
gray area but I think that's a really

751
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,480
good step forward because of proficiency

752
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,039
tests in the past basically only just

753
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,079
been these vials of reference standards

754
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,549
at certain concentrations and at that

755
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:38,980
point you're really just testing out

756
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:40,869
where your machine is all you have to do

757
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,579
is dilute it and put it in but it

758
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:44,799
doesn't evaluate your sample preparation

759
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:46,750
method at all which is probably more

760
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,549
than half of the reason that there are

761
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,279
so many disparate results so it's among

762
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:52,960
labs not only that a sample collection

763
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,759
is a really big deal if you're not

764
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,620
collecting the sample and a

765
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:57,158
statistically valid and representative

766
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:58,508
manner

767
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:05,049
then you're not going to get the same

768
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:08,909
result so we have about ten minutes left

769
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:08,908
and I think I'll open it up to questions

770
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:13,658
hi there I would my name is Dianne

771
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:15,249
Strauss and I'm a part of the a member

772
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:16,359
of the hemp roundtable I'm not sure if

773
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,548
you guys are familiar with the hemp our

774
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:21,759
own table or not but the hemp roundtable

775
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:25,479
has put forth a great great amount of

776
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:28,389
resources to produce a hemp

777
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:31,149
certification program that has been

778
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:34,598
created by where food comes from where

779
00:31:31,148 --> 00:31:37,028
food comes from is a an agency that

780
00:31:34,598 --> 00:31:38,769
developed the USDA Organic Standards and

781
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,388
has developed many organics and many

782
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:43,778
other standards and certification

783
00:31:40,388 --> 00:31:47,019
programs for a lot of the food industry

784
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:48,579
and it is going to be validated by

785
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:53,069
validus they are going to be the third

786
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:57,489
party audit on this program for hemp

787
00:31:53,069 --> 00:32:00,668
producers growers and processors it is

788
00:31:57,489 --> 00:32:04,840
going to be unveiled at HIA in Los

789
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:08,710
Angeles the HIA show starts I think on

790
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:12,398
November 2nd or 3rd of this month and it

791
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,720
does address a lot of the things that

792
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,868
we're talking that you guys have been

793
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,819
bringing up and in the hemp industry we

794
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:20,048
felt that it was imperative that the

795
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:22,528
industry itself started studying

796
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:25,450
standards so that people could have

797
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:27,460
confidence and safety and the testing

798
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,139
and in the Processing's of which what in

799
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:33,460
weight things are being produced and

800
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:35,228
being offered to the public so soon you

801
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,679
will be able to go it's not quite up yet

802
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:41,259
the URL and the website for our landing

803
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,919
page to see the standards I'm sure that

804
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:47,139
they would love to get feedback from any

805
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,659
people on the certification method that

806
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:52,118
was created it will be an ongoing and an

807
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:55,389
improving certification program and will

808
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:58,778
be available January 1st and again my

809
00:32:55,388 --> 00:33:01,089
name is Diane Straus and it'll be I

810
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:02,710
think it's gonna be it's us hemp

811
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:05,888
Authority org

812
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:08,950
u.s. hemp Authority org will be the URL

813
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:10,178
that will be or you could also go to the

814
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,650
OSM prone table I'm sure there'll be a

815
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:14,538
link but

816
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:16,159
you hopefully in those standards can

817
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:18,798
also be used and the cannabis industry

818
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,080
mean in the THC industry as well even

819
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:23,779
though this is specifically certifying

820
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,699
to show that it is less than 0.3 and it

821
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:28,099
has the GMP standards that are going to

822
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:31,700
be needed from from grower all the way

823
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:37,308
from seed to processing thank you you

824
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:39,558
sure hi my name is David sure I own a

825
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:42,408
specialty chemical company dealing with

826
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:44,149
chromatography so we work with you know

827
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:46,100
you want to know about the process and

828
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,650
the best way to to deal with that I

829
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:50,899
think it's the stationary phase people

830
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:53,269
that make sample prep products that you

831
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,490
need to work with those who make us b'e

832
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:58,339
cartridges those who make the analytical

833
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:01,579
instruments such as shimasu and working

834
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:03,859
with them to define the best methods for

835
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:06,589
sample prep because that is right now

836
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:10,339
one of the biggest problems that we've

837
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:13,398
seen in trying to determine proper

838
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,588
concentration of pesticides etc but my

839
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:18,559
company right now is defining a true

840
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:21,079
method for decontaminating pesticides

841
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,148
from cannabis extracts so we're

842
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,668
currently in an alpha stage with that

843
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:27,829
and currently go into a beta stage so

844
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:29,989
I'd love to speak with any of you to

845
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:32,500
talk about that but right now you've

846
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:35,539
made a good point you've got the highest

847
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:38,389
quality of analytical testing equipment

848
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:40,668
and consumables for you guys to do the

849
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:43,399
best work the challenge is how to

850
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:46,069
successfully use them and you brought at

851
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,569
a great point about sample prep I mean

852
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,519
right now we're sending samples to

853
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,830
different labs the same sample getting

854
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:56,079
different results so when you have that

855
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:58,809
just as something for pesticides besides

856
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,509
concentration of THC CBD and other

857
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:05,690
compounds within that it is it is a

858
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:07,339
challenge but I go to the state the

859
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,920
people that make chromatography products

860
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:12,559
we're one of them so we can help you in

861
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,849
defining those methods so anyway I just

862
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,940
want to bring that up but there is a

863
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:19,099
process that we're making for you to

864
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,320
understand for total decontamination of

865
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:23,300
pesticides from the extracts while

866
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,300
maintaining the integrity of the

867
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,519
cannabinoids

868
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,660
so I'd like to talk with you guys after

869
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:32,340
thank you thank you hey thanks guys for

870
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:34,409
mentioning method validation I think

871
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,120
that's really important in the interim

872
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:38,779
until we get some actual standards in

873
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:41,880
this industry but I had a question about

874
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:46,110
if you see any usefulness in round-robin

875
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:48,750
testing as a way to you know compare

876
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,460
labs either within a state I guess it's

877
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,940
difficult to do that across states at

878
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,889
this point but could you just comment on

879
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,950
you know the the role you might see or

880
00:35:55,889 --> 00:36:00,690
not see for round-robin testing I think

881
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:04,049
it's great round robins are a great

882
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,820
exercise it really shows Delta's between

883
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,410
you know different results and kind of

884
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,420
going back to is a result your his eye

885
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:11,579
response on you know getting good sample

886
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,990
prep you know doing that size or even

887
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,610
something as simple as metals you know

888
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:16,619
if you have o oil you have to get it

889
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:19,050
into like an aqueous form and being able

890
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:21,509
to do that is not very simple but yeah I

891
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:23,460
do think there there is something there

892
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,310
yeah but we have to have someone who's

893
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,490
run round robins before to do this the

894
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:31,829
trick is that you have to somehow do

895
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:33,269
something similar across state lines and

896
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:36,869
then be able to bring all data together

897
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:39,090
or be you know just you know if you're

898
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:40,710
okay with just having a state round

899
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,970
robin I you have to kind of make that

900
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,980
decision if you're okay with it

901
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:45,119
but Timmy I think is great to be able to

902
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,920
do that

903
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,409
the good thing about the hemp thing

904
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,849
though is if we're able to ship across

905
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:52,949
state lines because we've been doing it

906
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:55,739
but the good thing about him is that

907
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:58,589
point three percent is a lot you know in

908
00:36:55,739 --> 00:37:00,329
terms of instrumentation you know humans

909
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,829
can see so much lower than that so you

910
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:03,690
can make tons of standards at point

911
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:05,519
three percent so no there is something

912
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,409
to that to be able to do a round robin

913
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,389
even at that level to be able to show

914
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:11,579
even on a difficult matrix that

915
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:13,529
laboratories can see similar results or

916
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:15,150
not and then based off of that

917
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,710
information be able to know exactly

918
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:20,519
where you need to target for improvement

919
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:22,320
I think there's also a technical

920
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:25,050
difficulty in doing a round robin it's

921
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,820
that basically having a single reference

922
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,289
material that's fully homogenized and

923
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,240
can actually be shipped across state

924
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:33,900
lines it's really hard like how do I

925
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:36,029
find a butane hash oil sample with exact

926
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,470
same amount of butane and how can I ship

927
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,140
that to other labs to

928
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:41,489
among my results so it's definitely

929
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:44,969
going to be helpful but there it's

930
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:47,159
definitely challenging right now I think

931
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:50,129
the round-robin testing or ring test is

932
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:53,819
I'm used to calling them is definitely a

933
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:55,769
really good idea the thing that is that

934
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,840
we're seeing at least in within certain

935
00:37:55,769 --> 00:38:01,349
states like I know that recently there

936
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,510
was a publisher publication out in the

937
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:05,190
journal Nature that took a look at all

938
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,440
the Washington State labs and took a

939
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,240
look at the potency results and you saw

940
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,429
quite a bit of variance between the labs

941
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:13,469
and you could always pinpoint you know

942
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:15,449
where a certain result came from and I

943
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:17,608
think that comes down to you know well I

944
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:18,750
was a sample of being prepped how how is

945
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:21,269
the instrument being calibrated what

946
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:23,940
instrumentation are you using and being

947
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:25,590
able to see you know the distribution of

948
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,480
how people report the results is

949
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,910
definitely very important and I think

950
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,829
that should be implemented that was just

951
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:32,848
a sample of Washington state cannabis

952
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:33,750
testing laboratories but I think

953
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:36,300
something like that should be

954
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:38,099
implemented across nationally to take a

955
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,690
look at you know how our state's

956
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:43,559
performing between each other and who's

957
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:46,230
reporting the more accurate result as an

958
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:49,889
internal auditor I would say yes do a

959
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:52,679
round robin the standard for ISO says

960
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:55,319
for in-house develop methods you either

961
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,659
had to partake in proficiency testing or

962
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,980
inter lab intra lab professor

963
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:03,929
proficiency testing where appropriate so

964
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,670
going for accreditation you really have

965
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:07,679
to plan this out if you're doing round

966
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:11,010
robins especially with your accrediting

967
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:13,079
officer for them to understand that this

968
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:15,930
industry does have a lack of resources

969
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,159
like reference materials we are strapped

970
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:18,929
with our hands around our back when it

971
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:23,309
comes to shipping samples even within

972
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:26,669
state and so it has to be very robust

973
00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:28,199
and for proper validation do not skip

974
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:33,150
out on proficiency testing no matter

975
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:36,179
what no matter how you can do it one

976
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:39,420
minute okay so my question is well it's

977
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:41,819
more of a suggestion I would say you

978
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,559
talked about MIPS and how they come in

979
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,570
all different forms whether they be

980
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,279
gummies candies I mean basically now

981
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:50,039
they're putting it into anything they

982
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,210
can find why not test the starting

983
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:55,409
product whether it

984
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:57,599
the oil or what-have-you that goes into

985
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:59,519
the mitt instead of the final product so

986
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,700
then you don't have to develop all these

987
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,380
different methods for all these

988
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,598
different matrices if you were to test

989
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,880
what's going into it at the start and

990
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,300
then know if it's contaminate it's a

991
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,980
free of pesticides or microbials just

992
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,150
that's one way we could do it and then

993
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,740
you would have to have a two-part

994
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,900
testing setup right so you could test

995
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:20,459
the oil for contaminants but then in the

996
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,430
final product you still have to go back

997
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,570
to testing for potency yeah and then you

998
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:26,039
don't actually know if the other

999
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,019
ingredients that they're putting in in

1000
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:29,759
it is also safety tested so either way

1001
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:31,320
you'd probably have to test it again I

1002
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,540
mean there could be pesticides and the

1003
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,338
non cannabis ingredients they use which

1004
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:40,050
is something we've seen a lot in other

1005
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:42,088
products it's as for a company with our

1006
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:45,240
vertically integrated labs it's

1007
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:46,858
important to test from conception of a

1008
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:49,669
product all the way to the end result

1009
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:52,319
especially when you're in getting

1010
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:54,869
materials from vendors question of

1011
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,670
Enders China and whatnot it's important

1012
00:40:54,869 --> 00:41:00,030
to test from the beginning you go

1013
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,769
through such a strategist process of

1014
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:04,380
getting to your gummy bears or whatnot

1015
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:07,759
which does require heat and require a

1016
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,930
lot of manipulation it's advantageous to

1017
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,030
monitor your whole process through

1018
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:15,118
manufacturing production using objective

1019
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:17,160
evidence by testing at every step to see

1020
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,890
if there's a part here you need a

1021
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:21,509
troubleshoot but at the end of the step

1022
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:23,759
especially depending upon which state

1023
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:27,050
state regulations require you to also

1024
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,670
provide information on the final product

1025
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,810
so it's important to not only do

1026
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,579
beginning and end

1027
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:37,130
but advantageous to do throughout the

1028
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:37,130
whole process thank you very much
