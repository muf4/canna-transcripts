1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,278
well first i'd like to thank the

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,960
organizers of canmed and thank you so

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,960
much for the gracious invitation to

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,040
present this year and i'm so sorry and

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,519
so disappointed i can't be with you in

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,519
person i'd much rather be there

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,320
trust me perhaps next year in the

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,800
meantime i'm uh honored to share some

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,719
data with you from basically a first

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,599
look if you will at open label data from

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,759
a cbd clinical trial for anxiety or what

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,039
i like to call high anxiety question

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
mark

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,320
when we think about anxiety disorders

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,480
it's important to remember that they are

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
the most common of all mental health

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,759
conditions according to the world health

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,679
organization

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,679
one in 13 globally suffers from anxiety

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,159
lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,238
does vary across age groups there are

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,919
different examples for for instance

23
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,479
within the united states it appears that

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,920
between the ages of 30 and 44 we have

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,038
the greatest

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
likelihood of having an anxiety disorder

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,160
interestingly and perhaps not

28
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,079
surprisingly the coven-19 pandemic has

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,118
not helped the situation

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,039
u.s census data revealed 42 percent of

31
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,079
people reported symptoms of anxiety or

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,400
depression in december of 2020 that was

33
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,798
an increase of 11

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,520
from the previous year that was that's a

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,200
that's a pretty big jump a 31 increase

36
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,079
so important to keep these things in

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,320
mind um anxiety disorders are generally

38
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,478
under-reported and under-treated and

39
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,719
lost productivity as a result of anxiety

40
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,239
and depression cost the global economy

41
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,078
somewhere in the neighborhood of about a

42
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,078
trillion dollars every year

43
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,560
so it's not as if there aren't

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
treatments for anxiety disorders there

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,439
are plenty of available pharmacologic

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,960
approaches including but not limited to

47
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:51,559
things like ssris snris benzodiazepines

48
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,798
maois tricyclics

49
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,719
5ht1a receptor agonists anticonvulsants

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
atypical antipsychotics

51
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,478
that's not the issue the problem is that

52
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,399
despite a number of options with regard

53
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,799
to conventional medications response

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,879
rates remain somewhat limited and

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,479
residual symptoms are often present

56
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,639
that's a problem

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,319
in addition adverse effects also limit

58
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,598
tolerability and adherence i don't know

59
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,679
how many times we've heard people say

60
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,000
yeah i took the medication but the side

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,599
effects were so hideous i had to stop

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,360
so limited efficacy of current

63
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,799
pharmaceuticals and

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,200
you know people's unwillingness to

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,959
continue with something that causes uh

66
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,399
side effects underscores the need for

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,479
alternative treatments for those

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
suffering with anxiety

69
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,799
the growing availability and popularity

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
of legal cannabis uh products combined

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,640
with higher rates of anxiety globally

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
further exacerbated of course by the

73
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,199
covet 19 pandemic has reignited a

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
long-standing conversation about the

75
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,119
potential effects of cannabis on anxiety

76
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,679
it's important to remember though that

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,039
when we think about cannabis we again as

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,800
i'm very fond of reminding people we

79
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,719
have one word um and we use it to

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,959
describe lots of things almost anything

81
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,400
at all from the plant um when we think

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
about products cannabis or

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
cannabinoid-based products uh very

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,439
important to remember that they can

85
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,598
either be plant-derived or

86
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,039
non-plant-derived so

87
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,560
in terms of plant-derived products you

88
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,878
can have full-spectrum products which

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,000
contain a host of cannabinoid

90
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,518
constituents delta nine thc cbd a host

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,519
of other cannabinoids as well as

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,200
terpenoids the essential oils that give

93
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
cannabis its characteristic scent and

94
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,598
flavor profile and have their own

95
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,439
biobehavioral effects flavonoids etc you

96
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,199
name it then there are broad spectrum

97
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,479
products which contain all of the above

98
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,878
except for delta nine thc

99
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,878
interesting uh and a completely separate

100
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,039
talk probably in terms of how we quote

101
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,079
get to xero because it's an interesting

102
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,479
approach

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,120
but broad spectrum products are designed

104
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,840
to capitalize on the the full spectrum

105
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
aspects of of having everything from the

106
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,000
plant that may be beneficial without the

107
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,560
potential intoxicating issues related to

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
thc you can also have plant-derived

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,479
isolates for example things like

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,239
epidiolex a single extracted compound

111
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,238
cannabidiol from the plant that's

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
purified so it has no other cannabinoid

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,759
constituents no terpenoids no flavonoids

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,680
etc

115
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,280
isolates can also be non-plant derived

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,799
so things that are

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,479
more conventional medications for

118
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,120
example the the we would call a

119
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:16,719
synthetic cannabinoid like an avalon so

120
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
it's it's not just one thing

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,000
cannabis and cannabinoids can be used

122
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,759
for multiple reasons in many ways and in

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,839
countless combinations so it's important

124
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,680
to keep that in mind single compounds

125
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,478
like the single isolated cannabinoid

126
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
compound that i talked about

127
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,599
basically

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,439
works very differently from a full

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,199
spectrum product right where you have

130
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,918
the broad range of naturally occurring

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,840
chemicals in cannabis including thc

132
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,599
and the entourage effect or the

133
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,279
synergistic action that occurs in the

134
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,960
presence of multiple cannabinoids

135
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,559
terpenoids and flavonoids is something

136
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,638
that can be leveraged

137
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,079
there are many who question the presence

138
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,079
of things like the entourage effect i

139
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,758
think it's becoming more and more widely

140
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,758
accepted at this point

141
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,400
especially since lower doses of full

142
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,840
spectrum products may in fact have

143
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,079
therapeutic

144
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,918
effects relative to single extracted

145
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,120
compounds there was a meta-analysis in

146
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,959
epilepsy patients conducted in 2018

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,360
that basically looked at patients using

148
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,000
cbd rich products these were

149
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,000
full spectrum products and and the

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,240
meta-analysis basically reported that

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,038
lower doses were required to retrieve a

152
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,879
therapeutic effect and fewer adverse

153
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,800
events reported compared to those

154
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,560
patients who were taking purified

155
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,000
products or single extracted compound

156
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,360
products so important to keep in mind

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
the relationship between cannabis and

158
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,879
anxiety is also a complicated one

159
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
there's been research suggesting that

160
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,959
cannabis use is prevalent among

161
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,199
individuals with anxiety disorders and

162
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,120
so the question becomes what are we what

163
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,199
are we really looking at relaxation and

164
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,519
relief from anxiety are among the most

165
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,680
commonly reported motives for cannabis

166
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,758
use and to date very few studies have

167
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
examined the causal nature of the

168
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,879
association and those that have have

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,639
failed predominantly to control for what

170
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,639
i would call related factors which has

171
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,918
led to mixed findings

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,918
most at this point believe that the

173
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,799
etiology of anxiety disorders is

174
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:09,279
multifactorial and not likely caused by

175
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,720
a single factor including cannabis use

176
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,000
so that's very very important to keep in

177
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,080
mind but there are still plenty of

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,680
people who are convinced that that is

179
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,800
probably the cause and not a solution

180
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,319
there have been several reviews that

181
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,840
have looked at the effects of cannabis

182
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,639
on anxiety

183
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,198
going back to 2012 there was a review

184
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,639
that looked um and basically reported

185
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,240
that outcomes were highly variable

186
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,879
cannabis may have a bidirectional

187
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
influence on anxiety response responses

188
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,839
as a function of dosage

189
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,318
uh

190
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,399
not incomprehensible certainly a later

191
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,319
study noted mixed findings with regard

192
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,159
to impact of cannabis on anxiety in

193
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,360
recreational consumers and i should say

194
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,800
right here

195
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
it's a very very big um sort of a big

196
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,079
part of the picture whether we're

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,439
talking about individuals with anxiety

198
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,598
disorders who are being treated as those

199
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,038
using recreationally and those using for

200
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,319
medical purposes with regard to how

201
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,959
they're considered and how the

202
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,280
approaches may vary in a systematic

203
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,038
review in 2017

204
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,478
uh there was a report that concluded

205
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,279
that cannabis use is no more than a

206
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:11,199
minor risk factor for the development of

207
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,959
elevated anxiety symptoms in the general

208
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,400
population and in fact the national

209
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,478
academy of science engineering and

210
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,159
medicine report in the same year

211
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,680
reported there

212
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,439
was limited evidence that cannabis or

213
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,199
cannabinoids would be effective for

214
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:27,360
improving symptoms of anxiety and ptsd

215
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,360
so

216
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,240
why so mixed

217
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,240
individual factors including but not

218
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,800
limited to things like your genetic

219
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,478
profile physiology other substance use

220
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,639
and previous experience with cannabis

221
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,399
are very likely to play a role

222
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,319
the impact of cannabis and cannabinoid

223
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,399
products on anxiety appears to be

224
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,280
related to the very specific and very

225
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,799
different

226
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,638
impact and effect of individual

227
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,120
cannabinoids for example research

228
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,960
findings suggest that delta 9 thc and

229
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,680
cannabidiol have different effects on

230
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,598
anxiety and that dose is absolutely a

231
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,160
critical consideration

232
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,079
when we think about thc we know that thc

233
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,960
can be anxious at low doses that is it

234
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,279
can reduce uh symptoms of anxiety but is

235
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,959
often anxiogenic at higher doses so it

236
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,519
can either exacerbate or perhaps even

237
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,878
cause anxiety at higher doses

238
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,719
there have been a number of studies

239
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,800
demonstrating this with regard to acute

240
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,639
administration i think the earliest one

241
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,598
that i have on this slide goes back to

242
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,079
2012 where healthy males administered 10

243
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,240
migs of thc exhibited increased anxiety

244
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,918
as well as dysphoria and some psychotic

245
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,280
symptoms sedation and subjective

246
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,439
intoxication

247
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,199
as well as increased heart rate

248
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
some later studies found that daily use

249
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,839
was associated with anxiety disorders

250
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,759
even after stopping the use of cannabis

251
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,880
acute subjective effects following

252
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,319
smoking

253
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,159
joints that contained up to 60

254
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
milligrams of thc and recreational

255
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,159
consumers demonstrated that thc

256
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,519
decreased calmness alertness and

257
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,319
contentment and

258
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,320
thc induced increases in anxiety

259
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,600
actually lasted up to eight hours after

260
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,920
smoking

261
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,680
among cannabis users female users report

262
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,000
increased anxiety symptoms relative to

263
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,000
female healthy controls there may be

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,519
some obvious gender differences

265
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,360
on the other side cbd um it appears

266
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,600
perhaps has anxiolytic properties there

267
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,639
have been a number of studies going back

268
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,879
um into the 80s actually our

269
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,559
our folks outside of the us have done

270
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,399
some really compelling work the very

271
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,479
first one looked at thc induced anxiety

272
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,440
cbd was able to mitigate the anxiogenic

273
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,039
effects produced by thc

274
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,440
the same group actually also reported

275
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,958
that cbd reduced anxiety induced by the

276
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
simulated public speaking test and

277
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,439
healthy controls and in patients with

278
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,040
social anxiety disorder and there was a

279
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
recent a more recent

280
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,559
clinical trial a double-blind clinical

281
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,719
trial in japan that looked at the

282
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,199
efficacy of 300 milligrams of hemp

283
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
derived cbd isolate so single extracted

284
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
compound

285
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,519
in teenagers with social anxiety

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
disorders and avoiding personality

287
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,519
disorders the cbd treated group

288
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
exhibited significantly decreased

289
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,278
anxiety relative to the non-treated

290
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,120
group so again rather compelling

291
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,519
with regard to dose investigations of

292
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,919
all you study products containing single

293
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,159
extracted compounds cbd only purified

294
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,919
cbd which exhibits an inverted

295
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,919
bell-shaped dose response curve with

296
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,240
limited dosage range for therapeutic

297
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,759
response that's important remember that

298
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
whole plant full spectrum products have

299
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,919
been shown to yield therapeutic response

300
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,919
potentially at lower doses relative to

301
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,159
single compounds likely the result of

302
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,360
the entourage effect or this synergistic

303
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,120
action

304
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,399
of the cannabinoids terpenoids and the

305
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
other players so

306
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,919
really really interesting just keep that

307
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,240
in mind everything that's been done so

308
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,679
far has been using single extracted

309
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
compounds

310
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,559
so

311
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,319
in 2014 i started a program called mind

312
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,119
or marijuana investigations for

313
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,839
neuroscientific discovery and we have a

314
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,839
number of observational longitudinal um

315
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,279
cross-sectional survey and clinical

316
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,040
trials underway

317
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,200
um the very first clinical trial we

318
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,958
launched some years ago

319
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,560
is a cannabis derived high cbd

320
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,958
formulation for individuals with

321
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,799
moderate to severe anxiety we have a

322
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,000
number of other trials ongoing for

323
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,278
anxiety as well which i'll tell you a

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,799
little bit about but this is the one i'm

325
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,200
going to show you some data from

326
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,000
this is basically a custom formulated

327
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
study product that i sourced the

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
original story is actually much more

329
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
interesting than the

330
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,720
than the final story but um the study

331
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,039
product wound up being formulated with a

332
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,879
naida based extract uh we've completed

333
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,639
the open label phase of the open label

334
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,120
to double blind double blind is now

335
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,480
underway and we actually have added a

336
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,759
third arm so it's uh it was an open

337
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,079
label phase

338
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,439
the double-blind phase includes placebo

339
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,479
the same product that people got in the

340
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,519
open label phase and a single extracted

341
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,519
isolated version of the study product so

342
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,360
study product removed everything except

343
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,799
the cbd that's underway i'm going to

344
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,560
show you data from the open label phase

345
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,120
in just a minute

346
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,719
we also have cbs cbd related project

347
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,799
focused on patients with anxiety and

348
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
agitation

349
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,919
basically i formulated that product with

350
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
some industry partners the open label

351
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,838
phase of that study is underway i also

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,600
have a hemp derived high cbd formulation

353
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,600
for folks with anxiety who don't quite

354
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,440
need the same level of severity

355
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,120
for the very first trial again

356
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,200
formulated in partnership with some

357
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,679
industry collaborators and that open

358
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
label phase is underway i just got

359
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,799
another ind approved

360
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,278
for patients

361
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,120
with a mood disorder so

362
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,958
in terms of the anxiety realm we have a

363
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
lot going on

364
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,479
so in terms of clinical trial product

365
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,959
formulation uh the products are custom

366
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,560
formulated uh by myself

367
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,078
and my program in collaboration with the

368
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,919
knight of drug supply program as well as

369
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,199
some industry partners and

370
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,120
chemists with what i would call

371
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,639
significant campus experience it's

372
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
basically how you go from taking an

373
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,120
extract that looks like that which is

374
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,838
this very very gummy rather unfortunate

375
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,799
looking and smelling um

376
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,320
product

377
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,559
that patients are definitely not going

378
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,079
to be able to use turnkey and turning it

379
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,679
into something that looks like that what

380
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,319
you see in the dropper it doesn't taste

381
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,559
too bad actually i have to say

382
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,600
um so this very first ever clinical

383
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:06,239
trial of a whole plant derived high cbd

384
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,000
full spectrum product for anxiety is

385
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,399
like i said open label to double blind

386
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,399
custom formulated solution four weeks of

387
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,559
active treatment and the basically the

388
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,320
study product consists of approximately

389
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,838
10 migs per ml of cbd which doesn't

390
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
sound like a crazy high dose it's

391
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
administered three times a day it also

392
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,200
has somewhere in the neighborhood of

393
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,360
point two four to two six or so things

394
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,519
of uh thc so at a three time a day

395
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,000
dosing you're under just one milligram

396
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,159
of thc per day under one milligram of

397
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,159
thc per day keep that in mind it's

398
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,600
sublingual administration and patients

399
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,000
are taught how to do it in the lab and

400
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,120
then they do it on their own at home

401
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,759
this is a quick

402
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,278
overview of the study timeline basically

403
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,879
we have a screening visit where everyone

404
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,278
gets a full clinical and diagnostic

405
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,399
assessment they complete a series of

406
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,159
anxiety and mood rating skills um sleep

407
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,639
quality of life and other scales a full

408
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,679
neuropsych assessment

409
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,440
obviously urinalysis and for some of our

410
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,120
folks early on we did a blood draw for

411
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,720
pkpd work

412
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,078
we then assess them every week with

413
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
regard to

414
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,039
anxiety and mood scales as well as

415
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,679
clinical

416
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,599
check-ins and side effect assessments

417
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,759
and urine screens

418
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,680
the pandemic shifted this at the very

419
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,078
end of the trial i will tell you

420
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,759
um neuropsych assessment is done again

421
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,919
at the end of the four week

422
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,198
clinical trial

423
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,759
and

424
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,039
basically at the end of the five weeks

425
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,439
we're

426
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,439
able to verify how much they took

427
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,680
and sort of back calculate every week

428
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,519
that they come in or every other week

429
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,000
oh sorry an open label phase they came

430
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,839
in every week um we actually weigh their

431
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,159
bottles on the way out and on the way in

432
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,040
so it's not just us telling them take

433
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,600
one mill one mill three times a day and

434
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,360
and then reporting um having them report

435
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,959
how what time they took it etc we

436
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,159
actually weigh the bottles out and weigh

437
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,679
the bottles in

438
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,360
we assess their clinical ratings and

439
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,879
their cognitive performance and we're of

440
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,199
course interested in the safety profile

441
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,198
potential for serious adverse events

442
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,359
uh urinalysis

443
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,599
was completed to look for thc positive

444
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,360
status over the course of treatment

445
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,839
which is another really important and

446
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
rather interesting finding from this

447
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,120
study so what do we do in terms of

448
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,638
anxiety measures

449
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,690
the back anxiety inventory is a

450
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,560
self-report measure it's a 21 item

451
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,000
[Music]

452
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,759
tool that can be used to screen for

453
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,919
anxiety and each item is rated on a

454
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,759
scale of zero to three it's a

455
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,159
descriptive of subjective somatic or

456
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,519
panic related symptoms of anxiety then

457
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,838
there's the oasis which is also

458
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,839
self-report it's only five measures that

459
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
can be used across anxiety disorders to

460
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,360
measure what we call functional

461
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,278
impairment caused by anxiety and it

462
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,039
measures both frequency and intensity

463
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,519
anxiety as well as the degree of

464
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,958
avoidance and interference with work and

465
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,560
social function

466
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,879
finally there's the hame or hamilton

467
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,879
anxiety scale it's

468
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:56,159
clinician-administered scale a 14-item

469
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,078
um metric that is basically administered

470
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,078
in the form of an interview this allows

471
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,439
for information for multiple sources to

472
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,120
influence ratings so we have the

473
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,320
subjective report we have the examiner's

474
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,078
observation

475
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
and it's been shown to be one of the

476
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,758
most if not the most reliable index of

477
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,320
clinical state

478
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,759
with regard to anxiety

479
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,519
so in terms of

480
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,159
this particular cohort this was a group

481
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,278
of 15 folks that's we set out to

482
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:24,000
complete open label

483
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,000
data or collect open label data from 15

484
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,039
folks we stopped at 14.

485
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,278
um

486
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:32,000
oh sorry actually we set out to collect

487
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,519
data on 16 people we recruited 15 and

488
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,879
one was discontinued which i'll tell you

489
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,120
about in one second

490
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,639
average age was about 41 16 years of

491
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,480
education and as you can see from their

492
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,799
scores on the oasis the bai and the hama

493
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,278
they all had moderate levels of anxiety

494
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,278
overall

495
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,799
of the 15 patients we enrolled we

496
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,800
discontinued one for the use of another

497
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,879
cannabinoid product one time with their

498
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,120
partner that was enough for us we had to

499
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,559
let them go um overall the study drug

500
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,799
was well tolerated and there were no

501
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,558
serious adverse events reported at all

502
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,879
interestingly and very importantly no

503
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,519
patients reported intoxication on

504
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,240
average patients used not three meals

505
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,959
per day but 3.48 meals per day

506
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,199
the daily equivalent to that is about

507
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:20,640
34.7 milligrams of cbd and uh just about

508
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,318
0.8 megs of thc so that's why it's so

509
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,600
important for us to weigh the bottles

510
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,279
not just take their word that they're

511
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,838
taking about a mil again they have a

512
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,599
marked dropper but still people tend to

513
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,759
administer slightly

514
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,079
different levels over time

515
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,640
so what do we have in terms of our open

516
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:41,119
labels results when we look at

517
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,240
the bai what we find is a 79.9

518
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,959
decrease

519
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,640
in self-report ratings uh so this is a

520
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,440
significant improvement in ratings of

521
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,400
anxiety they go from about a 20.3 at

522
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,558
baseline to a

523
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,200
4.07 at the end of the four-week trial

524
00:17:54,558 --> 00:18:00,079
on the oasis we see a 70.2 percent

525
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,160
decrease the scores go from 11.3

526
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,918
approximately to 3.3

527
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,480
and on the handmade that's the examiner

528
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:11,120
driven scale they go from just under 20

529
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,038
or 19.8 to 3.3 and 82.9

530
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,000
degrees so these are rather striking

531
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:18,720
decreases in self-reported

532
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,720
anxiety

533
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:27,119
at some point this will move forward

534
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,120
when we look at other ratings of mood

535
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,439
the bec depression inventory for example

536
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,599
a very commonly administered metric

537
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,480
designed to measure self-reported

538
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,959
measures uh or symptoms of depression

539
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,319
our subjects go from a 20 approximately

540
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,480
a baseline to a 4.4 that's almost a 78

541
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,759
decrease in self-reported depressive

542
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,480
symptoms profile of mood state

543
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,079
which allows us to look at

544
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,360
differences over time total mood

545
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,279
disturbance that's sort of your grand

546
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,719
total goes from 65.8 down to a 23.9

547
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,119
between baseline and four weeks of

548
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,000
treatment that's almost a 64

549
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,079
decrease so pretty striking

550
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,160
as i mentioned we also look at other

551
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,759
domains so in terms of sleep and quality

552
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,000
of life the pittsburgh sleep quality

553
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,599
index very commonly administered metric

554
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,319
looking at sleep quality here lower

555
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,319
numbers are better folks go from a 9.2

556
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,240
to a 5.8

557
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,240
it's uh 36

558
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
change and when we look at the short

559
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,720
form health survey or the sf36 the basic

560
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,559
measure of quality of life

561
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,839
we see some rather compelling and

562
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,480
striking

563
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,379
significant improvements in areas like

564
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,720
physical function

565
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,120
[Music]

566
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,400
energy emotional well-being social

567
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,519
function and

568
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,480
pain this is interesting again baseline

569
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,558
to four weeks of treatment um these are

570
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,000
these are pretty striking differences

571
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,839
over time

572
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,880
the only thing we didn't see and that's

573
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,558
pretty interesting actually because we

574
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,960
think of them potentially as control

575
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,319
areas role limitations with regard to

576
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,319
physical

577
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,279
the physical role that someone has to to

578
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,038
perform

579
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,038
and general health

580
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,798
so in terms of some of the other areas

581
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,839
where we might expect to see some change

582
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:07,279
we do

583
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,519
and then those two we don't between

584
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,079
baseline and four weeks

585
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,918
when we turn to cognitive performance

586
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,240
this is very similar actually to data

587
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,320
that we've been collecting for some time

588
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,319
in our longitudinal observational study

589
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,000
that's been going for several years we

590
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,439
basically look at people

591
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
who are interested in using medical

592
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,400
cannabis for a range of medical or

593
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,319
psychological or psychiatric symptoms or

594
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,559
conditions we look at them before they

595
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,798
begin using cannabis and again over time

596
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,720
we go all the way out now for several

597
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,480
years but we published a paper looking

598
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,798
at cognitive change over the course of

599
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,038
one year so we look at baseline to three

600
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,400
months six and twelve and what we found

601
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,079
was basically some improvement over time

602
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,360
again those folks are choosing their own

603
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,960
regimen

604
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,359
in this case this is a clinical trial

605
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,720
and what we see see is exactly the same

606
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,038
patients are basically demonstrating

607
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,519
stable or improved performance they're

608
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,200
not demonstrating decrements especially

609
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,720
in measures of frontal or executive

610
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,038
function this is just an example of some

611
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,640
of the measures uh the trail making test

612
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,038
part b not significantly different

613
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,038
they're certainly not getting worse

614
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,038
for stroop interference time or time to

615
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,200
complete a task requiring active

616
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,158
inhibition over overlearned response

617
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,240
tendency and we see a statistically

618
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,880
significant improvement with regard to

619
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,038
time required to get the job done

620
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
uh the wisconsin card sort it's

621
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,640
considered a gold standard measure of

622
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,559
frontal function total correct what we

623
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,480
see is a statistically significant

624
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,480
improvement between baseline and four

625
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,159
weeks uh we also see the same thing in

626
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,599
the number of categories achieved on the

627
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,280
wisconsin card sorry so they're getting

628
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,439
better they're not getting worse over

629
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,678
time that's important especially when we

630
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,919
consider what we know to be the case in

631
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,759
recreational consumers very often we see

632
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,640
decrements in areas of executive

633
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,240
function

634
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,440
we have some other measures of executive

635
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,759
function

636
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,840
the letter number sequencing task and a

637
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,079
task of phonemic fluency

638
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,720
again we're seeing either stable or

639
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:03,199
improved performance patterns not

640
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
decrements here improvements after four

641
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,798
weeks of treatment folks are going from

642
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,640
a 12.5 to a 13.4 that's a trend uh

643
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,558
that's that's that's pretty interesting

644
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,320
again you know alternate versions of

645
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,678
tasks are used so

646
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,439
we're not really thinking this is a

647
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,519
practice effect especially after four

648
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,120
weeks but certainly something to to

649
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,279
watch over time

650
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,719
i think that the expectation perhaps

651
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,558
when we introduce something that's

652
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,960
cannabis or cannabinoid-based is i'm

653
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,038
sure it's not necessarily going to make

654
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,720
people better i hear that a lot

655
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,400
and that's just not what we're seeing in

656
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,679
the case of this particular clinical

657
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,919
trial

658
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,440
so to conclude the cbd open label

659
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,759
clinical trial

660
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,200
data so far findings suggest that use of

661
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,359
this custom formulated whole

662
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,400
plant-derived high cbd sublingual

663
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,158
product results in less severe anxiety

664
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,159
as measured by the oasis and fewer

665
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,720
anxiety-related symptoms as measured by

666
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,440
the bai and the hama after four weeks of

667
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,880
treatment relative to their own baseline

668
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,640
self-reported improvements and other

669
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,480
mood symptoms like sleep and quality of

670
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,720
life were also noted which may be

671
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,360
related to reduced anxiety

672
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,360
it's funny these things often coexist so

673
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,678
it's hard to disentangle them i have

674
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,199
often noted that sleep disturbance tends

675
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,960
to happen in lots of different

676
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,558
conditions so

677
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,720
it's not surprising that when we see

678
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,119
sleep improvement we also see other

679
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
things improve and vice versa

680
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,399
improvements on tasks of executive

681
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,558
function were also noted we certainly

682
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,679
didn't see any worsening of task

683
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,079
performance which is really the

684
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,159
important issue here and no significant

685
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,879
adverse events or intoxication were

686
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,039
reported at all over the course of the

687
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,400
trial a definitive assessment of the

688
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,599
impact of this novel treatment will

689
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
certainly come

690
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,798
from the double-blind placebo-controlled

691
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,319
phase which is as i mentioned currently

692
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,480
underway and we have this additional

693
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,038
study arm that will now allow us to

694
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,278
compare the full spectrum product to a

695
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,200
matched cbd isolate which i'm very very

696
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,200
excited about

697
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,880
um one thing that i mentioned sort of in

698
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,278
passing is that we did monitor people

699
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,440
for thc positive status over the course

700
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,679
of the trial and the reason for that is

701
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,159
that many many people are taking what

702
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,320
they call quote cbd products they say oh

703
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,159
i'm just taking cbd uh what they really

704
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,240
mean is they're taking a product that's

705
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,039
either high in cbd or marketed as such

706
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,798
or contains cbd primarily hemp derived

707
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,240
products and the big question is am i

708
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,639
going to fail this random drug test

709
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,798
since i'm taking cbd which i think is a

710
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,000
great question

711
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,519
there have been very few studies that

712
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,240
have directly assessed whether the use

713
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,158
of a full spectrum high cbd product

714
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,558
could yield positive results on a

715
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,559
urinary drug test

716
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,319
and you know assessing cannabis use

717
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,319
through the detection of thc metabolites

718
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,639
it's really really important so we

719
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,960
monitored this status in this open label

720
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,200
trial and we used in-house or you know

721
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,240
in lab drug assays and we then confirmed

722
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,240
those data using gcms quantification in

723
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,759
pre versus post-treatment

724
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,240
we also looked at the relationships

725
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,079
between thc positive status and

726
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,319
demographic variables as well as things

727
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,079
like creatinine [ __ ] is typically

728
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,678
reflective of kidney function and

729
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,278
hydration

730
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,679
so after four weeks remember our final

731
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:08,798
sample was 14 not 15 folks we had to get

732
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,798
rid of one of them um exactly 50

733
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,599
of our subjects or our patients seven of

734
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:16,558
them were positive for thc metabolites

735
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,158
after the four weeks gcms confirmed the

736
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,759
assay findings but indicated that the

737
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,600
drug screen was actually more sensitive

738
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,798
than its stated lower limit of detection

739
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,158
that's probably because of some

740
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,720
cross-contamination from other

741
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,120
cannabinoids thc status was only

742
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,960
significantly associated with creatinine

743
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,038
there was no association with any other

744
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,319
demographic variable for example

745
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,480
bmi

746
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,038
there was also no association between

747
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,759
thc status and how much product people

748
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,679
actually took remember i mentioned that

749
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,599
we do bottle weights out and bottle

750
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,400
weights in and the actual amount was

751
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,480
somewhere around 35 migs of of cbd that

752
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,000
folks were getting every day not 30. so

753
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,679
you would think that people who had more

754
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,558
might have had a higher chance of

755
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,278
testing positive that wasn't the case so

756
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,960
it's not amount of product it's not bmi

757
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,640
it's not there any other demographic

758
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,000
variable the only relationship we saw

759
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,440
was with creatinine the measure of

760
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,960
hydration

761
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,278
patients consistently using full

762
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,960
spectrum hemp derived products then they

763
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,400
test positive for cannabis use on

764
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,120
urinary drug screens which is something

765
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,640
that people need to know

766
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,558
we definitely need studies with larger

767
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,480
sample sizes to more thoroughly assess

768
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:23,519
which variables like how much product

769
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,759
people are using bmi age sex race

770
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,440
other medication use for example

771
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,400
how those things contribute to positive

772
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,600
thc status in only some individuals

773
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,240
particularly those with higher

774
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,158
creatinine levels importantly and this

775
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,480
is something i can't stress enough this

776
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,039
study product if you look at the math

777
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,759
contained

778
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:46,319
0.02 let me say that again

779
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:48,558
0.02 percent thc by weight remember that

780
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,558
hemp derived products can contain up to

781
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:54,000
that's right 0.3

782
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,319
thc by weight that's more than 10 times

783
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,079
the amount of thc as in my current study

784
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,158
product and half of my sample was

785
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,119
positive after four weeks of treatment

786
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,720
so

787
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,158
um it's often assumed that individuals

788
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,798
who are using hemp derived products will

789
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,520
be negative for thc but this may not be

790
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:09,119
true

791
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,000
especially if assays are more sensitive

792
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,519
than advertised or they're

793
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,798
being impacted by what i would call

794
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,720
cross-contamination from other

795
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,798
cannabinoids those assays are designed

796
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,679
to look at the thc metabolites but the

797
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,440
presence of others may in fact create a

798
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,880
little bit of a change

799
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,200
these findings certainly underscore the

800
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,520
potential for adverse consequences

801
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,519
uh loss of employment for example legal

802
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,519
or treatment ramifications despite the

803
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,359
legality of hemp derived products

804
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,759
they're legal but that doesn't mean you

805
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,119
won't test positive for thc depending on

806
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,879
what you're using

807
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,959
and if i had a dollar for every person

808
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,360
that said but i'm only using cbd and

809
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,679
they hold up this model and it's not cbd

810
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,678
it's a it's a broad spectrum product or

811
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,960
a full full spectrum product i've also

812
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,480
seen them turn positive with broad

813
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,399
spectrum products

814
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,880
uh we have a number of other ongoing

815
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,959
clinical trials at the mind program

816
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,360
um some of which are pending we have

817
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,679
inds received for pain

818
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,519
we were just approved for anxiety in

819
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,200
patients with glioblastoma and in

820
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,639
patients with bipolar disorder which is

821
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,319
very exciting

822
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,240
we have some ieds pending for

823
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:17,839
indications like sleep and so many more

824
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,839
what do i mean when i say many more

825
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,000
a number of a number of different

826
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,918
indications so the mind program will

827
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,599
continue to support a range of studies

828
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,600
that will generate ecologically valid

829
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,439
empirically sound data examine the

830
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,519
unique synergistic effects of cannabis

831
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,360
and its constituents to determine the

832
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,000
efficacy of cannabinoids for specific

833
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,519
conditions and disease states clarify

834
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,159
the overall impact of cannabinoid

835
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,759
treatment on physical and mental health

836
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,760
invest in studies designed to improve

837
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,919
patients overall well-being and assess

838
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,079
potential risk and harm as well as

839
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,600
patterns of misuse it's not all about

840
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,319
just the good we also have to look at

841
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,759
the potential quote bad or downside

842
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,519
ultimately we'd like to harness the

843
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,038
therapeutic potential while minimizing

844
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,879
risk and harm of cannabinoid-based

845
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,038
treatment and exposure

846
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,440
we need to overcome barriers and conduct

847
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,839
empirically sound research to draw clear

848
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,519
conclusions i always say it's not one

849
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,759
thing or the other it's the good the bad

850
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,839
and ultimately the truth

851
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:14,000
without vision we have no ability to

852
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,158
move forward so very often we're forced

853
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,798
to think outside the box in order to

854
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,000
move the field forward and with that i

855
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,038
would thank you for your time and

856
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,798
attention

857
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,558
acknowledge my extraordinary staff

858
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,000
without whom i could not

859
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,000
i couldn't do any of this work they are

860
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
the most dedicated people ever and i

861
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,240
would again wish you a wonderful rest of

862
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,240
your conference and be safe thank you

863
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,240
again
