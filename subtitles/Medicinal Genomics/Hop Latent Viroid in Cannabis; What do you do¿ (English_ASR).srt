2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:17,879
all right

3
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:19,858
well we've established the problem what

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,439
do we do about it so if you were a

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,859
grower and you you suspect that you have

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,300
an infected plant what are your options

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,800
right so there's there's many things

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,539
Growers can do I mean the first thing

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,980
they need to do for sure is confirm that

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,600
they've got population

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,399
so whatever plant they're dealing with

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,020
most likely it's a flowering plant

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,120
because that's usually when you see it

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,559
and they send it off for testing the

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,780
first thing would be to work backwards

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,759
and try to figure out where did where

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,439
did I get my my clones from from for

18
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,539
that particular plant or that particular

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,218
genotype what did I did I grow it

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,039
indoors did I purchase it from someone

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,539
else or did I start it from seed uh and

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,679
once you've sort of worked backwards you

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,140
can say to yourself all right let's

24
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,659
assume it came from clones within your

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,019
own facility that means the mother plant

26
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,459
definitely has Heartland so you work

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,260
backwards you then test your mother

28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,579
plants uh depending on how big they are

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,859
and so on we can we can talk about

30
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,900
sampling strategies but you test your

31
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,879
mother plant and obviously if the mother

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,978
plant is infected

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,420
um the bad news is that I would say it's

34
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:20,579
got to be it's got to be thrown away

35
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,500
you've got to get rid of it

36
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,978
um there's really no proven ways right

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,780
now to to rescue a plant that has hot

38
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,938
latent in it I mean we've talked about

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,000
Mary stem culture and tissue culture and

40
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:36,059
so on it's possible but it hasn't been

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,280
demonstrated uh on a high level on a

42
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,500
high scale that you can you can rescue a

43
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,420
multiplied that's called public

44
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,680
so if you've proven that it's your

45
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,000
mother plan then obviously you get rid

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,979
of that

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,118
um the other possibility is that it

48
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:49,618
picked it up

49
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,078
um when the plant was in veg so let's

50
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,819
say you're vegging on the table and if

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,978
you're using Hydroponics then you've got

52
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,559
water or nutrient solution moving

53
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,719
between plants uh We've shown and others

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,840
have shown that it can't move with water

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,640
with recirculating water and so a veg

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,039
plant that's that's maybe two weeks old

57
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,500
could potentially have picked up hot

58
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,479
latent through the root system and and

59
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,459
the viral that makes its way into the

60
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,500
plant that way and then of course the

61
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,479
last alternative is a seed if you

62
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,120
started from seed you then test the

63
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,119
plant that came off the seed it could be

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,640
that that that gave rise to your

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,159
infected flowering plant

66
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,799
so it's it's a it's a detective sort of

67
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,900
a detective process or you know a

68
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,760
process of elimination deciding where

69
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,280
where did it come from you need to know

70
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,139
that that's number one

71
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,400
yeah and I think you kind of answered my

72
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,318
next question but I think it's a good

73
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,360
good thing to hammer home there really

74
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:49,378
doesn't seem to be any sort of treatment

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,000
or kind of remediation options available

76
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,620
yet right

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,180
yeah if you've got a heavy heavy

78
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,500
infected or even an infected mother

79
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,120
plant

80
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,280
um now you know people have tried and

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,019
people are trying taking cuttings from

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,219
different parts of the of the Big Planet

83
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,840
so you could you could definitely do

84
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,280
that you could take them from the top

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,259
they're actively growing you could take

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,699
it from the side the bottom but then you

87
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,699
have to go through and test all of those

88
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,679
to see if by chance and really it is a

89
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,259
chance if by a chance you are able to

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,480
get a clone that was free of of Health

91
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,359
label you know when the viral gets in

92
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,158
and we can discuss this now the first

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,980
place it goes is down into the roots

94
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,899
right so let's say let's say I infected

95
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,018
it through a cutting I went with my

96
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,539
tools and I transferred some sap onto a

97
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,980
cut surface and the first place that

98
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:36,419
goes is down into the roots and that

99
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,119
takes about two weeks

100
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,619
so let's say two weeks after uh it was

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,780
introduced it goes down into the roots

102
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,819
and then from The Roots it's moved

103
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,459
upward and the reason it's moved upward

104
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:49,859
is it it sort of follows the flow of of

105
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,140
sugar start sugars that are being

106
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,540
produced by photosynthesis in the plant

107
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,219
and that usually is towards the actively

108
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:58,079
growing shoots which are the young

109
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,419
shoots so you'll find it in the young

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,060
shoots probably around four weeks after

111
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,619
that initial infection occurred and then

112
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,140
it starts moving around the planet so

113
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,420
let's say by by six weeks it's now

114
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,039
pretty much everywhere but there are

115
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,738
cases where you know a branch gets

116
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,900
missed you've got a disease plan and all

117
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,939
of a sudden you know a healthy branch on

118
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,500
one side and I think I have a photo uh

119
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,180
in the presentation we can come back to

120
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,680
it in a second for some reason that

121
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,379
Branch got missed if you're lucky enough

122
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,819
you can get a cutting out of that a

123
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,279
clone out of that and you may have

124
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,279
escaped uh populate a distance in that

125
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,198
particular in that particular plant

126
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,698
um so it's not a uniform distribution

127
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,680
throughout it so

128
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,319
some producers will go through and take

129
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,240
clones from various parts of the of the

130
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,120
mother plant in the hopes that they can

131
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,418
find a few that don't have the uh the

132
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,418
thyroid

133
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:02,180
