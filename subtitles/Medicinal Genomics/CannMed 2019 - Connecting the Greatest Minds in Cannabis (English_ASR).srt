00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:11,189
Kennedy was fantastic this year can med

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:13,349
conference is great because many

3
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,660
different doctors researchers scientists

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,129
people coming from all different parts

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,390
of the cannabis industry are coming

6
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:20,390
together and sharing knowledge

7
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:27,050
so I think it's it's really turned into

8
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:36,170
a forum that is credible but also

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:38,780
diverse can med is a great way to help

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,980
me educate myself on current trends and

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,980
topics and cannabis research

12
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:50,149
can man plays a huge role in advancing

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:54,050
not only my workplace but medical

14
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:56,679
cannabis as an entity but more

15
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:58,699
importantly I think a lot of us ended up

16
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,590
realizing that we're all heading in the

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,359
same direction we're doing it in

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,790
different ways but they're mutually

19
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,150
supportive and I don't think there could

20
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:11,360
be you you can't overvalue just having a

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,520
little bit of camaraderie and scientific

22
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,420
recognition among peers when there

23
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,420
really isn't a lot of that
