1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,199
hi everyone and welcome my name is Jenny

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,759
Glaros and I am the CSO at modern can

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:17,719
labs which is a third-party testing

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,600
laboratory located here in Florida today

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,079
I want to talk to you about a topic that

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,320
I am very passionate about from the lab

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,879
testing side of things because I think

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,198
it is very important for what we do in

9
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:32,359
the industry and also very important for

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,439
cultivators to be able to understand

11
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,799
moisture content so if you're a

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,599
cultivator you're a grower um you're a

13
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:43,439
lab a lot of labs are reporting anywhere

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,840
from 12 to 15% moisture in flour and a

15
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:50,198
study we have conducted has proved that

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,879
this may not be a true representation of

17
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:55,159
water content in

18
00:00:51,878 --> 00:01:00,159
cannabis so let's Dive Right In what is

19
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:03,479
moisture so the FDA usfs no OAA if and

20
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,599
EPA all Define moisture as the water

21
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,319
content that is present in a sample so

22
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:12,039
looking solely at Water how much water

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:15,319
is there cannabis creates some

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,000
difficulty because it is volatile has

25
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,478
lots of volatile and semivolatile

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,799
compounds so we have cannabinoids we

27
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:24,719
have Turpin we have flavonoids we have a

28
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,439
lot of other compounds present that may

29
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,719
or may not be factored into those

30
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,798
moisture calculations depending on how

31
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,118
you're analyzing for moisture

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,040
moisture so this is kind of where our

33
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,000
study originated from so aoac is an

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,840
organization that's a standard

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,719
organization and they are in the process

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,520
of creating a cannabis PT and with this

37
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,718
cannabis PT and hemp PT it's a real life

38
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,599
sample so a lot of the pts on the market

39
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,039
you have to do manipulation of them you

40
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,118
have to change them you don't follow

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,920
your standard protocol this is different

42
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:58,000
because it is a real life sample coming

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,280
in and you process it as you would a

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,359
normal sample so with the AC pilot data

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,519
we saw that Labs reported moisture is

46
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:10,800
anywhere from 6% to 16% that is a pretty

47
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,239
drastic range and even the like average

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,400
rain looking at that three sigma data

49
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:19,480
ranges from about 9% to almost 14%

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,640
that's still a really big range for

51
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:25,318
something that should be the same sample

52
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:28,199
so the question is why and how is that

53
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,919
happening before we talk about the

54
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,958
different techniques for analyzing for

55
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,598
moisture I want to paint a picture for

56
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,878
why it's important to understand water

57
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:39,238
content and what the impact is of

58
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,919
varying moisture results so here I have

59
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,400
a table that's going to show you various

60
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,679
analytes and the impact that moisture

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,519
and dry weight correction has on those

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,920
results so when we look at something

63
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,959
like total THC we see we have an asre

64
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,479
received value of 20% that's what the

65
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,319
lab tested it as if they dry weight

66
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:00,158
correct that to 5% that number goes up

67
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:03,639
to 21 then to 7% that number number goes

68
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,439
up to 21.5 and then if they go to 15%

69
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,919
that number is suddenly

70
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:12,000
23.5 so as a cultivator or producer you

71
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,878
of course want that 15% moisture because

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,400
you're going to get a higher THC however

73
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,280
is this an accurate representation we

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,319
see the same thing happening with tpin

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,039
where an as received tarpine value may

76
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:27,438
be 1.5% and by time you dry weight

77
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:30,479
correct that to 15% you're now seeing

78
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:31,959
1.76% moisture we we also have some

79
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,359
contaminants listed here and

80
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,719
contaminants kind of are the

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,080
double-edged sword of moisture

82
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,280
Corrections right so if we're looking at

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,120
arsenic um in Florida the regulatory

84
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,318
limit for arsenic is 200 ppb so in this

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,719
sample lab received and had an as

86
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:51,479
received value of 180 ppb so when they

87
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,878
dry weight correct that to 15% moisture

88
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,598
that value is now 212 so now a producer

89
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,120
is failing so we really need to

90
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:01,280
understand an accurate moisture content

91
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,280
in order to get an accurate reported

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,919
value for producers Growers on what

93
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,840
their sample actually would be we also

94
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,798
have a pesticide example here seeing the

95
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,759
same thing that regulatory limit is

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,759
3,000 ppb so we see that if that as

97
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:20,000
received sample came in at 2700 it's

98
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,439
failing if the lab is reporting a 15%

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,439
moisture so how can you analyze for

100
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,399
moisture well there's a variety of

101
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,399
techniques in the industry and I've

102
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,638
included five of the main techniques

103
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,359
here so first we have Carl Fisher then

104
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,319
we have vacuum oven vacuum desiccation

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
loss on drying at high temperature and

106
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,319
loss on drying at low temperature in the

107
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,799
next few slides we're going to cover all

108
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,879
of these and give you a little bit of a

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,759
deeper explanation of how each of them

110
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,240
are done first up we have Carl Fisher

111
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,879
titration and this is the gold standard

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,240
of Botanicals and agricultural agents

113
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,759
but it's difficult to do so what labs

114
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,079
are doing is they're performing a

115
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,680
titration on the sample in order to

116
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,319
determine the amount of water that's

117
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,600
present based on a reaction that occurs

118
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,399
what's really nice about Carl Fisher is

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,240
because you're looking only at water

120
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,359
molecules and the reaction of water

121
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,639
molecules it prevents any of those

122
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,000
volatile and semivolatile compounds from

123
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,000
being factored into the moisture

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,720
calculation however one of the big

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,639
downsides is it can be very expensive

126
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,440
for Laboratories to utilize a caral

127
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,879
Fisher instrument can cost anywhere from

128
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:28,199
about $50,000 to $775,000 and then you

129
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,279
have consumables that go with that so

130
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,400
Laboratories who are trying to make

131
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,198
money chances are this is not a

132
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,679
technique that they're going to be able

133
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,319
to use and still make money and profits

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,439
on their samples we then have vacuum

135
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,120
oven and this is where uh this is

136
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,000
actually from the European pharmacopia

137
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,519
and basically the sample is placed in an

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,680
oven at a low temperature in this

139
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,318
instance 40° C under vacuum for an

140
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,759
extended time period to slowly evaporate

141
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,280
all of the water from the sample and

142
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,280
with this we limit the loss of volatile

143
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,559
and semivolatile compounds because we're

144
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,359
not heating it to a high temperature

145
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,478
however some of the negatives of this

146
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,080
are that the method does need to run for

147
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,598
24 hours which can decrease the lab's

148
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,719
throughput depending on the size of the

149
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,399
vacuum oven that they're utilizing if

150
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,479
they can only fit so many samples and

151
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,359
they have reruns it can affect their

152
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:22,240
turnaround times then we have vacuum

153
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,960
desiccation so this is similar to the

154
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,560
vacuum oven except for the fact that

155
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,159
we're keeping things at room temperature

156
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,839
and we're utilizing desicant to help dry

157
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,919
it out so a vacuum pump and a desicator

158
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,799
with absorbent desin in the bottom you

159
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,519
then place your sample in there and you

160
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,280
suck off all of the water um this is

161
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,159
great because it prevents all of the

162
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,719
loss of those volatile and semivolatile

163
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,400
compounds by keeping it at room

164
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,639
temperature or theoretically should help

165
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:51,079
limit it the most um however since that

166
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,360
sample is not heated there is a chance

167
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,719
that some of this water that's trapped

168
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,720
is not going to be fully removed so we

169
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,360
need to take that into consideration as

170
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,919
well then we have loss drying at high

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,960
temperature and this is pretty much the

172
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:06,878
universal standard of what Laboratories

173
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,239
are using most Laboratories in the

174
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,560
industry are using a loss on drying at

175
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,560
high temperature and what they're doing

176
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,639
here is they're heating a sample to a

177
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,839
high temperature normally above 103° C

178
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,759
to remove the water granted you see Labs

179
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,279
that heat anywhere from 103 to 150 and

180
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,879
that can impact those results the higher

181
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,519
the temperature the more the volatiles

182
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,800
you cook off so we need to understand

183
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,680
that impact and this is an effective way

184
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,439
to do moisture because you're ensuring

185
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,160
all of the water is being removed water

186
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,719
boils at 100° C and it's a quick process

187
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,120
however this temperature utilized is

188
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,280
drastically impacting those semivolatile

189
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,158
and volatile compounds that we know are

190
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,559
so prevalent in

191
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,478
cannabis then we have loss on drying at

192
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,439
low temperature and what this does is

193
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,158
it's very similar to that loss on drying

194
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,639
at high temperature except we're

195
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:57,639
limiting the temperature at what we're

196
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,079
heating the sample and in this instance

197
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,639
80° C and the reason for that is that we

198
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:06,560
know cannaboids start to decarbox at

199
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,199
about 85° once they've sat for a certain

200
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,519
period of time so we can prevent that

201
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,240
decarbox of canabo by doing this it is a

202
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,318
quick process so that's nice for

203
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,598
Laboratories and most of the water

204
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,080
should be evaporated at ADC however this

205
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,000
temperature does lead to some loss of

206
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,719
volatile and semivolatile compounds

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,399
because those tpin if you smell them in

208
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,240
the air it's because they're

209
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,519
volatilizing so at 80° you're definitely

210
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,560
going to start volatilizing those so

211
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,839
what did we want to do to compare all of

212
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,359
these methods and ultimately we wanted

213
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,680
to design an experiment that was able to

214
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,320
assess all of these Methods at once on

215
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,079
the same samples at the same time this

216
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,480
has been a really big complaint for the

217
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,600
industry is that when you're doing this

218
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,759
oh well you analyze Carl fiser on day

219
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,079
one but you analyzed loss on drying at

220
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,559
day five the moisture changes from day

221
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:02,679
to day so how is this comparative and

222
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,799
that's ultimately what we wanted to

223
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,679
eliminate we wanted a true comparative

224
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,039
study of samples the same day the same

225
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,599
time analyzed across all five of these

226
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,199
methods so the goal was to analyze at

227
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,440
least 100 samples we ended up with 120

228
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,278
samples total for this experiment and we

229
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,279
analyzed them via all five of those

230
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,039
moisture techniques so Carl Fisher which

231
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:27,039
was the oven was at 100° vacuum oven the

232
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,559
oven was at 40 degrees vacuum desig at

233
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,360
room temperature so 22 degrees Celsius

234
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,439
loss on drying at high temperature at

235
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,240
103° C and loss on drying at low

236
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,240
temperature 80° C we also wanted to run

237
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,360
each of the methods nine times in order

238
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,440
to get a comparison to measure the

239
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
reproducibility and variance from method

240
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,800
to Method one of the complaints we've

241
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,759
heard in the industry is that some of

242
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,000
these methods you run them and your

243
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,078
results change drastically from run to

244
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,639
run across the same sample so we wanted

245
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,000
to see are there any concerns for that

246
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,039
and finally the really big part of this

247
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,559
study was that we wanted to process a

248
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,759
subset of the samples for cannabinoids

249
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,479
and tpes pre and postanalysis to

250
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,278
understand what is happening to the

251
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,480
product when you're drying it in these

252
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,679
manners what decarbox silation is

253
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,680
occurring what turpine loss is occurring

254
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,838
and that's really the big overarching

255
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:22,239
goal was to truly understand what was

256
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,320
happening to the chemical makeup of

257
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,720
these

258
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,879
samples so first up I'm just going to

259
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,879
show some brief moisture comparisons

260
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:32,000
these are just uh we're going to have

261
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,399
three slides of these I chose 45 of the

262
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,078
120 samples and whenever you're looking

263
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,078
at this you can see that those three

264
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,838
bars that are about the same are going

265
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,439
to be the loss on drying at low

266
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,399
temperature the vacuum oven and the

267
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,720
caral Fisher and for these across all

268
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,360
120 samples we saw an average moisture

269
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,120
for and these are all dried cured

270
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,440
cannabis it should all be fairly similar

271
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,879
um so when these arrived we saw a

272
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,160
average moisture content across all

273
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,720
120 with the loss on drying at low

274
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:09,159
temperature of 7.4% moisture the vacuum

275
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,240
oven we saw 7.7% moisture and the Carl

276
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,919
Fisher we saw 7.3% moisture so that's

277
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,839
pretty impactful because across all

278
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,639
threes of these methods we're seeing

279
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,760
very similar moistures well within a

280
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,480
percent of each other however when we're

281
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,559
looking at the other types of testing so

282
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,560
the vacuum desiccation is yielding an

283
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,799
average overall moisture of about 4% and

284
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,958
the loss on drying at High tempure is

285
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,078
yielding an overall average moisture of

286
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,638
about

287
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:38,278
12.5% so this is a pretty big variance

288
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,240
so what is happening and why is this

289
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:43,399
happening before we look at a sample

290
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,360
through the entire process comparing

291
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,839
decarbox silation and Turpin I wanted to

292
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
do a quick review of the reproducibility

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,440
here so you can see the reproducibility

294
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,120
study yielded that all of these methods

295
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,079
really are reproducible within

296
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,600
themselves Labs if they're running them

297
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:58,719
should be able to get reproducible

298
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,639
results we have standard deviations well

299
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,839
within the expect expected range of what

300
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,879
a lab should be

301
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
validating so what are our initial

302
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,600
takeaways our initial takeaways from

303
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,399
this are that the vacuum oven the caral

304
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,639
Fisher and the loss on drying at low

305
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,919
temperature methods all yielded results

306
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,759
that are similar the vacuum desiccation

307
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,278
results appeared to be skewed slightly

308
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,480
low about 2 to 3% compared to the other

309
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,679
three methods that were uniform with one

310
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,000
another and then loss on dry at high

311
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,519
temperature results appeared to be

312
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,240
skewed High about 4 to 5% compared to

313
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,759
those three methods yielding the similar

314
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,278
data there was also no specific pattern

315
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,240
uh amongst those three similar methods

316
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,039
of which resulted in a higher or a lower

317
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,120
moisture so we weren't seeing a trend

318
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,000
where Carl Fisher was always the lowest

319
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,519
or vacuum desiccate or vacuum oven was

320
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,198
always the highest so it did fluctuate

321
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,720
and I think that that is going to be

322
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:53,159
very well explained in the next several

323
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,399
slides when we talk about decarb

324
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,039
oxolation and tarpine loss and then at

325
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,799
the end of course all of those methods

326
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,399
produce data that is reproducible

327
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,240
against itself which indicates that a

328
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,240
laboratory should be able to get

329
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,799
consistent results internally if using

330
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,240
any of these methods so there shouldn't

331
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,120
be this conversation of oh I used loss

332
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,440
on drying at high temp and one of my

333
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,839
samples was 10% and one of my samples

334
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,680
was 15% that's not what we should be

335
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,079
seeing if people are processing these

336
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,319
methods

337
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,198
correctly so let's do this full

338
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,399
comparison for an individual samples so

339
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:29,679
we are about to go very data heavy um so

340
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,440
just bear with me here

341
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,439
so first up we have the cannabinoid

342
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,199
decarbox silation so what I have in this

343
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,399
image is a zoomed in image looking at

344
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:39,759
Delta 9 and thca and I have an overlay

345
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,159
of all of these methods and I've

346
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,879
attempted to color code them so

347
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,240
hopefully you can tell the difference in

348
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,679
the colors here but what we can see in

349
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,198
the table below as well is we have the

350
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,439
OG which is going to be our as received

351
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,559
so that's a sample as it came in

352
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,240
analyzed it didn't manipulate it in any

353
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,958
manner and we saw that the thca was

354
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,839
20.5% and the Delta 9 was about 4% so

355
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,919
then we ran all of our different methods

356
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,040
and we looked at what those percentages

357
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,559
would be of the thca and the Delta 9 and

358
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:11,399
you can see here that that vacuum

359
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,838
desiccation sample really didn't change

360
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:18,519
much we still have

361
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:20,160
20.3% uh thca and about 0.5% um Delta 9

362
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,000
the loss on drying sample though that's

363
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,879
a little concerning that's at pink Peak

364
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
so when we're loss on drying that sample

365
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,159
at a high temperature of 103 we are

366
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,078
almost completely decarboxylating it so

367
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,198
you can see there that we now only have

368
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,799
about

369
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,120
27%

370
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,439
thca and now we have

371
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,360
17.4% Delta 9 UM loss on drying at low

372
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,639
temperature had minimal um degradation

373
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
and decarbox silation of the

374
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,159
cannabinoids similar to the vacuum oven

375
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,360
interestingly enough Carl fiser did see

376
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,159
more decarbox silation however what we

377
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,320
know about Carl Fischer is that it's

378
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,399
only looking at water molecules so

379
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,000
theoretically even though this decarbox

380
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,720
silation is occurring it should

381
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,198
shouldn't be factored into that moisture

382
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,240
calculation and that is why we're seeing

383
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,319
a similar result between that loss on

384
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,079
drying at low temperature the vacuum

385
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,240
oven and the caral Fisher because that

386
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,879
decarbox silation is not being factored

387
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,480
in on the next several slides we're

388
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,320
going to review the total percent

389
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,039
decarbox silation and so in order to

390
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,240
calculate that we looked at the actual

391
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,439
decarbox silation divided by the

392
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,480
theoretical decarbox silation multiplied

393
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,320
by 100 and that theoretical decarbox

394
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,639
silation was calculated based on what

395
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,920
that as received sample would be if it

396
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,039
fully

397
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,439
decarbox so you can see here the vacuum

398
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,719
desiccation sample this is a

399
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,800
chromatogram at what we refer to as a 1x

400
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,399
so our standard prep so do not be

401
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,958
alarmed of how big that thca Peak is we

402
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,879
are definitely not quantifying off of

403
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,399
that we run a second dilution but I

404
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,240
wanted you to be able to see the big

405
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,198
picture and also be able to see those

406
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,600
minor cannabinoids and how they're

407
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:54,719
impacted so what we're looking at is a

408
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,480
pretty similar chromatogram between the

409
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,278
as received in the vacuum desiccation

410
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,920
we're not really seeing much of a change

411
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:03,159
here we are seeing that THC Peak drop a

412
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,799
little bit and the Delta 9 Peak increase

413
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,519
a little bit but overall these

414
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,958
chromatograms are very similar we then

415
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,879
go to the loss on drwing at high

416
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,638
temperature we're not looking at a

417
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,639
similar chromatogram this chromatogram

418
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,959
is now very very different in addition

419
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,240
to having the thca PE Peak be almost

420
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:23,159
non-existent and the Delta 9 Peak being

421
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,959
huge we also have CBN being formed so we

422
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,919
know that Delta 9 as it breaks down it

423
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,679
forms CBN so we also have other decarbox

424
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,679
silation products occur occurring the

425
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:36,519
cbga in this sample also decarbox into

426
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:39,159
CBG loss on drying at low temperature

427
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,799
very similar to what we were seeing um

428
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:43,799
with the L on dry or the vacuum

429
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:45,838
desiccation sample where we're not

430
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,159
seeing too much decarbox silation but

431
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,800
some I also have those total decarbox

432
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,240
silation percentages on the bottom of

433
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,879
each of these

434
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,000
slides the ased um versus the vacuum

435
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,439
oven again very similar to what we're

436
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,318
seeing so we can tell from these methods

437
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,519
that we're seeing limited decarbox

438
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:05,798
silation across those three methods so

439
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,120
the vacuum desiccation the vacuum oven

440
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,318
and the loss on drying at low

441
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,838
temperature we get to the Carl Fisher

442
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,438
and we see a little bit more decarbox

443
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:15,639
silation occurring so this one we saw

444
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,160
about 37% decarbox silation um so not

445
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,199
anywhere near what we were seeing on

446
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,519
that loss on drying at high temperature

447
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,318
but some the sample is being manipulated

448
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,720
in some ways there is being a chemical

449
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:25,720
change

450
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,519
occurring so next we wanted to look at

451
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,240
tpine loss and wanted to understand what

452
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:34,918
that impact may be on the samples as

453
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,919
well so we analyzed for Tarpin again the

454
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,919
very similar procedure where we looked

455
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,720
at the you know original ased tpine

456
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,840
content and then we measured the tpine

457
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,480
content after analyzing via each of

458
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,119
these methods and what we can see here

459
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,480
is that we started out in this sample

460
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:53,279
specifically with about 1.6% tpin the

461
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,319
vacuum desiccation sample resulted in uh

462
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,960
having a remaining turbines of about 87

463
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,359
the loss on drying at high temperature

464
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,798
had absolutely no tpes left the loss on

465
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,399
drying at low temperature had about. 5%

466
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:09,400
the vacuum oven about 3% and the Carl

467
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,080
Fisher about 0.5% as well and similar to

468
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,360
what we did with the decarbox silation

469
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,918
we also want to look at the percent

470
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,558
tpine loss so how many Tarpin were lost

471
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,720
overall so that total tarpine lossi

472
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,918
divided by the total Tarpin as received

473
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,798
times 100 on each of these next slides

474
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,880
so here's the zoomed in chromatogram of

475
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,839
each of these and we're going to start

476
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,159
with the as received versus the vacuum

477
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,079
desiccation and what you can see here is

478
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,440
the really big peak that looks the same

479
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,720
in each of these as our internal

480
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,840
standards so that is good that should be

481
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,720
there um but the rest of these analytes

482
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,759
we can see that a lot of these tpin are

483
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,720
starting to drop and starting to

484
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,119
disappear however one important thing to

485
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,159
notice is that the tpin in front of the

486
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,558
internal standard drop off more than the

487
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,120
turpins behind the internal standard and

488
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,839
that's based on the heaviness of those

489
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:58,079
tpin and the volid volatility of those

490
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,558
tpin so the higher the boiling point the

491
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,119
less they're boiling off in these

492
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:03,158
methods or the less they're coming off

493
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,000
in volatilizing and this one this is at

494
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,600
room temperature so it's all just

495
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,359
volatilizing based on that vacuum you

496
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,558
being

497
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,918
utilized whereas those lighter ones we

498
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,079
are seeing quite a bit of degradation

499
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,000
still we then looked at that loss on

500
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,639
drying sample at a high temperature

501
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,720
there's absolutely nothing remaining

502
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,440
there may be a little itty bitty baby uh

503
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,159
alphab Biz Biz aolo Peak but um

504
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,400
definitely below our detection limit for

505
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,320
quantifying so those results ended up

506
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
indicating ating that that was

507
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,720
Zero then we looked at the loss on

508
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,679
drying um at low temperature compared to

509
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,120
that as received and we saw something

510
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,400
similar to what we saw at the vacuum

511
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:43,359
desiccation but because we're adding

512
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,280
heat a lot of those early looting tpin

513
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,439
are almost completely gone which is what

514
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,158
you would expect you're adding heat at

515
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,038
80° in this and so those Tarpin are

516
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:54,880
saying bye we don't stay here anymore

517
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,759
and no longer in that

518
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,360
sample then we have the vacuum uh oven

519
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:03,119
sample and so this one's heated to 40°

520
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:04,959
and so we did surprisingly see more loss

521
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,918
in this than we did at that loss on

522
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,919
drying at low temperature and I think

523
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,640
that this can be explained by the amount

524
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,840
of time that it takes so the loss on

525
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,080
drying at low temperature that sample

526
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,399
only takes about 14 to 15 minutes to

527
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:19,359
analyze however this loss on drying

528
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,960
because you're doing or this vacuum oven

529
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,918
sample because you're doing 40° C you

530
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,279
have to leave it under vacuum for much

531
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,120
longer so those Tarpin are being pulled

532
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,960
off of the sample then we had the Fisher

533
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,879
sample which again it is experiencing

534
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,798
that loss to you are heating the sample

535
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,960
to 100° C however what we know about

536
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,960
Carl Fisher is that those values are not

537
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,960
going to be factored in unless water

538
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,279
molecules are being formed and I think

539
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,440
that's an additional part of this

540
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,319
investigation right is what water

541
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,360
molecules could be formed in any of

542
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,558
these caral Fisher extractions and could

543
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:56,519
that be impacting

544
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:59,000
things so as kind of a summary of this I

545
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,200
wanted to paint a picture for

546
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,640
understanding the total weight loss via

547
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,480
each of these methods so here we have

548
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,440
the moisture obtained by each method

549
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,599
along with the weight lost by decarbox

550
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,440
silation the weight loss by turbines and

551
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:16,519
the total weight loss this is exactly

552
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,679
how much what percentage of the weight

553
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,119
is lost via each of these methods so you

554
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,120
can see when you're running that vacuum

555
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:24,798
desiccation method you obtain a moisture

556
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,439
of about five close to 5% and we're

557
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,960
experiencing a total weight loss of

558
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,679
about 0.9%

559
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,240
um we then moved to that loss on drying

560
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,840
at high temperature yes we're getting a

561
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,839
moisture of 133% but the total weight

562
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:40,079
loss contributed to the decarboxylation

563
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:42,079
in tpin is over 4% so if you think about

564
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,720
samples where you have high tarpine

565
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,879
content and high THC content that number

566
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,919
could be even higher when we're talking

567
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,120
about that total weight loss we then

568
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,840
have the loss on drying at low

569
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,719
temperature sample we got 88.3% as our

570
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:58,678
moisture obtained and then we saw about

571
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,319
1.2% loss the vacuum oven we got 7% and

572
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:05,360
saw about 1.3% loss and then the Carl

573
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:07,278
Fisher we got 7.72 and saw about 2% loss

574
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,000
so interestingly the caral Fisher did

575
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:11,720
yield the second amount most amount of

576
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,640
loss yet its results still line up

577
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,360
really well with that loss on drying at

578
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,400
low temperature and the vacuum oven

579
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:21,158
which further indicates that the caral

580
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,440
Fisher is not factoring in anything but

581
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,320
those water

582
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,320
molecules so what are some of the

583
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,319
conclusions we were able to establish

584
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,158
from this study first is going to be

585
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,000
that there is significant decarbox

586
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,720
silation and loss of Tarpin with the

587
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,359
loss on drying at high temperature

588
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,519
method and so overall what we saw in

589
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,839
average across all of the samples that

590
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,400
we looked at for cannabinoids which

591
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,319
ended up being about 30 samples um we

592
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
saw that the loss on drying had an

593
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:49,359
average decarbox silation of

594
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,000
87% and had an average turpine loss of

595
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,678
93% so that is very impactful uh for

596
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,839
understanding those results then we had

597
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,880
the Carl Fisher and it did exhibit the

598
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:01,240
next largest amount of decarbox and

599
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,440
tarpine loss and so for that sample we

600
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,120
saw 37% decarbox silation on average

601
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,720
along with 69% turpine loss however

602
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,918
those results were not drastically

603
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:16,640
impacted by that which lends to the

604
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,640
understanding that the Caro Fisher is a

605
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,038
gold standard kind of method when

606
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,919
looking at something with a lot of

607
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:24,720
volatile compounds the vacuum dation

608
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:27,080
samples did experience the least amount

609
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,798
of decarbox silation and tarpine loss so

610
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:32,720
on average the decarbox ation was only

611
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:35,839
1.7% and the turpine loss was about

612
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,519
55% however there are concerns that

613
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,519
those samples are not being brought to

614
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,079
complete dryness because of some of that

615
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,879
water may be very well Bound in the

616
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,439
Cannabis and we're doing some additional

617
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,720
experiments with that where we're taking

618
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,480
the samples analyzing them using the

619
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,440
vacuum desiccation and then putting them

620
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,839
on the caral Fisher to see what it

621
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,840
indicates as far as what moisture may be

622
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,839
remaining in those samples and then

623
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,599
those that finally that loss on dry at

624
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,918
low temperature the caral Fisher and the

625
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,000
vacuum oven results are on average

626
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,919
within 1% of one another and I think

627
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,159
that this is really impactful for the

628
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,960
Cannabis industry um not only because

629
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,880
we're limiting the decarbox silation

630
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,159
we're limiting the turpine loss but it

631
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,039
also gives us a way to make method

632
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,840
recommendations for what people should

633
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:22,400
be utilizing in the industry and so

634
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,959
ultimately the final takeaways are that

635
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,200
Laboratories should be using something

636
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,600
like Carl Fisher the vacuum oven or the

637
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,440
loss on drying at low temperature when

638
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:34,158
looking at moisture content and based on

639
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,360
this study we are you know hypothesizing

640
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,679
that most cannabis flow is actually

641
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:42,959
around 7% moisture once it's finally

642
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:45,440
dried and cured versus the 12 to 15%

643
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,440
that most people are obtaining in

644
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,840
addition to this we have also done a

645
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,000
relationship study between uh water

646
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,398
activity and moisture to help understand

647
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,119
that and that correlation and I would

648
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:57,479
love to talk with you all about that

649
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,199
after if you have any additional

650
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,079
questions I'd love to share some of that

651
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,080
data and with that I would like to thank

652
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,960
a couple of people metrome um being one

653
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,759
of them metrome you gave us a Carl

654
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,600
Fisher to be able to utilize for this

655
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:14,079
study which was very very helpful as

656
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:17,158
well as aqualab by ADM they provided us

657
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:19,839
with a RW one which is a moisture

658
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,919
balance that does low temperature so 80°

659
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,199
and allows us to analyze nine samples at

660
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,159
a time which really helped us be able to

661
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,319
process all 120 samples and with that I

662
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,320
will take questions

663
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:37,568
[Applause]

664
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:47,679
thanks uh Jenny so it it it appears the

665
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,599
the drying technique here can alter the

666
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,720
canabo profile and um not necessarily

667
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:55,480
reflect what the patient's going to be

668
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,880
consuming um is there any motion toward

669
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,399
moving to sort of aerosolizing smoke and

670
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,520
measuring the actual inhalation products

671
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:04,678
because all of this stuff's going to get

672
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:07,519
decarbox anyway when someone decides to

673
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,919
you know light up a flower so uh it

674
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,639
seems like we're uh it seem we got a bit

675
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,440
of a struggle here where we've got raw

676
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,600
canabo content then you get rid of the

677
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,240
water content and if you overd dry it

678
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,599
some of the canabo change but at the end

679
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,720
of the day the patients never going to

680
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,918
see any of that they're going to see

681
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,600
pyrolytic uh canabo right so I think the

682
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,159
difference here is this is focusing a

683
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,319
lot on the moisture techniques that

684
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,679
Laboratories are utilizing so the with

685
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,720
this you know the Growers and the

686
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:34,278
cultivators are drying their flower in

687
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,919
much different ways they're not using

688
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:38,880
any of these techniques it's more of the

689
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,840
laboratory and how they are providing

690
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,919
data to the producers and Growers to

691
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:46,678
know how wet or how dry their flower is

692
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,038
when we talk about uh aerosol testing it

693
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,240
that's a whole another monster um that I

694
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,879
think still has a lot of Kinks to work

695
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:57,240
out before we see any labs doing it

696
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,200
successfully and doing it at a high

697
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,759
scale thank you for the presentation

698
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,519
have you ever considered freeze drying

699
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:07,798
so we did uh talk about freeze drying in

700
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,639
this um and thinking about how that may

701
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,679
impact it however for a laboratory

702
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,799
whenever we're analyzing it most of them

703
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,640
don't have freeze dry capabilities so

704
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,038
when we were thinking about this study

705
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,520
we wanted to really focus on what most

706
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,319
Laboratories could potentially use and

707
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:27,200
then of course what that gold standard

708
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:27,200
the Carl Fisher is

709
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,088
