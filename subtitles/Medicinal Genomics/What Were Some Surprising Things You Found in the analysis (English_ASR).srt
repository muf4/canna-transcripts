2
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,480
so what were some of the most surprising

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,479
things that you found in that

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:23,479
analysis I think that the first thing

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,759
that c our attention was that we

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,759
initially expected that the Y jeans to

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,439
show more specific expression in some in

8
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,119
samples from male

9
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:40,238
flowers but only a small proportion of

10
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:44,078
the genus on the white chromosome are

11
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:47,159
expressed exclusively in the male

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,399
flower while many other genes are

13
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,799
expressed in samples from other chesus

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,480
including those from female

15
00:00:52,799 --> 00:01:01,000
Bloods ER so searching about that uh I

16
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:04,599
see that this butter can be explained

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,680
by some researchers indicating that only

18
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:10,158
a small proportion of the white

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,280
chromosome is unique with the majority

20
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,799
being shared with the X

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,879
chromosome so uh but it's still a thing

22
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,320
that need more deep

23
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:28,280
attention um another notable finding was

24
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:32,438
uh the clustering of the Tricom samples

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,439
because as you know troms are where the

26
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:40,078
synthesis and storage of the medicinal

27
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:42,199
compounds are in the plant and we

28
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:46,039
observe that the triom

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,879
samples showed um very similar

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,439
expression profiles regardless of

31
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:55,679
chemotype indicating that it's likely

32
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,919
that only a small number of Genies that

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,920
differentiate these

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,240
chemotypes but again it's something that

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,960
need more deeper um

36
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,878
interpretations wow that's surprising so

37
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,919
so you're saying parts of the Y

38
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,519
chromosome can actually be found in

39
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:17,799
female

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:21,480
plants yeah a Genus provenance from the

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,480
the Y region also have expression in

42
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:31,759
other teur including in female um

43
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:31,759
cheeses in the case flowers interesting

44
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:45,959
