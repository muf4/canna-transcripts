1
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,718
okay hello i am keith allen from front

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,160
range biosciences i'm going to talk

3
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,439
about something that's a little bit

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,560
different from what was in my

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:22,079
abstract but you know time moves on and

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,799
sometimes the science moves on with it

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,278
so what i'm going to talk about is gene

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,080
families underlying oil content in

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,518
cannabis specifically the cannabinoid

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,159
synthase

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,519
family and the terpene synthase family

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,558
i'm going to talk about just a little

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,079
bit of

14
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,000
of stuff

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,399
with that so the

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,519
objectives of this talk we've been doing

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,200
a bunch of work in both of these areas

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
i'm going to share some recent results

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,600
on the structure

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,399
the expression and the evolution of the

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,800
cannabinoid synthase family and put this

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,520
into the context of the larger

23
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:02,238
berberine bridge enzyme family and take

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,359
a quick peek at variation in the terpene

25
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:08,239
synthase family so i want to start with

26
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,560
a paper that came out last year um

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,839
origin and evolution of the cannabinoid

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,400
oxido

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,118
gene family excellent paper by van

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,560
veldson and schranz

31
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,879
so the oxido cannabinoid oxido cyclase

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,719
gene family is

33
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,679
the berberine bridge

34
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,959
enzyme family these are these are oxido

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,720
cyclases this is evolutionarily it's a

36
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,039
very old family that makes a variety

37
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,000
of um uh

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,920
plant

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,319
uh secondary

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:48,478
metabolites that tend to be in the 2025

41
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:51,919
carbon range or about the size of

42
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:55,599
cannabinoids so what they did in this

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,000
paper that is uh so useful i think

44
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,559
is um they took advantage of the fact

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,840
that we now have complete genomes for

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,399
cannabis humulus trema and parasponia

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,439
uh which um

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,719
together are the are the uh canobaceae

49
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,318
clade depending on how you um define it

50
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,840
uh

51
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:22,639
so if you're looking for the origins of

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,039
the cannabinoid synthesis

53
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,679
it's reasonable to ask

54
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,639
did the expansion of this family

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,599
happen

56
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:35,439
in cannabis itself or did it happen

57
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:38,639
earlier perhaps in humulus maybe in

58
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,519
tremor or parasponia so what the authors

59
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,159
did

60
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,360
is they looked for synthetic

61
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:49,359
relationships and they were able to find

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,680
in cumulus and in the other two species

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,560
they were able to find the region of the

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,519
genome that gave rise

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,878
to the cannabis to the cannabinoid

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,759
synthase

67
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:05,359
pathway and follow this through

68
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:08,479
with the satanic relationships and then

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,280
uh see basically so what happened here

70
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,238
was

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,280
cannabis inherited

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,200
well this big berberine bridge enzyme

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,239
family but there was one gene in

74
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:23,839
particular that ended up going through a

75
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,319
series of duplications

76
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,640
in order it originally gave a founder

77
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,280
set of cannabinoid synthases and then

78
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,000
there were subsequent duplications

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,479
that produce the family structure

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,120
that we have now so that the really

81
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,479
interesting finding of this paper is

82
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,400
that

83
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,399
the cannabinoid synthases

84
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,680
did evolve within the species cannabis

85
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,519
um

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,680
itself

87
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,480
and that's kind of an interesting thing

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,599
um in and of itself so looking at

89
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,199
uh the berberine bridge enzyme family in

90
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,280
cannabis

91
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,318
so this is doing

92
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
what i did here was gene discovery on a

93
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,280
cs10 genome

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,039
the reference genome and what i'm doing

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
here is

96
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,199
the um

97
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,720
this the genes that already have a name

98
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,478
that are published in the literature so

99
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,120
thc cbd

100
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,399
synthase of the cbc uh synthases um they

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
get a name

102
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,519
everybody else gets a number and that

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,240
number is the percent identity

104
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,918
to the thc

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,639
synthase then i've used um

106
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,719
expression data libraries that were

107
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,400
published in the

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,080
break at all paper on the kanba 2

109
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,799
genome

110
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,359
this is a nice set of libraries because

111
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,600
they have trichome flower libraries then

112
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,400
female leaf male leaf

113
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,360
and roots so you can do a little bit of

114
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,560
of tissue specificity kinds of questions

115
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,439
so

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
um

117
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,240
what i'm

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,240
running here that the kamba 2

119
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,120
expression data this is from a type 2

120
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:20,000
plant so you've got more or less equal

121
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:23,120
expression of thc and cbd synthases

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
very little expression

123
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,879
of the rest of the cannabinoid

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,319
genes but you look across the rest of

125
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,478
this of the berberine bridge enzyme and

126
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,879
cambio2 is a little bit of an outlier

127
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,560
because you have stronger expression in

128
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,240
trichomes

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,639
of some of these particularly this this

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,639
one at 43.503

131
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,038
but pretty much across the board you see

132
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,160
pretty

133
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,079
healthy levels of expression of these

134
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,199
completely uncharacterized burning

135
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,198
bridge enzymes in trichomes but also

136
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,439
elsewhere

137
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,120
elsewhere in the plant you see big

138
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,439
differences between

139
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,000
female leaf and male leaf and you see

140
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,279
that most of these berberine bridge

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,360
enzymes are expressed in the roots

142
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,679
these are secondary plant metabolites

143
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,439
which are primarily about

144
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,439
communicating with the environment in

145
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,839
one way or another so it's interesting

146
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,120
to see what you know what they're doing

147
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,279
in roots

148
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,840
if you look at this one down here 88.398

149
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,239
it has pretty healthy expression in

150
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,279
cannabis trichomes i don't see much of

151
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,800
anything anyplace else it turns out

152
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,000
this gene

153
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,759
is

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,279
about

155
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,240
85 percent identical to cbdas 88

156
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,279
identical to thc as

157
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
it's

158
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:54,799
not full length um it's missing

159
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,399
um it's missing the start codon part of

160
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,680
the um

161
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,120
secretions

162
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,639
uh signal it doesn't go all the way to

163
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,439
the stop codon and it has several stop

164
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,918
mutations in it stop codons

165
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,918
in it it cannot make

166
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,439
a functional protein

167
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,478
it's a pseudogene

168
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,279
but it's highly expressed well or at

169
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,359
least

170
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,478
has fairly reasonable

171
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,479
amounts of expression

172
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,598
so on that topic of expression here i'm

173
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:28,560
looking

174
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,399
using

175
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,360
the expression data published by zager

176
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,198
at all so this is nine different

177
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,840
trichome libraries

178
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,400
um only one of these

179
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,598
cannot sue here is a is a type two and

180
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:48,000
you see um expressions split between thc

181
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,279
and cbd synthase

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,639
but basically that the two big guys

183
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,439
um

184
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
which

185
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,120
we never see these present in more than

186
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,720
one copy

187
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,800
but they tend to have i mean to really

188
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,120
dominate

189
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,759
expression

190
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,759
overall

191
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,280
you also see that this pseudogene

192
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,919
there's always a certain amount of

193
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:19,119
expression on this thing and in some

194
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,198
strains it's actually can be

195
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,038
quite high

196
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,960
i have no idea

197
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,199
what this thing is doing but pseudogenes

198
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,038
express pseudogenes frequently play

199
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,439
regulatory roles

200
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,718
um and so

201
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,440
it's something that will have to be

202
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,440
looked at uh more to figure out i just

203
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,120
throw this out as you know

204
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,200
something that i found along the way

205
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,278
that

206
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,158
could be playing an interesting role

207
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,278
here

208
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,039
i don't know at this point what that is

209
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,519
so

210
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,599
in thinking about the evolution of the

211
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
cannabinoid synthases

212
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,120
from trauma

213
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,959
humus cumulus and parasponia

214
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,679
sequences

215
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,879
what i've done here is i've done an

216
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,159
alignment

217
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,278
of

218
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,399
just the active site residues

219
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,159
um

220
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,000
this is determined from the crystal

221
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,439
structure and this is things that are

222
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,639
close enough that they can be

223
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,760
interacting with either the the fad

224
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:24,639
molecule that is covalently linked into

225
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,200
the active site of these enzymes or with

226
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:30,639
the substrate itself and in the case of

227
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,879
the cannabinoid synthesis that's cbga

228
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,399
or the the varen

229
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,759
equivalent of that so looking across the

230
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,639
active site

231
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,838
um

232
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,639
there's

233
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,839
a bunch of things that are um pretty

234
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:49,439
well um um conserved like a hundred

235
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,160
percent um um conserved and

236
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,959
you know 50 of the residues in this

237
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:59,120
alignment are 100 conserved but some of

238
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,000
these so hiss 114 sis 176

239
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,278
here

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,320
and here

241
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,439
these guys are covalently linked to the

242
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,200
fad

243
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,760
they're a hundred percent conserved all

244
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,920
the way out to trauma

245
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,639
some of the others here

246
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,719
this tyrosine 417

247
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,439
they propose

248
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,278
is and this is from the shoyama

249
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,680
at all this is the crystal structure

250
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:27,679
paper they propose that this is involved

251
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:30,879
in hydrogen bonding and his 292

252
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,958
is also involved in hydrogen bonding

253
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,200
of your cbga

254
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,359
substrate here

255
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,160
his 292

256
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,519
well

257
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:44,078
you know it's replaced by an arginine

258
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,120
in the out species that could play the

259
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,759
same

260
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,320
hydrogen bonding role

261
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,319
tyrosine 417

262
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,879
is a tyrosine and humulus it goes to a

263
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,879
phenylalanine

264
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,959
well that could be doing a pi bonding

265
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
role but it couldn't be doing the

266
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,039
hydrogen bonding rule

267
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,679
these are probably

268
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,759
well it's hard to say it's hard to say

269
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,838
what the specificity of an enzyme is

270
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,600
going to be just by looking

271
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,920
at the active site but that's kind of an

272
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,519
important difference the most important

273
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:22,240
thing tyrosine 484 here this is the

274
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,000
catalytic base that

275
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,879
rips off a proton and starts the

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,639
reaction that leads you

277
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:35,759
to your uh your final product tyrosine

278
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,399
484 right here is conserved all the way

279
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,958
out uh to trauma

280
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,958
and amparismonia

281
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:47,518
so to take this a little bit further now

282
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,879
looking at um

283
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,240
both of these plots are going to take a

284
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:56,559
little um a little explaining here but

285
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,320
looking at how the cannabis um genes

286
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,838
compare

287
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,680
to

288
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,720
trauma parasponia what i did here is i

289
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,039
took all of the cannabis genes and this

290
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,440
is the entire berberine bridge

291
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,399
family here and i compared them

292
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
to

293
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,320
trema

294
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,360
and i says what is the percent identity

295
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,600
of the top hit

296
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,120
in trauma and that's

297
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,000
on this axis here is similarity to

298
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,639
trauma and then i also compared all of

299
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,159
them to thc synthase

300
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:40,000
um and this is again percent um

301
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,759
identity to uh thc synthase so this guy

302
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,958
out here at 100

303
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:49,360
that is thc synthase down here that's

304
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,838
the cbd synthase these are um the

305
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,759
clade c

306
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,920
genes back up a step because i've

307
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,559
forgotten to tell you

308
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,319
a part in thinking about

309
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,239
the uh

310
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,920
this paper the other thing that the van

311
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,120
velsson paper did

312
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,078
is

313
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,078
um they came up with a nomenclature for

314
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,120
talking about

315
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,159
about

316
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,679
the entire clade structure so basically

317
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,039
um

318
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,479
thc

319
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:23,599
and cbd constitute their own clades

320
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,120
the cbc synthase uh

321
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,519
uh group constitutes its own clade

322
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,240
and then these guys at 88 percent that

323
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,039
gets called clade c i tend to call them

324
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,600
the 88s but clade c

325
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,360
is is a better name for those

326
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,278
so

327
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,399
this is clade c

328
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:47,439
these are the cbc synthases and they're

329
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,839
all at around 58

330
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,040
identical to their top hip these couple

331
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,000
of these it's at 60.

332
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:59,039
so what you see here is a basically the

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,600
more you look like thc synthase

334
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,759
the less you look like anything from

335
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,199
parasponia or trauma

336
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:10,078
or cumulus and some of these genes that

337
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,359
are down in the 45

338
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:12,319
identity

339
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,839
to

340
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,399
thc

341
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,519
these are really very similar

342
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,679
uh to their their counterparts um

343
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,278
uh in uh

344
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:28,799
in in in the out species so this kind of

345
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:30,720
drives home a little bit more the part

346
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,120
where

347
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,759
the evolution of this family really

348
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,879
happened in cannabis

349
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,838
in the cannabis species and so that's

350
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,480
why these guys are going completely off

351
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,000
on their own and are getting further and

352
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,440
further away

353
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
from um

354
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,160
you know from the genes that they um

355
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,278
originally evolved from

356
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,399
so the next step in this is looking at

357
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:00,958
the kinds of changes that have happened

358
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,759
going i'm not showing you the complete

359
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,719
alignment but basically taking this set

360
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,958
of sequences and now aligning

361
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,278
the full sequences these things are in

362
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:15,278
the range of 545 amino acids long

363
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,399
they're all pretty much the same

364
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,480
the same length so an alignment of of

365
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,440
all of these is a nice well-behaved

366
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,600
thing so i went through this and i

367
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,800
looked every time in the alignment there

368
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,399
was a change say a to s a

369
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:35,679
to phenylalanine a to leucine

370
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,958
any of those changes what i did was i

371
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,599
kept track i wrote some code to use a

372
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,679
substitution matrix the blossom 62

373
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,360
substitution matrix

374
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:49,919
to sign a severity score

375
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,879
basically how big of a change

376
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,919
was this blossom 62 if you run a blast

377
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,759
search

378
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,799
at ncbi by default blossom 62 for a

379
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,680
protein

380
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,159
search

381
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:05,838
that's the substitution matrix that gets

382
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:08,159
gets used and basically what blossom 62

383
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,480
does is it it tells you i mean exactly

384
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,679
what i'm looking for there

385
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,199
how serious of a change um has taken

386
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,159
place here so if we just look at random

387
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,838
you just

388
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:24,480
basically just take the whole matrix and

389
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,759
say what do all the changes look like

390
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,278
generally

391
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,839
a score of zero means you don't lose any

392
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:35,120
points in your alignment it doesn't hurt

393
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,519
you but most of the time

394
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,480
you get a negative score if you just a

395
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,159
random change in amino acid

396
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,000
usually

397
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,879
it's going to hurt you

398
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,159
in terms of similarity to the original

399
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,519
um

400
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:54,240
the original protein and conservation of

401
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,839
the function of that protein sometimes

402
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,560
some of these scores

403
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,519
you know you can get a positive score

404
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,679
for a mis mismatch um leucine to

405
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,120
isoleucine um

406
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,038
for example

407
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,918
but usually

408
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,318
it hurts you now looking at

409
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,120
the berberine bridge enzyme family

410
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,639
including the out species and looking at

411
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,159
all the changes that happen there a

412
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,679
substantial shift

413
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,919
toward more positive scores that happens

414
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,919
here and in fact doing kolmograph

415
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,759
smirnoff test with the

416
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,759
standard test to compare two

417
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,200
distributions like this

418
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:37,919
i get a p-value on this of you know 2 to

419
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,440
the minus 16th which is tells me that

420
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,960
these are definitely different

421
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,558
distributions

422
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,919
what this tells us is that the evolution

423
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:51,038
of the family happening in cannabis

424
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,280
took place under selective pressure

425
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:56,319
that's the only way you can get

426
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,558
a departure from random

427
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,439
like what we're seeing here is if there

428
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,639
has been some kind of pressure on on

429
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
this

430
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,840
to push it that way

431
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,679
i think that's pretty interesting we've

432
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,279
suspected this for a long time but it's

433
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,400
nice to have it

434
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,519
actually

435
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,200
actually demonstrated and let me think i

436
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,960
think this is almost last thing i'm

437
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,558
going to tell you about the cannabinoid

438
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:24,400
synthesis um i went in

439
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,519
and i looked at the promoter regions

440
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,200
um

441
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:34,558
i used um uh the the meme suite um

442
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,400
to go in and then then i use there's a

443
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:41,599
a database of um arabidopsis

444
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,240
transcription factor binding

445
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,599
that have been experimentally

446
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,960
determined

447
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:51,918
and so i used the arabidopsis database

448
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,200
and went in it was a two-step process

449
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,600
to

450
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,880
map binding sites

451
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,599
within the promoters and you get a ton

452
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,760
of binding sites and i assume that a lot

453
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:08,399
of those are false positives and then

454
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:10,558
the second step is to go in and ask for

455
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,798
which binding sites occur more

456
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,119
frequently than you would expect

457
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,960
at random and that's that's what i'm i'm

458
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,479
showing here and so i'm showing you

459
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,880
examples of so the thc synthase and it's

460
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,000
you know from the start codon here at

461
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,520
zero to minus a thousand thousand bases

462
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
um

463
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,400
upstream and i'm showing it to you from

464
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,679
three different um genomes here and

465
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,038
basically

466
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,559
all the thc synthases look very similar

467
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,759
all the cbd synthases look very similar

468
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,599
but

469
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,079
they look different

470
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,199
from the thc synthase again the same

471
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,480
thing with cbc synthases there are some

472
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,480
differences

473
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,679
that you'll see but it's a different

474
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,759
picture

475
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,200
than the other two and again for the

476
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,480
clade c

477
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,720
so

478
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,000
this doesn't tell us a lot directly

479
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,440
about exactly how are these guys

480
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,480
regulated

481
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,679
but it does tell us that there are

482
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,319
that these guys are going to

483
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,600
respond differently

484
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,119
to

485
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,079
the regulatory environment because

486
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,479
they've got different different sets of

487
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,439
of binding sites in their promoters now

488
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,558
speaking of that regulatory environment

489
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,038
i just went in and i pulled out

490
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,319
a bunch of cannabis transcription

491
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,480
factors

492
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,599
and this was by similarity to a set of

493
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,798
arabidopsis transcription factors

494
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,359
um

495
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,319
i've now used um

496
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,158
both

497
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:49,519
the um the zager trichome libraries and

498
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,880
a set another set of five libraries

499
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,879
from judith booth at all and a little

500
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,000
bit more recent paper so i'm looking

501
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,720
across 14 different

502
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
trichome

503
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,639
mrna uh

504
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,519
data sets here

505
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,440
and

506
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,599
and then each of these genes i'm just

507
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,120
giving it um

508
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,439
whatever in my mouse i'm just giving it

509
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,079
the name of the top blast head i don't

510
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,038
actually know that much about

511
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,038
what these are so if you look at the

512
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,038
variation that's that's happening here i

513
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,798
mean basically

514
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,798
ah it doesn't look like there's that

515
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,599
much consistency going on but you need

516
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:32,558
to remember that rna-seq is kind of a

517
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,439
blunt instrument

518
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:38,720
and so basically anything less than

519
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,840
about four-fold is not really

520
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,120
a statistically significant

521
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,959
difference

522
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:50,558
and most of these vary by less than

523
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,558
about five-fold

524
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,240
so you say generally for most these

525
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,439
transcription factors you've got a fair

526
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,400
amount of consistency in how much of it

527
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,640
um

528
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,280
uh you know what it what is the

529
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,280
the expression level of this thing

530
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,960
but saying that most of them are

531
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,359
consistent

532
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,880
there's a substantial set of these about

533
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,759
a third of them

534
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,840
where

535
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,038
the differences that you see between

536
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:22,879
different trichome libraries is between

537
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,960
one and three orders of magnitude

538
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,039
so this is some of these are from all

539
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,360
the way off to

540
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,240
on at a pretty good level

541
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,000
so

542
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,038
part of the differences that we see

543
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,038
between different

544
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,759
different trichomes in terms of the

545
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,320
phenotype

546
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,319
it can be traced straight back to

547
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,960
the

548
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,240
the transcriptional regulation

549
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,880
environment

550
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,120
okay i'm going to switch over now to the

551
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,000
terpene synthase this is a slide i've

552
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:01,119
been using for a while

553
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,119
this is um i think it worked out to be

554
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,119
778

555
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:11,038
samples

556
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:14,400
this is when uh uh i was at steephill

557
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,480
labs we were testing labs so this is

558
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,400
mostly recreational

559
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,038
cannabis samples coming in the front

560
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,798
door for testing and having

561
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,158
a terpene

562
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,279
profile

563
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,159
done on them so the terpenes are ranked

564
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,918
here

565
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,039
by

566
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,120
total

567
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,640
amount mercine

568
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,678
caryophyllene limonene pinene you know

569
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,240
being

570
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,240
the most abundant ones

571
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,919
one of the interesting things about this

572
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,640
is like for mercene the number of of

573
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,440
enzymes that make mercene it's hard to

574
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,640
get a zero mercy in plant but you do get

575
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,120
some

576
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,038
that have not got very much that's kind

577
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,479
of interesting but you look down here at

578
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,640
terpenoline

579
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,360
when terpenoline is on

580
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,080
it tends to be really on when terpene is

581
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,119
on it tends to be the dominant

582
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,798
terpene

583
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,879
uh in that plant but there's a lot of

584
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:11,839
the time there's a lot of these where

585
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
there's

586
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,038
little bits

587
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,919
and there's a number of these where

588
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,119
there's

589
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,440
none

590
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,038
well it turns out

591
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,519
there's two enzymes that we know about

592
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:26,000
so far that make um terpenoline one of

593
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,480
them makes it as a side product and it's

594
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,519
not a lot

595
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,079
and the other one tps

596
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,519
37

597
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,879
makes terpenoline as its major

598
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,918
its major

599
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,640
product

600
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,919
and i'm going to in the interest of time

601
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,320
i'm going to

602
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,880
keep going here so

603
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,439
looking at

604
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,480
terpene synthase expression again this

605
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,679
is going across the same 14 trichome

606
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,960
libraries

607
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,960
you see large changes

608
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,400
in the amount

609
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,840
of expression

610
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,480
but you look at some of these like tps20

611
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,639
it can go from very strong

612
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,839
to zero

613
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,360
and

614
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:15,678
well

615
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:18,319
what's going on with that so

616
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,440
i think this this is close to my last

617
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,639
slide

618
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,440
um

619
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,440
what i did

620
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:29,599
we began to suspect that there was

621
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:32,080
substantial presence absence variation

622
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,278
going on in this family so what i did

623
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,199
was

624
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,640
i pulled together

625
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:42,720
six different genome assemblies and then

626
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:46,080
i did a gene discovery run using um

627
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,038
genome threader and exonerate

628
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,558
and then as my as my

629
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,919
bait i use the complete set of known

630
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,319
thc or

631
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,759
a terpene synthase

632
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,798
genes

633
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,119
so and in terms of gene discovery

634
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,759
the more similar

635
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,759
your bait gene is to what's in the

636
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,038
genome the higher the probability is

637
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,278
that you're going to pull out what

638
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,440
you're looking for so this is really

639
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,400
shooting fish in a barrel

640
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,720
if the gene is present in the genome

641
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,159
i'm going to find it

642
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,960
so looking first at

643
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,200
the

644
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:31,519
um the tree here so this works out to be

645
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,159
um about 46 genes but it's

646
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,240
it's hard to say exactly how many

647
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,880
terpene synthase genes there there are

648
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,960
in cannabis because every every line you

649
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,840
pick up has a different number

650
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,200
and then you have all of these genes

651
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,119
that

652
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,159
you know they're they're not the same in

653
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,719
each plant so you gotta ask you know

654
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,679
five snips it's probably the same gene

655
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,000
20 snips is it the same gene or is it

656
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,880
not it's kind of hard to tell

657
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,200
uh

658
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,640
so in terms of

659
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,600
the structure of this family um you've

660
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,679
got your uh

661
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:13,678
clade b here

662
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,880
this is um your monoterpene synthesis

663
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,798
down here

664
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,480
clade a

665
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:23,359
these are sesquiterpene uh

666
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,319
synthases and then clay g

667
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:28,319
these can make a mixture

668
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,200
of either and then the little

669
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:34,639
dots here the dark dot means that i was

670
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,679
able to find a chloroplast import signal

671
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,559
on it

672
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,080
and

673
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:42,480
the yellow dots means there was one well

674
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,000
the sesquiterpene synthases stay in the

675
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,720
cytoplasm

676
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,679
the monoterpene synthases go into the

677
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,278
plastid which is where

678
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,080
gpp

679
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,079
is made which is the precursor for the

680
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,558
monoterpene synthases

681
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,398
running out of time here but basically

682
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,440
what i found

683
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:06,959
is that so this is a heat map that is

684
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:11,278
not expression this is the number of

685
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,919
genes that i found within a 95

686
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,359
percent identity so light green means i

687
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,600
found one

688
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,038
white means i found

689
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,158
zero

690
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:25,759
medium green means i found two and then

691
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,640
dark green is three or more

692
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,879
so

693
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,399
and they're not necessarily identical

694
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,320
some of these like

695
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,558
tps 9

696
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,599
over here in jamaican lion there are two

697
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,398
copies that are almost completely um

698
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:42,398
identical some of these that's the like

699
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:43,678
you know 96 percent

700
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,199
identical

701
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,480
to each other

702
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,880
but uh

703
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,440
there is a tremendous amount of presence

704
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,360
absence variation going on here and tps

705
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,440
37 was not present in any of the genomes

706
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,000
that i looked at we have now

707
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,919
we've gone past this and we've we've

708
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,759
determined uh using pcr approaches uh

709
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,520
that

710
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:10,158
tps37 has strong presence absence

711
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,319
behavior and the reason some plants

712
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,039
don't have tropinolane is because they

713
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,319
lack the gene completely okay i need to

714
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:17,359
move on pretty quickly i'm running out

715
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,119
of time

716
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,278
so conclusions

717
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,319
while the cannabinoids are not specific

718
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,960
to cannabis the gene family responsible

719
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,960
for their production in cannabis seems

720
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,319
to be a specific innovation of the

721
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,278
species

722
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,599
the thc and cbd synthesis don't appear

723
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,159
to ever be present more than one copy

724
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:41,678
but the other two clays cbc synthase and

725
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,720
clad c groups are quite variable

726
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,200
in copy number each clade within the

727
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,480
cannabinoid family has its own promoter

728
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,200
structure

729
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,919
the evolution of the cannabinoid clade

730
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,159
occurred under strong selection

731
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,240
pressure

732
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,919
and there is substantial presence

733
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,839
absence variation in the terpene

734
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,960
synthase family and this along with the

735
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:05,439
expression

736
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,440
uh is is probably adequate to explain

737
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,080
the range of phenotypes that we see and

738
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,159
then in particular the on off behavior

739
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,278
of trapinolane seems to result from the

740
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:19,480
presence or absence of tps37 and that is

741
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,480
the end of my time thank you very much
