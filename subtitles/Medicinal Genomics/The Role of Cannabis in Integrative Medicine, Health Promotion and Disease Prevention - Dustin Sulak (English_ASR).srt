1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,250
I would like to start by expressing my

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,610
appreciation for you Stacy for asking

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,589
extraordinarily relevant questions

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,900
getting answers driving this field

5
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:20,670
forward thank you you are doing great

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:22,649
work maybe one more as well as my

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,689
appreciation for all of you here to

8
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,479
learn and I'm sure take this message and

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,689
spread it and and to can med for

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,460
organizing this and having me back today

11
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:34,530
so my name is Dustin Sulak I'm an

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,450
osteopathic general practitioner I've

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,090
been practicing cannabis medicine in

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,790
Maine for the last ten years and it's

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,670
been an incredible gift to myself and my

16
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:46,920
patients so oh we've got the slides up

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,609
here but I don't see them down here

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,890
maybe we'll just dig right in so today

19
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,009
I'm talking about cannabis and its role

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,820
in integrative medicine health promotion

21
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:02,460
and disease prevention and so to begin

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,978
with well here's an overview integrative

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,930
medicine principles we'll just go

24
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,760
through as a roadmap and I think

25
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,350
probably a lot of you aren't aware of

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,180
these principles which are a great

27
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,069
solution to some of the biggest

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,310
challenges we have in healthcare today

29
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:18,298
and it demonstrate a really nice example

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,519
of how cannabis

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,430
is not just helping patients but also

32
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,009
helping change medicine we'll also touch

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,130
on psychoactive adverse effects and

34
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,868
psychoactive benefits natural acidic

35
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,359
cannabinoids their bioavailability

36
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:36,239
dosing and if we have time a bit of

37
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,030
their utility and how to use cannabis to

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,609
prevent disease so I want to start off

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,129
with a little attention to a very big

40
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,938
problem that we have here in this

41
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,118
country

42
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,459
we are doing a terrible job taking care

43
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:54,170
of people our health care system per

44
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:57,899
capita spent 10,000 we spent 10 over

45
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,810
$10,000 per person per year on health

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,210
care that's almost 18 percent of our

47
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,430
gross domestic product totaling three

48
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,798
point three trillion dollars spent in

49
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,750
this country on health care but despite

50
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,349
spending more on health care than any

51
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,889
other country we fail miserably we rank

52
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:16,560
less

53
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:19,709
or near last on dimensions of healthy

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,939
lives access to health care F efficiency

55
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:26,939
and health care equity actually in in

56
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:29,400
2013 the Institute of Medicine reported

57
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,250
that we have worse health and premature

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,800
death rates than any other country at

59
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,259
every age group and every income level

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,140
we are clearly spending a lot of money

61
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,329
and doing something wrong so what's the

62
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:44,819
solution to this problem well they're

63
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,290
actually outlet let me start here what

64
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,689
are the contributing factors

65
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:50,849
there's many but I believe that one is

66
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:54,840
this over-reliance on monomolecular

67
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:57,810
therapies we know that we are complex

68
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,150
systems with multiple redundant pathways

69
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,759
and multiple nodes for each disease

70
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,370
states and the idea of using a single

71
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,409
molecule to influence that system in a

72
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,569
direction towards health it works

73
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:12,479
sometimes but it doesn't work a lot of

74
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:15,030
the times and we really overuse that we

75
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,709
tend to manage chronic disease instead

76
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,799
of prevent it that's a mistake

77
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,299
we and and I just hope the whole

78
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,439
healthcare infrastructure and the

79
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:27,150
economics of healthcare really promote a

80
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,250
benefit to the system when people are

81
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,379
sick and their diseases manage not when

82
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,909
it's cured or prevented so the

83
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,439
incentives are all backwards

84
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,500
and there's many other contributing

85
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,669
factors so there is a solution and as

86
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,129
you'll see many times in this

87
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:43,379
presentation I give a nod to one of my

88
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:47,509
beloved mentors and friends Andrew Weil

89
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:50,729
who has I just respect him so deeply for

90
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:52,769
profoundly changing the direction and

91
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,738
trajectory of medicine because I believe

92
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,360
what he said 20 years ago at some point

93
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,730
integrative medicine will simply be

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,590
called good medicine I think we're

95
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:03,000
starting to see that become true so

96
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,009
there are eight principles that have

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,379
been identified by a consortium of

98
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:08,849
integrative medicine establishments and

99
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,310
I'm gonna walk through them the first is

100
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:14,639
a partnership between patient and

101
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,620
practitioner in the healing process and

102
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,509
partnership this is something that's

103
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,250
kind of new to medicine it used to be

104
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,500
this kind of top-down I'm the doctor I'm

105
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,990
going to tell you what to do that does

106
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,540
not work with medical cannabis why

107
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,550
because there's so many different form

108
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,560
Stacy pointed out so many different

109
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,530
types of cannabis delivery methods

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,170
individual responses the need for dose

111
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:39,419
titration to find someone's optimal dose

112
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,910
an optimal regimen there's a lot of

113
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,129
back-and-forth between patient and

114
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,310
practitioner it's a real partnership in

115
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:49,439
the healing process this is essential in

116
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,589
getting great results with medical

117
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,750
cannabis patients become empowered to

118
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,579
feel like they have the reins on their

119
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,579
own health and they can make decisions

120
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:01,800
that it improves their self-care because

121
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:03,449
now they're there making those decisions

122
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,220
that are administering the cannabis to

123
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,709
themselves they're taking notes and at

124
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,500
least in my practice and building self

125
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:13,349
awareness which leads to self-efficacy a

126
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,149
can-do attitude of feeling like they can

127
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,129
get better and they can participate in

128
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:19,079
their healing and then there's the

129
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:21,329
therapeutic horticulture which is an

130
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,189
incredible aspect of cannabis that's

131
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:26,189
often not mentioned but when a patient

132
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:28,379
can take a seed or a cutting and put it

133
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:30,509
in their backyard and watch the plant

134
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,519
grow and celebrate its growth and look

135
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:34,860
at the beauty of this plant and then

136
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,609
harvest it and produce a medicine in

137
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,069
their home

138
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,509
that's cost-effective that they can use

139
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,480
for the whole year and take care of

140
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:48,269
themselves that is incredible that is

141
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:50,640
empowerment that's a solution thank you

142
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:52,680
and for everyone in here that's involved

143
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,259
in the cannabis industry if you have any

144
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,240
influence in politics and lobbying

145
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,219
please there's many states right now

146
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,230
where it's still not legal for patients

147
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,030
to grow and produce their own medicine

148
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,980
whether it helps or hurts your bottom

149
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:10,589
line as a community we all have to

150
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:12,960
promote that availability this is thank

151
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:17,939
you this this is a picture from my

152
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:20,039
backyard the second principle is the

153
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,410
appropriate use of conventional and

154
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,050
alternative methods to facilitate the

155
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,240
body's innate healing response this is

156
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,879
something that medicine often overlooks

157
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,069
we're focused on the disease not on the

158
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,769
health the founder of Osteopathy said

159
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,750
anyone can find that disease the job of

160
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,459
the physician is to find the health in

161
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,649
the patient so if we're talking about

162
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,189
innate healing response the question is

163
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,810
will

164
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,879
can we do to support that innate healing

165
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,680
response and what can we do to remove

166
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,589
obstructions from that innate healing

167
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,420
response and he won't have an idea of a

168
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:52,759
system that might be a good target for

169
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,870
doing just that

170
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,329
right the endocannabinoid system

171
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,990
involved in every disease and every

172
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:02,729
symptom known to man widely distributed

173
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,670
throughout our body as you can see here

174
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,890
cb1 and cb2 receptors addressing the

175
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,920
endocannabinoid system to help treat

176
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,750
disease and promote health via enhancing

177
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,790
our innate healing response makes

178
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,459
perfect sense and we've got a great tool

179
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,740
to be able to target this system it's in

180
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:21,810
our backyards if it's if that's possible

181
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,689
and it's and it's available more and

182
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,850
more now we don't necessarily need fancy

183
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:28,230
pharmaceutical drugs to target the

184
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,040
system even though there's a place for

185
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,990
them the third the third principle is

186
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,170
the consideration of all factors that

187
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:39,810
influence health wellness and disease

188
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:42,240
including mind spirit and community in

189
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,418
addition to body I want to focus on mind

190
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,030
spirit and community so the psychoactive

191
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,089
adverse effects versus benefits what are

192
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:53,250
the adverse effects impaired memory

193
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:56,729
confusion anxiety paranoia dis

194
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,560
coordination dizziness being tired these

195
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,750
are things I see is side effects in my

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,750
practice typically related to excessive

197
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,350
doses of THC and also related to factors

198
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,879
in set and settings so what is someone's

199
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,650
internal mindset what are they expecting

200
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,300
out of cannabis and what are their goals

201
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:14,519
and intentions and then what's their

202
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,389
external setting that influences a

203
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,799
person's response to cannabis these are

204
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,839
usually mild and self-limited some

205
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,540
people will complain of residual effects

206
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,549
the following day but what are the

207
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,069
psychoactive benefits of cannabis well

208
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,139
to begin with this euphoria which has

209
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:33,838
been described as a side effect in many

210
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,819
papers in my opinion this is a gift to

211
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,909
patients that are suffering if we can

212
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,210
help them feel positive mood relaxation

213
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:43,649
laughter socializing time distortion

214
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,570
which allows them to come into the

215
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,389
present moment and then the

216
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,000
intensification of ordinary experiences

217
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:53,879
which can be leveraged for a practice of

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,269
mindfulness called savoring savoring is

219
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,059
a

220
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:58,980
recked antidote to anhedonia which is a

221
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,739
major culprit in depression and

222
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,019
especially opioid use disorder when

223
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,539
people are no longer able to experience

224
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,829
pleasure from the natural things in

225
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:09,929
their life that should give them

226
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,150
pleasure then they go seeking something

227
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:14,250
that temporarily gives them a stronger

228
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,980
pleasure signal and that's a downward

229
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,259
spiral and so just having to use a drug

230
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,840
or a substance to feel normal

231
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,809
cannabis can absolutely break that cycle

232
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,389
especially THC when used intentionally

233
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:29,909
to support a process of savoring people

234
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:32,309
can restore the natural pleasure they

235
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:34,799
get from these healthy activities in

236
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:36,989
their lives including eating listening

237
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,019
to music having sex just connecting

238
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,940
taking a walk smelling the flowers now

239
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,710
there's also something I've seen over

240
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,050
and over again in my patients this

241
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,000
unbundling of symptoms and suffering

242
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:49,949
where they first come in and it's just

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,289
this ball of suffering and they they

244
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,810
feel like they need to escape and after

245
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:57,870
experiencing the psychoactive effects of

246
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:59,909
THC dominant cannabis or balanced THC

247
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,970
CBD cannabis they're able to tease this

248
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:05,129
apart and they realize there's this

249
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:08,100
sensation that's more neutral and in the

250
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:09,659
past they felt like that sensation was a

251
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,519
really bad thing but now they're not

252
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:13,350
judging it as much anymore so they're

253
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,409
not suffering as much from it anymore

254
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,930
less anxiety about continuing to have

255
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,669
that sensation that's now more neutral

256
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:22,439
and then less of the pain behavior

257
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:24,179
associated with that which impacts their

258
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,540
whole family and their whole community

259
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:30,029
this unbundling is an essential gift of

260
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,559
cannabis and then this return to

261
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,259
normality for all the cannabis

262
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,389
clinicians and caretakers and dispensary

263
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,639
agents in the room I wonder how many

264
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,980
times you've heard someone say this

265
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,980
plant has given me my life back can I

266
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,110
see a show of hands this is I thought it

267
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,360
was like a planted phrase that patients

268
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,789
were told to tell me because it just

269
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,680
happened so many times again again I've

270
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:56,159
gotten my life back but this is really

271
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,870
what people say and this was described

272
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,839
in a qualitative study that came out of

273
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,090
Israel and they called it restored self

274
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,920
a return to normality they feel like

275
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,310
they've lost their lives in canvas gives

276
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,719
them

277
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:08,969
life's back and what's interesting is

278
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,399
people report this even when their

279
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,440
symptoms don't improve their pain their

280
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,209
anxiety all their symptoms could be the

281
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,100
same but they still feel like cannabis

282
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,050
has given them their life back it's

283
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,899
incredible oops that's and went

284
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:25,459
backwards and then what our patients

285
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:28,799
reporting increased self-awareness a

286
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:32,190
sense of connection to God and nature

287
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,019
the universe viewing oneself from a

288
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,060
different vantage point these are all

289
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,429
really profound things that no

290
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,769
pharmaceutical medication will just give

291
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:42,838
to someone and and it goes on and on

292
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,240
feeling of acceptance of their place in

293
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,880
life and finding creative solutions to

294
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,089
their problems and this mental emotional

295
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,830
and physical capacity to change which is

296
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:55,980
likely correlated with enhanced

297
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:59,550
neuroplasticity now people experience

298
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,700
this during the acute effects of THC but

299
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:05,039
these gifts persist after the THC wears

300
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,740
off they take this with them the next

301
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,719
day in the next week this is a change in

302
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,730
their relationship with themselves and

303
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,100
with the world around them this is

304
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,839
profound hard to get this without the

305
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,330
psychoactive effects of cannabis and

306
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,310
then there's community the cannabis

307
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,980
community which we are all here together

308
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:24,869
in this cannabis community and I hope

309
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,850
that all of you that are new to the

310
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,029
community continue to have this

311
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,950
experience of wow the cannabis community

312
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:34,409
is really something special

313
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,509
people care people are altruistic

314
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:38,969
they're willing to help to lift each

315
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:41,939
other up there's a lot less greed a lot

316
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:46,830
less a lot less selfishness and more

317
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:50,220
more giving and this is the spirit of

318
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,410
cannabis and I hope that any of you have

319
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,690
a chance to experience this and that all

320
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:56,429
of you can become a part of that and

321
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,320
contribute it because if you let

322
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:00,689
cannabis in and let it teach you how to

323
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,300
live it teaches this community which is

324
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,310
really essential not just for fixing our

325
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,719
healthcare system but for healing our

326
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,739
world and we're not gonna get into all

327
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,220
the big problems in the world but

328
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,169
communities essentials so principles

329
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,330
number four and five a philosophy that

330
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:17,519
neither rejects conventional medicine

331
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,110
nor accepts alternative therapies

332
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,610
uncritically and the

333
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,070
cognition the good medicine should be

334
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,669
based in good science being inquiry

335
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,800
driven and be open to new paradigms so

336
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:32,578
of course we have some pretty good data

337
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:35,099
nicely summarized by the 2017 National

338
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:37,109
Academies report and there's conclusive

339
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,000
evidence that cannabis is effective for

340
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,459
chronic pain chemotherapy and induced

341
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,320
nausea and vomiting multiple sclerosis

342
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:46,109
spasticity at least subjective symptoms

343
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,149
and moderate evidence that cannabis or

344
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,310
cannabinoids associated with

345
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,259
improvements in sleep disturbance this

346
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:54,899
is great this comes out of big clinical

347
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,389
trials this is a start but this is a

348
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,629
very early start we need a lot more

349
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,129
we need new paradigms of thoughts

350
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:04,528
including what dr. Gruber has been doing

351
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:07,320
I think she's you know how I feel about

352
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:10,139
her work I also want to mention that

353
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,660
this doesn't all have to be limited to

354
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,028
artisanal and herbal cannabis the

355
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,730
concepts that we're learning here in

356
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:20,159
cannabis medicine using the herb can be

357
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,810
applied to the pharmaceutical industry

358
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,028
to drug research and drug development

359
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:26,309
and there's a perfect template for that

360
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:29,220
something called Network pharmacology

361
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:31,319
which is a new a newish approach to drug

362
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,540
discovery and it involves network

363
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,730
analysis to determine a whole set of

364
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,099
proteins critical in any disease and

365
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:41,310
then chemical biology to identify

366
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,129
molecules capable of targeting that set

367
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:46,619
of proteins it's usually a

368
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:48,809
multifactorial treatment that involves

369
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,028
multiple compounds and multiple targets

370
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:53,698
this is one example of a Chinese

371
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:56,070
medicine Qi Shen Yi Qi which treats

372
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:57,958
heart attack and other heart disease and

373
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,209
you can see here all the different

374
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,369
pathways the different genes that are

375
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:04,500
targeted and the different molecules

376
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,320
involved this is the type of systems

377
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,120
biology we need to take pharmaceutical

378
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,490
drug development to the next level and

379
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,600
stop looking for a single molecule and

380
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,639
hope that's going to solve all our

381
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,570
problems it hasn't worked and I don't

382
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,569
think it's going to

383
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:23,639
principle number six is the use of

384
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,819
natural effective and less invasive

385
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,129
interventions whenever possible has

386
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:31,679
cannabis demonstrated any of this well

387
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,879
to begin with when I was 19 years old I

388
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,309
read through this report from the

389
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,870
Institute of Medicine right after it

390
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,849
came out I was involved in cannabis

391
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,649
activism and I was so happy to get this

392
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,050
quote on my Flyers when I was tabling

393
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,879
except for the harms associated with

394
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:47,219
smoking the adverse effects of marijuana

395
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,339
use are within the range tolerated for

396
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,680
other medications no fatal overdose no

397
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:55,709
organ damage no permanent cognitive

398
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,568
deficits and adult heavy users and

399
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:00,088
actually improve neural cognition in

400
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:02,729
medical users a very low risk for abuse

401
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:05,220
especially with medical preparations

402
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,420
this is harm reduction this is less

403
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,028
invasive and less dangerous than

404
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:13,378
narcotics and opiates exile attacks

405
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:15,240
antidepressants nonsteroidals and so

406
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,629
forth look at the drugs that people are

407
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,669
using cannabis to substitute this is

408
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:24,000
much safer for the population a great

409
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:27,328
example of integrative medicine moving

410
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,850
on to principle number seven use of the

411
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:33,599
broader concepts of promotion of health

412
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:35,699
and prevention of illness as well as the

413
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,490
treatment of disease let's talk about

414
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:40,139
promoting health and preventing illness

415
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,938
and we can look at some of the leading

416
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,470
causes of death and we'll just start

417
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:45,389
with heart disease since that's high up

418
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,060
there but this conversation around

419
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:50,329
cannabis applies to cancer accident

420
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:53,909
strokes and perhaps lower respiratory

421
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:56,698
disease as well now here's an

422
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:59,969
interesting study where two micrograms

423
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:02,159
per kilogram of body weight of THC was

424
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,558
administered by injection to mice two

425
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:08,369
hours before giving them a heart attack

426
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:10,558
and this tiny tiny dose of THC which

427
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:12,750
most of you would expect to do nothing

428
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,459
which I would expect to do nothing ended

429
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,849
up protecting the heart from the heart

430
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,610
attack

431
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,649
improved fractional shortening decrease

432
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:21,869
the least the release of troponin which

433
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,569
is an enzyme that signal shows us the

434
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:26,938
heart cells are in trouble decrease the

435
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:28,859
size of the dead cells in the heart and

436
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,330
decrease the inflammation and

437
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:33,089
accumulation of neutrophil

438
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:35,879
to the area two micrograms per kilogram

439
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:37,859
I can't emphasize enough how tiny of a

440
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,230
dose ed is and this dose has been shown

441
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:42,629
in two other animal studies to have

442
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,940
effects both on protecting the brain and

443
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,320
protecting liver many of you that know

444
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,500
my work know I'm extraordinarily

445
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,329
interested in the ultra low dosing range

446
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,519
of cannabinoids there's something

447
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:56,460
special happening there so does this

448
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,410
work out in humans do people walking

449
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,730
around with tiny bits of THC in their

450
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,740
system actually have better outcomes

451
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,150
after a heart attack looks like the

452
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,490
answer is yes based on this

453
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:08,040
observational data of over a million

454
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,109
people comparing those who self-reported

455
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:12,000
using cannabis to those who didn't and

456
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:14,699
you can see that after having a heart

457
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,700
attack those who were cannabis self

458
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,380
reporters were less likely to die they

459
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,480
were less likely to have invasive

460
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,310
interventions like intra-arterial

461
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,230
balloon pump and percutaneous

462
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:27,779
interventions but they were more likely

463
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,610
to be put on a ventilator likely because

464
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,289
they were cannabis smokers and had some

465
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:34,049
impairment and their respiratory

466
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:36,000
function but do we know direction of

467
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:38,309
causality here no we don't there's an

468
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,529
association between self-reported

469
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:41,970
cannabis use and doing better after a

470
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:43,980
heart attack and I think that's a good

471
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,519
lead the preclinical data supports it

472
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,049
now what about preventing the the steps

473
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,549
that lead up to a heart attack right in

474
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:52,259
my opinion it's not just enough to

475
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,549
protect someone when they have a heart

476
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,470
attack we actually want to prevent that

477
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,049
from happening so we need to look at a

478
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,480
thorough sclerosis atherosclerosis it

479
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:02,730
turns out that a fairly low dose of THC

480
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,039
in rodents can prevent the development

481
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,620
or at least slowed down the development

482
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,019
of atherosclerosis this is a cb2

483
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:12,209
dependent process so THC could help with

484
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,639
this beta carry ethylene could help with

485
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,370
this this is an in general and

486
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,200
anti-inflammatory and tissue protective

487
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:22,319
activity that's happening inside the

488
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,259
blood vessels moving from heart disease

489
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,659
to brain injury some more human

490
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,519
observational data looking at people who

491
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,170
come into the hospital with a traumatic

492
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,509
brain injury and dividing them into

493
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,789
those that have THC in their system and

494
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:38,549
those that don't and guess what those

495
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:41,789
without THC eleven and a half percent of

496
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:44,089
them died those with THC only 2.4

497
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:46,668
percent died what might be caused

498
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:48,259
this well we have a little bit of

499
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:50,210
evidence you heard dr. Michelle M

500
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:52,278
speaking about it yesterday that the

501
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,190
cannabinoids are neuroprotective agents

502
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:57,589
and I think that most of us in this room

503
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,120
that really recognize this have kind of

504
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:01,189
that plan that we've told our

505
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,839
significant others about hey if this

506
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,750
ever happens to me I want you to get

507
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:07,069
some of these cannabinoids in my system

508
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,960
ASAP because it's likely that they're

509
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,970
protective or we could just keep low

510
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,940
levels in our systems anyways there's

511
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,890
another observational study another

512
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,960
observational study looking at brain

513
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,210
bleeds and again you can see that in the

514
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,048
cannabis negative group only 3 percent

515
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:26,840
survived or yeah 3 percent had no

516
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:29,119
symptoms 19 percent in the cannabis

517
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:31,129
group survived that brain and brain

518
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,168
bleed with no symptoms and you can see

519
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,510
that whole cannabis group on the top is

520
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:37,399
shifted over to the right there is a

521
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:40,460
neuro protective effect that is showing

522
00:20:37,398 --> 00:20:42,709
up in human patients what about obesity

523
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,240
and diabetes are these a big deal is

524
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,360
this worth talking about with disease

525
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,548
prevention and and health promotion you

526
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,319
can see what's happening on the map here

527
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,929
look at what's happened to our country

528
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:56,359
we've become a country of obese and

529
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:58,519
diabetic individuals there's a big

530
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:01,778
problem here the medical cost of

531
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:04,369
diabetes and obesity looking like over

532
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:06,288
300 billion dollars and that was several

533
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:08,538
years ago I'm sure it's probably four or

534
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:10,278
five hundred billion dollars now I want

535
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:13,669
to help put that into perspective in

536
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:16,159
2008 the UN estimated the cost for

537
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:18,409
feeding every hungry person in the world

538
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,710
for eliminating hunger in the world

539
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:24,080
thirty billion dollars per year and if

540
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,450
we would all get together as a global

541
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,579
community and spend 30 billion dollars a

542
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,830
year for ten years in a row there would

543
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:33,678
be a sustainable infrastructure to

544
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:36,288
prevent starvation and hunger ongoing

545
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,240
what are we doing instead we're over

546
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:39,740
feeding ourselves with a bunch of crap

547
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,808
and then spending hundreds of billions

548
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,970
of dollars on the sequelae there's a

549
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:46,220
problem there but I also do like to put

550
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,679
that into perspective compared to our

551
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,600
u.s. annual defense budget now what if

552
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,059
our defense strategy was to eliminate

553
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,490
poverty and to eliminate hunger do you

554
00:21:53,058 --> 00:22:00,440
think that would make us safer

555
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:02,960
I think that might help end war maybe

556
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,298
maybe that's the new mission someday

557
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,360
now cannabis use is associated with

558
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:10,548
lower incidence of obesity you can see

559
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:12,709
from two large data sets here also

560
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:14,869
associated with a lower incidence of

561
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,579
diabetes and then just in the last year

562
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:18,500
we've had a lot more data come out

563
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:21,460
showing this is from the Pittsburgh

564
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,230
youth study which followed people over

565
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,750
more than 20 years and found that

566
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,940
greater cannabis use was associated with

567
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,339
improvements in all of these cardio

568
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,580
metabolic risk factors this beats the

569
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:38,000
pants off of a statin drug we yeah I

570
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:40,699
mean this this is again no direction of

571
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,829
causality this is an association but the

572
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,509
data comes up again and again maybe it

573
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:47,148
is just that cannabis users are more

574
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:49,369
likely to go exercise and be runners and

575
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:51,500
make healthier choices and maybe it's a

576
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:53,658
direct physiologic cause or maybe it's

577
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,308
some combination maybe the cannabis is

578
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:57,140
actually helping people wake up and

579
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:58,849
realize that they are beautiful and they

580
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,799
are lovable and they're worth taking

581
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:02,569
care of and it makes sense to make the

582
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,869
right choices to support a healthy and

583
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:08,898
happy life that's what I'm seeing now is

584
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:11,709
there a preclinical basis for a causal

585
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:14,329
effect of cannabis preventing obesity

586
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,788
absolutely you can take mice and give

587
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:19,460
them an obesogenic diet but when it's

588
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:21,859
given in the presence of THC they do not

589
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,740
become obese they maintain their normal

590
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:26,839
weight that's something I think that

591
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,819
maybe we're starting you know this isn't

592
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,639
a cure-all but I think that cannabis is

593
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:33,319
likely to help most people with their

594
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,690
metabolic function in their metabolic

595
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:37,730
physiology when I started my practice as

596
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,200
a cannabis clinician I was very scared

597
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,599
that my overweight patients were going

598
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,399
to get more overweight that they get the

599
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,740
munchies and this is one of the major

600
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:47,869
potential side effects and I have not

601
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,819
seen that in a decade of practice most

602
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:51,229
people's weight normalized those that

603
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:53,000
are over weight lose weight those that

604
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,190
are underweight gain weight cannabis is

605
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,159
this great homeostatic regulator and

606
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,990
it's doing that at this level as well so

607
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,120
how to use cannabis for Health Promotion

608
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,308
and disease prevention

609
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,989
well this is a metaphor that I use with

610
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:06,500
a lot of my patients so I'll walk you

611
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,660
through it

612
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,730
cannabis can be a crutch and

613
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,290
this can be a tonic so when someone

614
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,000
breaks their leg if they want to still

615
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:15,950
move about they do need to get the

616
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,869
weight off of that fracture because if

617
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,789
they don't it's not going to heal so

618
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:21,979
they use a crutch for a while they are

619
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:24,440
now able to walk around and let that leg

620
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,930
heal but if they never stop using the

621
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,660
crutch the leg will not finish its

622
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:31,759
healing that's because it's the force

623
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,590
vectors going through the bone in the

624
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,319
connective tissue that actually

625
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:38,299
stimulate those final stages of knitting

626
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,039
together and healing so at some point

627
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:42,440
they have to put down the crutch and

628
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:44,359
start bearing weight people have to do

629
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,240
that with cannabis as well our sickest

630
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:49,039
patients can use cannabis in a way that

631
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,599
helps them manage and helps get through

632
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,819
their life but then as they start to

633
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:55,519
heal they tend to shift their cannabis

634
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:57,349
use patterns and need less of it and use

635
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,569
it in different ways and eventually

636
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:01,939
they're feeling so good it's no longer a

637
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:05,599
crutch cannabis becomes a tonic so

638
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,940
what's a tonic or an adaptogen a tonic

639
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,609
is a compound or a substance or perhaps

640
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,700
a practice that improves our resilience

641
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:16,639
to stress we live in an incredibly toxic

642
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,799
environment chemically toxic socially

643
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,170
and psychologically toxic there's so

644
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,450
many challenges to being healthy

645
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:26,120
nowadays that I think a lot of us

646
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:28,460
recognize we need to rely on botanical

647
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:30,889
medicines in order to support our health

648
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,380
and to stay healthy so what does it look

649
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,840
like when cannabis is used as a tonic

650
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,300
well first of all I recommend strongly

651
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:41,059
using the lowest effective dose because

652
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:42,859
if you're building tolerance to THC then

653
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,929
you're likely building tolerance to your

654
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:48,139
endocannabinoids and you're undermining

655
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:50,509
the efficacy of your primary homeostatic

656
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,759
modulatory system that endocannabinoid

657
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:55,069
system so don't build tolerance to THC

658
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,569
use the lowest effective dose and many

659
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:59,119
of you would be surprised how low that

660
00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:01,339
dose can be number one and number two is

661
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,219
use cannabis to promote restorative

662
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:05,720
sleep this is my primary goal in any of

663
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,900
my patients that aren't sleeping well

664
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,750
THC works so well for sleep use cannabis

665
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,150
to reduce stress use cannabis to enhance

666
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,309
health promoting activities cannabis is

667
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,650
not to be used as a pharmaceutical

668
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:21,909
medication it can act that way but it's

669
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,860
even more powerful as an adjunct to

670
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,470
other treatments an adjunct to lifestyle

671
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:29,079
change especially so cannabis with

672
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,660
exercise cannabis with meditation with

673
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,909
the savoring practice I described

674
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,460
earlier incorporate the psychoactive

675
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,259
benefits into your life so for a lot of

676
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,700
my patients that come in and say I don't

677
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:41,049
want to get high I never want to get

678
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,730
high okay that's fine how are you

679
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:45,099
sleeping terribly we're gonna start

680
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,569
using a little THC right before bed they

681
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:48,849
come back three months later they're

682
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:51,039
sleeping beautifully the next step is

683
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:52,569
okay once or twice a week when you don't

684
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,149
have much going on in the evening take

685
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,859
that THC dose from bedtime and bump it

686
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,570
up to dinnertime and just let me know

687
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:00,909
how you feel and they come back oh that

688
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:02,740
was so wonderful I felt happy I was

689
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,269
relaxed it wasn't like I thought it

690
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,430
would be I thought it was something like

691
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:07,750
psychedelic hallucinatory thing no it

692
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,610
just felt good I liked it way better

693
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:12,190
than two glasses of wine that's what

694
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:15,009
people come back and tell me and then

695
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,500
avoid or limit combustion I think that

696
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,359
avoiding combustion in my mind means

697
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,490
avoiding so-called vape pens or

698
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,139
combustion pens and we don't need to say

699
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,420
any more about that but if you're having

700
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,310
a toke once or twice a day or once or

701
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,340
twice a week I don't think that's really

702
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:32,740
hurting your lungs very much but the dry

703
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:35,319
flower the herbal vaporizers are

704
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,779
probably the best way to inhale cannabis

705
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:39,819
if inhalation is a desired route and

706
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,069
then finally I want to end up with raw

707
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:44,649
cannabis which I think from an ethno

708
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:46,899
botanical standpoint and based on my own

709
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,480
experience in myself and in my patients

710
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:52,930
it's the raw cannabis that is the best

711
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,089
form of cannabis as a tonic if you want

712
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:57,580
to use cannabis to stay healthy and to

713
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:59,429
prevent disease check this out so this

714
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:02,649
these is some this is some of the first

715
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:06,160
pharmacokinetic data of oral absorption

716
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,990
of THC and CBD a and just nine people

717
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,330
with medication overuse headache and

718
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,640
they took like a type 2 variety of

719
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:15,039
cannabis had some THC some CBD in it

720
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,530
made into a decoction which is like a

721
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,500
tea except it's covered and simmered for

722
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:23,950
a bit in water or an oil and you can see

723
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,960
the these are the pharmacokinetic data

724
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,180
showing the bioavailability you might

725
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,059
notice one peak that really stands out

726
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,400
there in orange on the left we have the

727
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:35,788
decoction and on the right we have the

728
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,210
oil that orange peak is THC

729
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:42,419
a THCA is being absorbed far more than

730
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:45,179
THC if you look at this one CBD a look

731
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:48,450
at the bioavailability of CBD a compared

732
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:50,639
to CBD this is impressive at the top of

733
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,710
the slide here you can see what the

734
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:55,918
actual composition of the oil in the

735
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:58,048
decoction look like but I did the math

736
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,299
for you these are the areas under the

737
00:28:58,048 --> 00:29:04,168
curve so in the decoction THC a was

738
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:06,778
absorbed 50 times better than THC CBD a

739
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:09,899
was absorbed five times better than CBD

740
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:13,499
and the oil THC a was absorbed 32 times

741
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:16,768
better than THC and in the oil CBD a was

742
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:19,858
absorbed 11 times better than CBD high

743
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:21,749
bioavailability so how do we do this how

744
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:23,098
do we use cannabis to promote health and

745
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:24,598
prevent disease well these pictures

746
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:27,178
aren't actually that accurate so stop

747
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:28,858
taking pictures of them I'm I'm gonna

748
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,090
I'm gonna tell you how to do it you take

749
00:29:28,858 --> 00:29:32,460
a little bud

750
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:35,428
hopefully it's a type 2 variety that has

751
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,069
some CBD and THC A in it you put it in

752
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:40,288
your mug and you pour the hot water on

753
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:42,479
top of it or the hot coffee or whatever

754
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:44,339
tea however you like your hot beverage

755
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:45,690
in the morning include a little nugget

756
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:47,189
in there and then when you're done

757
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,200
drinking it if you willing take that

758
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,090
thing and eat it that's it by little but

759
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,950
I mean something about the size of a pea

760
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:55,499
you really don't need much it can be

761
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,119
tiny and what my patients tell me is

762
00:29:55,499 --> 00:30:00,239
when they start doing this they don't

763
00:29:57,118 --> 00:30:01,978
notice much until about two weeks and

764
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:03,808
then there are thright it starts feeling

765
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:06,269
better the resilience of stress starts

766
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:08,128
improving this is not as fast acting as

767
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:10,409
the decarboxylated cannabinoids but

768
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:12,628
extraordinarily powerful and I encourage

769
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:16,169
you to try it try incorporating it we

770
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:18,778
don't need the you know maybe there's a

771
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:20,129
place for stabilized acidic cannabinoids

772
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:21,808
but trust me if you've got some of these

773
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:23,579
buds in your cabinet or in your fridge

774
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:26,358
you can absolutely take those and start

775
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:28,829
using them right now without a lot of

776
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:31,259
without waiting for a pharmaceutical

777
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:33,509
product it's right there at home the

778
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:35,069
acidic cannabinoids and then finally I'd

779
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:37,769
like to end up with principle number

780
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:40,229
eight training of practitioners to be

781
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:42,628
models of health and healing committed

782
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:45,989
to the process of self-exploration and

783
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:49,169
self-development I hope that as a

784
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:51,180
cannabis expert of physician and edge

785
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,310
educator and a steward of this plant

786
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,570
that I am walking my talk and living

787
00:30:53,309 --> 00:31:00,710
this principle thank you

788
00:30:55,569 --> 00:31:00,710
[Applause]
