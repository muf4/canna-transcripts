1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,679
[Music]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,679
and sort of talking about clinical

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,640
applications or maybe you know future

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,960
research has any of your findings led to

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,240
any clinical trials or real world

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:27,279
applications yet?

7
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:29,358
So yes and and both both questions are

8
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,280
the answer is yes it's lead to clinical

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,960
trials and it lead to real world

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,480
applications. So in three cases first of

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,759
all I want to take one step back okay

12
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:44,439
and to explain cannabis is a given name

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,960
to hundred or thousands of different

14
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:48,959
chemovs each one of them contain

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,600
different combination of molecules and

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,120
we just talked that this combination is

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,280
important for the effects okay cancer

18
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,839
it's a given name to thousands of

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,760
different diseases we have in our body

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,000
220ome different types of cells Each

21
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,879
type of cell have different types of

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,719
cancer. Our you know lung cancer, breast

23
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:14,798
cancer, skin cancer are totally

24
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,239
different. It's a different diseases.

25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,040
But even in one type of cancer, breast

26
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,519
cancer, we have 20ome different types.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,439
So altogether you're talking about

28
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,560
thousands of different chemovirus of

29
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,959
cannabis and thousands of different

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,000
diseases. And now my goal in my lab or

31
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,719
my what I'm trying is to

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,118
match a specific cannabis to a specific

33
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,039
cancer. So it's not that cannabis can

34
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,840
cure cancer or cannabis can treat

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,560
cancer. There are specific types of

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,320
cannabis or molecules in the cannabis

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,200
they might help or cure specific types

38
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,078
of cancer. So that's first of all let's

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,280
bring it back to earth. Okay. Right. But

40
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:02,798
if at least in three cases, three types

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,879
of cancers and mutation, we already know

42
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,719
which cannabis, which which combination

43
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,959
of

44
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:12,000
molecules can kill this cancer when you

45
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,199
have this mutation. So in leukemia with

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,479
a specific mutation called notch one

47
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,318
mutation, I already know what are the

48
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,159
molecules in the cannabis that will

49
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:24,399
always kill the cells. So if a leukemia

50
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,598
patient have a mutation called notch one

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,480
and 50% of the leukemia patient it's not

52
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,318
all the leukemia but it's around 60%

53
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:36,639
actually okay so this type of cancer

54
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,878
will treat as a chem chemotherapy or

55
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,199
radiation without all the side effects

56
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,639
and everything right but the idea it

57
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,159
would be the same it's killing the

58
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:51,439
cancer cells so we have three types of

59
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:55,598
cancers like that and and we are in two

60
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:57,919
of them we started the process I open a

61
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,959
company raise money we started the

62
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:04,759
process to go to clinical trials that's

63
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,959
one and on the other hand we created

64
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:12,598
products cannabis product extracts or or

65
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:15,598
flowers that we aiming the specific

66
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:18,598
patient not to take a general cannabis

67
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:22,399
to take this cannabis and usually I'm

68
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,719
very gentle on that. I'm I'm saying if

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,480
you have leukemia and you have this type

70
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,158
of leukemia and you're already going to

71
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,000
take cannabis and you don't know what

72
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,158
you're taking and you don't care, why

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,318
won't you take this? Okay, that we have

74
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,079
science on that and research and we know

75
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,479
it's no I'm not coming to the patient

76
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,640
this will cure you. I said if you're

77
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,039
taking it arbitrarily and you don't know

78
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,238
what you're taking and it's just you

79
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,280
know trial and error start with this.

80
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,519
Mhm. This I can think can help you and

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,280
then we are following on the p following

82
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,879
on the patient they're taking looking

83
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,878
the improvement and and and so and

84
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:02,158
so we are doing that. Yes. Excellent.

85
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,878
And it's again phenomenal. It's it's

86
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:08,079
amazing feeling you know a scientist

87
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:11,919
usually like me even when you finding

88
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:16,799
something and you have amazing findings

89
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:20,319
in the lab until a patient will touch it

90
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,679
it's 10 15 years something like that you

91
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:27,279
know when I did my posto in Toronto

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,680
father of one of the PhD student that

93
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,638
was that works with me and she's still a

94
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,519
good

95
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,889
He was a very important scientist in in

96
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,240
Vancouver

97
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:42,039
[Music]

98
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,120
and he was the ones that invent the the

99
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,560
Fiser COVID

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,560
19 vaccination. Okay. So he won you know

101
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,000
all the prizes in the world after that

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,439
he become a billionaire but this is a

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,560
different story. um he he came to give a

104
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,439
talk in my university a few months ago

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,839
and he he stand and he

106
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:07,439
said it's it's amazing how we succeed to

107
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:11,038
create a medicine in in eight months to

108
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,160
this virus but now in my talk I want to

109
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:17,120
show you that it took 40

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:20,199
years that it took me 40 years okay so

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,759
I'm coming back to what I say I meant to

112
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:27,720
say usually to a scientist in the

113
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,800
to have a results and to affect a

114
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,199
patient if he's lucky and if he's you

115
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,120
know amazing and and got a Nobel Prize

116
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:41,280
it's 15 20 years in my field in my work

117
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,199
sometimes we finding something and two

118
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,599
weeks after it can already be in in I

119
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,840
can already recommend the patient or

120
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,560
help a patient with that because the

121
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:55,839
product is on the shelf I just need to

122
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,720
point him to what we found and think and

123
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:03,159
and this is very unique situation very

124
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,520
unique feeling I'm very

125
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:10,720
very careful or you know I don't know

126
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,359
how to say that very I'm not saying

127
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,160
things that I'm not

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,120
100% sure about them when I not 100%

129
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,280
sure that it will help and not make do a

130
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,319
damage but when you know something and

131
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,679
you help. It's really good feeling. So

132
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,240
that's interesting. So it's a unique

133
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,439
situation that patients kind of have

134
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,439
access to this medicine um early on

135
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,319
where that's not typically the case with

136
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,240
other other compounds. They have they

137
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,400
have an access to the medicine before

138
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,160
you pure you prove it's really a

139
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,000
medicine. So yeah, they have the access

140
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,000
before they have the knowledge. Right.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Exactly.

142
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:02,150
