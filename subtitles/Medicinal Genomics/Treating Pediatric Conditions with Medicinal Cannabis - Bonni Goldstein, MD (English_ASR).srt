1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,888
good morning everybody so I've spent the

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,629
last ten years I've been a doctor now

3
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,689
almost 30 years but I've spent the last

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,070
ten years as a pediatric cannabis doctor

5
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,629
I also take care of adults when I

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,000
started my practice it was mostly adults

7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:24,089
but I just wanted to share with you

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,410
these are all some patients of mine that

9
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,960
are using multiple different

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,000
cannabinoids to enhance the quality of

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,079
their lives and these include cancer

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,469
patients children with genetic diseases

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,270
children who have had issues since birth

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:42,090
and it's been really very rewarding

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,010
here's some other kids as well if you

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,450
could see the top middle photo this is a

17
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:47,579
little boy that was never supposed to

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,560
walk and he came walking into my office

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,960
this year so that's kind of amazing

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,899
the little boy all the way on your right

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,509
on the top said mama for the first time

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,160
at age six so anybody who's worried

23
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:02,070
about damaging little brains with

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:06,118
cannabis it doesn't happen it appears to

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,069
actually make brains move forward so the

26
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,400
conditions that I take care of mostly

27
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,769
are here treatment-resistant epilepsy by

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,840
far as the number one condition I see in

29
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,658
Pediatrics however autism is coming in

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,030
as a very close second unfortunately I

31
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,979
do see children with cancer most of them

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,530
are advanced cancers metastatic who have

33
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,510
been giving very poor prognosis and as

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,219
you can see the other conditions and one

35
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,719
of the things that's very important to

36
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,519
understand is that many of these

37
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,500
conditions have an underlying root cause

38
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,349
of endocannabinoid deficiency or

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,989
dysfunction some of the literature is as

40
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:44,099
bearing out that these children clearly

41
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:45,298
have an endocannabinoid deficiency and I

42
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,519
know there's going to be a talk on

43
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,618
autism but just in March of this year

44
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,789
Stanford University published a paper

45
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:55,680
where children with autism had

46
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,170
significantly lower Ananda mite levels

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,689
when compared to children who were what

48
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,310
we call neurotypical so when a child is

49
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:04,649
missing a compound in their brain that's

50
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,109
supposed to promote homeostasis

51
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,500
I consider it malpractice not to correct

52
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,500
that imbalance

53
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,909
here rationale for use again evidence of

54
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:21,209
the endocannabinoid system is root cause

55
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:23,549
despite a recent very recent just this

56
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,810
past Thursday there was a article

57
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,520
published in New England Journal of

58
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,469
Medicine about medical marijuana for

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,770
chronic pain and there was a pro and a

60
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,659
con and the con said we don't know the

61
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,850
safety baloney we know the safety

62
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,789
account of his ins of years show me the

63
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:42,030
bodies we don't see that

64
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:43,769
so certainly tolerated well by most we

65
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,270
don't see organ damage the only time I

66
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,980
really get concerned is when it's

67
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,409
combined with certain pharmaceuticals

68
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,419
especially in children with epilepsy no

69
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,849
question that the quality of life of

70
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,769
these children are being improved if

71
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,599
they respond and we do see like around

72
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,710
an 80 percent response rate which is

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,870
pretty good

74
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,420
certainly compassionate care end of life

75
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,159
now that we have tested medicine and

76
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,839
there has always been tested medicine it

77
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,729
just wasn't required here in California

78
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,599
but now everything that's on the market

79
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:14,699
is pretty is is compliant with testing I

80
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,789
don't have to worry anymore I can get a

81
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,079
batch result and I can see what is in

82
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:21,419
the compounds that the families are

83
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,800
using and most importantly with cannabis

84
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,039
medicine it's not a one-size-fits-all

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,530
you can customize treatment I will share

86
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,729
with you these are two children the

87
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,710
little boy on the bottom these are

88
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:34,799
siblings by the way and the mom sends me

89
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:36,689
these nice little milestone updates the

90
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,550
first day of first grade for Casey on

91
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:40,469
top and her brother started third grade

92
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,050
these are both children with epilepsy

93
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:46,229
and autism they had terrible quality of

94
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,570
life they're both on different regimens

95
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:51,509
and both as you can see are in school

96
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,750
and they look pretty happy doing really

97
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,750
well

98
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,449
I had this really cool animation where

99
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,479
when I click the button the little

100
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,969
circles came up but I lost that when I

101
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,879
converted this to a PDF so what I'm

102
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:08,069
using in in terms of cannabinoids for

103
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,069
patients is I am using everything that

104
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,949
is circled so I am using CBD extracts

105
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:16,858
THC extracts the raw cannabinoids THC a

106
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:19,108
CBD a we're also using just newly

107
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,238
available Delta eight THC for some

108
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,089
teenagers with anxiety

109
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,189
so all of these and and by the way some

110
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,689
other compounds are available CBN which

111
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,250
I haven't really used very much I

112
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,850
haven't found very good success maybe

113
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,430
other people have th CV is now currently

114
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,590
available in California access to all

115
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,900
the different cannabinoids is extremely

116
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:43,319
important I have some patients on five

117
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,638
different extracts a day multiple times

118
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,668
throughout the day some people take

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,439
certain cannabinoids in the morning and

120
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:52,620
some take at night but without the

121
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,899
ability to customize or to have these

122
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,939
available and you know I often get asked

123
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,250
to talk to families who are out of state

124
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,569
if they don't have access sometimes we

125
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,439
really can't get anywhere with a

126
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:06,540
condition so let's talk about CBD

127
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,779
extracts as dr. Michelle mentioned this

128
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,010
morning of course anticonvulsant and

129
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:12,989
that's been borne out in multiple

130
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,728
studies now we also know that CBD

131
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,100
extracts can help with anxiety and

132
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:20,819
aggression and si be a self injurious

133
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:24,450
behavior certainly analgesic my own

134
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:26,519
mother is using CBD for severe arthritis

135
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,990
pain that's been very successful for

136
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,709
three years she's been able to not take

137
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,120
any other painkillers neuroprotection

138
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:35,250
even in the patients that I take care of

139
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,949
like the children who may not respond

140
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,379
with a great result with epilepsy the

141
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:43,110
parents still want to continue to give

142
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,639
CBD to their children despite that it's

143
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,439
not lowering seizures they feel that

144
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,029
it's protecting their child's brain and

145
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,800
they're seeing that the child isn't

146
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:53,129
losing memory every time that they have

147
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,740
a seizure we also know CBD to be

148
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:58,680
anti-cancer and in general decreases

149
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:03,060
neuro excitation interestingly remember

150
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,009
CBD is a stimulant in low doses and it's

151
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,449
more sedating in higher doses and of

152
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,329
course this varies a lot of inter

153
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,399
individual variation but I have found in

154
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:13,319
in the autistic population that

155
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,269
sometimes the lower doses actually

156
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,490
aggravate behavior and as we go higher

157
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:19,228
in dose we can actually get an opposite

158
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,629
effect which is a more calming effect

159
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:23,728
sometimes that turns people off they may

160
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,228
try CBD for their child and usually in a

161
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:26,819
very low dose they see their child

162
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:29,158
escalate behavior and then they are

163
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,719
terrified to use CBD anymore

164
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:32,189
but remember these compounds are

165
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,740
biphasic so we're going to see an

166
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:38,519
opposite effect I like to divide the

167
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,430
CBD into two types of compound or kind

168
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:44,579
of categories high ratio CBD to THC and

169
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,410
lower ratio CBD to THC as you can see

170
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,598
I've listed some ratios those are not

171
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,319
the only ratios that we use but that is

172
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:55,889
just an example and the reason I do this

173
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,340
is because I find that people often say

174
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:02,430
oh okay I got some CBD well is it CBD

175
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,679
with a 1 to 1 or CBD like a 27 to 1

176
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,418
because if it's they're going to give

177
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,310
you different effects and you cannot

178
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,408
compare the two of them and if you don't

179
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,300
know what you're doing and you buy a one

180
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:14,668
to one ratio and you go home and you

181
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,319
dose it by CBD and you get stoned you're

182
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,448
gonna be a little bit turned off to that

183
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,150
if you're not looking for that effect so

184
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,129
I do like to categorize at least again

185
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,719
reading labels so that you understand

186
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:27,810
what is in the product that you're using

187
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,970
in children I've listed the five most

188
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,759
common terpenes that seem to be helpful

189
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,860
for both seizures and for autism Lyn

190
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:40,020
Elul pi9 limonene bethe Correia Flynn

191
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,639
and Marcin so raw cannabinoids have been

192
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,189
available now for a number of years in

193
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:48,199
California I find that both of them are

194
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:50,579
anticonvulsant in my clinical experience

195
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,530
anti-inflammatory and also in pediatric

196
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:53,908
patients this list of improvements that

197
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,968
we're seeing which is decreased anxiety

198
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:58,468
and proof focus better speech less

199
00:07:56,968 --> 00:08:01,978
stemming in those children that have

200
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:04,139
autism better sleep better appetite less

201
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,508
aggression this is a picture of

202
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,949
Katherine Katherine came to me many

203
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:09,810
years ago she's one of my first

204
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,689
pediatric patients and when I gave her

205
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,579
CBD because that's what was available at

206
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:16,740
the time we had THC and we had CBD

207
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:20,279
extracts she did terribly she didn't

208
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:23,759
even last two weeks on CBD oil her

209
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,348
seizures were escalated she was on three

210
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,879
medications we thought maybe there's a

211
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:29,009
drug interaction that we weren't

212
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,658
accounting for but her family was

213
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,778
completely turned off to it and they

214
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:35,968
were not willing to even go and move any

215
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:38,490
further with it and about a year later I

216
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,750
noticed her name on my schedule and when

217
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,549
they came in the mom said you know we

218
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,278
tried two more pharmaceuticals and we're

219
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,899
not getting anywhere she was having a

220
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,919
significant number of seizures every

221
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,159
week and

222
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,929
this anxiety related she felt every

223
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,000
seizure coming so we call that an aura

224
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,679
and it would create tremendous anxiety

225
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,500
for her which then created tremendous

226
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,078
anxiety in the family and when she came

227
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,480
back to see me we had some new

228
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:05,549
information about THCA

229
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,560
and so we started her on that and she

230
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:10,528
had about 30% reduction of seizures and

231
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:12,328
complete resolution of what the auras so

232
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:14,278
the mother said the quality of life was

233
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:16,289
tremendously improved and when cbda

234
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,059
became available we added that into the

235
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,849
regimen and right now I'll tell you

236
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:22,859
she's 50% reduced on seizures she's been

237
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,889
able to wean off a very difficult drug

238
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,629
called anthe that's almost impossible to

239
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:29,789
wean off of and she's had no rebound

240
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:31,259
seizures from the weaning and in general

241
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:33,838
her quality life has really been

242
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:38,028
improved and again that's just on rock

243
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,709
cannabinoid she doesn't take CBD or THC

244
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:42,600
alright THC extracts you know I read

245
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:45,689
something about somebody saying that

246
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,019
children of course don't use THC no they

247
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:51,120
do and my practice they do I do find

248
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,310
that there it is an added anticonvulsant

249
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,230
effect for some patients I in fact have

250
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:58,018
one patient who the only thing that

251
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,839
works to stop his seizures is THC if you

252
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,629
are gonna design a drug for a child who

253
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:07,290
may need to be on this medication for a

254
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:09,509
long term THC may develop tolerance over

255
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:11,039
time so it's not the greatest but what

256
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,990
we found with this patient is that we've

257
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,879
got the seizures so well controlled that

258
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,180
we can back up a little bit on some days

259
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,828
skip a dose maybe take a break for a day

260
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,778
and then restart to try to keep the

261
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,689
tolerance down in general though the

262
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:26,939
child has no intoxication intoxication

263
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:29,490
he's at a pretty low dose but it's made

264
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,649
a big difference in his seizures I also

265
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,509
find THC to be very helpful when weaning

266
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,568
the pharmaceuticals AED stands for

267
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:38,698
anti-epilepsy drugs also what parents

268
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:40,588
will tell us and remember if your child

269
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:43,528
has an and amide deficiency or an

270
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:47,310
endocannabinoid deficiency giving THC

271
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:48,838
can help replace that deficiency and so

272
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,879
what we are seeing is improvements

273
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,279
reported in you know focus speech less

274
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,399
stimming better sleep appetite decreased

275
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,500
anxiety I find THC in general to be very

276
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,610
well tolerated one of the things I

277
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,458
explain to every family

278
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,220
is that every person has a sealing dos

279
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:07,469
and what we do is we start extremely low

280
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,300
and we titrate up if you if they see

281
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,100
their child starting to have any kind of

282
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:12,659
intoxicating effects we've now hit the

283
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,980
ceiling dose and the goal is really to

284
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,469
stay under that of course we're not

285
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,289
we're not looking to intoxicate children

286
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,600
so the low concentration products five

287
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:24,449
milligrams per ml and 10 milligrams per

288
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,360
ml everything and basically standardized

289
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:31,140
one ml syringe which is easy to measure

290
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,620
and give to a child I find allows us to

291
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:39,389
explore THC in very low accurate doses

292
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:41,850
with very little unwanted effects now

293
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,889
CBG is fairly new on the market CB G

294
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,528
stands for accountable Jarrell and I

295
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:48,449
have to thank a group called whole plant

296
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:50,129
access for autism and theirs they have a

297
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,690
poster and a booth so definitely check

298
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:53,399
them out I'm on their advisory board

299
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,040
there's a non-profit group that helps

300
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,528
families with autism there's over 8,000

301
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,208
families involved with them they pointed

302
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:02,578
out to me that CBG was out on the market

303
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:05,189
and there were some families using it so

304
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:06,659
I delved into the research and I'm not

305
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,610
going to go through it all since time is

306
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,559
limited but if can take a picture and

307
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,839
then take a look at these articles but

308
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,838
what's interesting is that CBG appears

309
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,360
to work at different mechanisms then

310
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:21,089
excuse me some of the other compounds

311
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,100
and what we're finding and let me show

312
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,440
you this slide is that they did a survey

313
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,659
of 35 families and as you can see the

314
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,180
dominant effects and these 35 families

315
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:33,299
of children with autism or mostly

316
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:35,120
beneficial so you can see 31 out of 35

317
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,649
and the children have better mood

318
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,019
increase in speech decrease in anxiety

319
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,850
increase in focus increase in social

320
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,490
interaction decrease in hyperactivity

321
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,290
increase in sleep better appetite

322
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,329
decrease in some pain that's kind of

323
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:51,990
amazing that when you look at the top

324
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:53,549
half of this graph you can see that the

325
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,610
dominant effects in this particular

326
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:58,799
group of patients is quite beneficial

327
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,120
and what we're finding with CBG is it is

328
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,569
an antidepressant anti-anxiety

329
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,850
definitely changes mood also works as an

330
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,520
analgesic and anti-inflammatory so I

331
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,019
have started using this in patients many

332
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,000
of the patients are combining it with

333
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,480
other cannabinoids and again I mentioned

334
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,480
this yesterday

335
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,110
at Q a that I attended in that

336
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,089
combination cannabinoids seems to be

337
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,970
very helpful for these children who have

338
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:27,610
such devastating illness in terms of

339
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,160
dosing CBG it appears to be fairly low

340
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,678
dose between 2 and 20 milligrams per day

341
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,299
it can be stimulating for some so some

342
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,860
of these patients are only doing it in

343
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:38,229
the morning because if they take it in

344
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,879
the evening they will stay up all night

345
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,610
which is of course opposite of what

346
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:44,470
we're interested in and there is a

347
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,749
report of a young adult that was shared

348
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,540
through me through this Facebook group

349
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:51,519
who had Tourette's syndrome and he

350
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:53,078
decided to try low doses all the way up

351
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,509
to about a hundred milligrams and he

352
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,938
found that he had complete resolution of

353
00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:01,688
his tics between 25 and 40 milligram

354
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:04,088
dose so it's very interesting in that in

355
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:05,409
my experience with most patients with

356
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,990
Tourette you have to have a fair amount

357
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:10,299
of THC and he does supplement with THC

358
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,159
but in this way he might be able to use

359
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:17,139
both so he doesn't have to take as much

360
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:28,088
THC and so I got through it so I have

361
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:30,818
plenty of time for questions go ahead

362
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:33,879
good morning dr. goldstein thank you for

363
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:35,618
your work and your presentation is there

364
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:39,220
a suppository of information that helps

365
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:42,040
with Pediatrics weaning from certain

366
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,740
synthetics other sort of pharmaceutical

367
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,629
drugs or are you finding it more just

368
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,198
specific to specific diseases that

369
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:51,789
you've spoken about so in Pediatrics the

370
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:55,359
the drugs that were mostly weaning from

371
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:58,568
our anti-seizure drugs or sometimes the

372
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,178
children are taking either abilify or

373
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:02,678
respiratory

374
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:05,259
all of these drugs are usually very

375
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:06,698
difficult to get off of in general and

376
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:08,110
what I've learned is that you know

377
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:11,318
different doctors learn different things

378
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,789
there's no one absolute way in fact one

379
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:16,389
of my friends who's a neurologist said

380
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:17,678
he was taught a certain way in one

381
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:19,329
program and then he went to another

382
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:21,308
program and they taught him a different

383
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:24,458
way to do it so I do think it's really a

384
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:25,289
physician's preference in general I tell

385
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,729
patients

386
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:29,069
if they're especially if they're doing

387
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,330
well with cannabis medicine not to go

388
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,070
fast don't rock the boat

389
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,620
once we're actually seeing some good

390
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:37,230
results so I tell patients to to wean

391
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,269
ten percent or less over a period of

392
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,909
somewhere between two and four weeks to

393
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:44,009
do it slowly especially as we move up on

394
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:46,559
the cannabinoid treatment we can kind of

395
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,029
go slowly down there's no reason to rip

396
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,399
away drugs from a child who's actually

397
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:53,149
finally got some stability that's my

398
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,620
approach anyway okay thank you sure

399
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:57,959
two minutes remaining hi there my

400
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,580
question is about the CBG I know that

401
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,590
yesterday at the CME

402
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:07,860
talks that we had cannabinoids were

403
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:10,399
suggested in place and without THC so to

404
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,830
speak or for those that have

405
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,370
schizophrenia or bipolar and on that

406
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,830
slide CBG seems that it was also a

407
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:21,750
possibility for improvement of

408
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:25,320
antidepressant and anxiety do you have

409
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,000
any negative side effects for CBG with

410
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,340
schizophrenia or bipolar that you know

411
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,950
of right now so I haven't I've only

412
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,500
treated one bipolar patient with CBG who

413
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:37,470
was already a patient doing well on a

414
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,600
CBD dominant oil when we added in CBG

415
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,950
she felt that it was actually helping

416
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,360
her more in combination in terms of

417
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,220
complete elimination of the ings like

418
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,800
kind of paralyzing anxiety that she

419
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,660
still had breakthroughs with I have not

420
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,299
treated anybody with schizophrenia with

421
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:57,029
CBG but I certainly think it would be

422
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:59,849
interesting to try was that patient on

423
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:01,319
any antipsychotic medications now it

424
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,659
went on a patient who had already weaned

425
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,320
off all pharmaceuticals and was doing

426
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:11,279
well on cannabis thank you we've got ten

427
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:15,509
seconds body in your regimen and dosing

428
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:18,990
recommendations to children in your THC

429
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:22,109
verses THC acid one minute a how do you

430
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,209
really go about determining that spread

431
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:26,759
between the acid part and the THC

432
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,950
molecule right so you know there's a

433
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,509
huge inter individual variation

434
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,910
everybody responds differently

435
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:34,950
so in general I use the same kind of

436
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,259
motto that everybody uses which is start

437
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,799
low and titrate up and of course

438
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,859
remember this is out of pocket

439
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,089
Edinson and can be quite expensive so

440
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:45,250
what we're trying to do is find the

441
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:47,829
lowest dose to give the desired effect

442
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,900
so pretty much with THC I'm starting

443
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:52,839
usually at a half a milligram to a

444
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,790
milligram per day or per dose depending

445
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,349
on the condition and for THC a I would

446
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:58,149
say it's probably 2 milligrams or

447
00:17:56,349 --> 00:18:00,699
sometimes even under that for a patient

448
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,460
with epilepsy thank you very much you're

449
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,759
welcome thank you everybody

450
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,759
[Applause]
