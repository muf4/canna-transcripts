2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,200
I'm excited to talk with you today about

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,278
this wearable EEG technology that your

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,118
team has developed to measure the

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,960
effects of THC in the user's brain so

6
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,399
let's start with what inspired you to

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,480
develop this

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:31,159
technology yeah thank you um so er I

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,200
think I was thinking about uh about this

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,359
the other day and the the main

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,160
inspiration to build this technology was

12
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:43,359
in 2016 when the Canadian government was

13
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:46,359
in the process of legalizing a

14
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:50,079
recreational Cannabis consumption and

15
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:52,799
the lack of a test to

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,558
objectively determine if a person is

17
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,479
cannabis inert or

18
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:00,439
not at that time we were building this

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,398
technology to detect drowsiness and

20
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:06,359
while driving and we wanted to help

21
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:10,239
truck companies to keep their drivers

22
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:14,000
alert so they were telling us about this

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:17,359
um upcoming legalization of cannabis

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,719
consumption for non-medical purposes and

25
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,118
that they didn't have a way of detecting

26
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,599
cannabis impairment and that the current

27
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,200
way which is

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:30,919
analyzing and detecting concentration

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:34,719
levels of thhc in saliva urine blood or

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,680
breath there didn't exist a test to

31
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:41,640
analyze the brain of of drivers so we

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,640
were like okay that's the aha moment

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,879
when we decided to Pivot from detecting

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,599
drowsiness while driving to detecting

35
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:55,798
cannabis impairment while driving and in

36
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:59,000
that way help uh multiple markets to

37
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,079
better determine if a person is or not

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,280
impaired because that the biggest the

39
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:08,439
biggest issue the we we we all know very

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:11,640
well that THC remains in body fluids uh

41
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:14,479
for many hours days or weeks post

42
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:18,079
impairment or experiencing the its

43
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,518
effects and and that that leads to

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,840
inaccurate determinations about being

45
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,920
impaired so that was the main reason

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,000
that inspired us to to build this

47
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:31,839
technology and once we build it we

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,360
realize that that

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,280
the the need for this type of brain wave

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,200
analysis was even bigger and Beyond the

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,840
the safety and law enforcement

52
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:48,799
applications and that other application

53
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,360
was for research to better understand

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,560
the effects and the quality and efficacy

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,239
of all of these Innovative products and

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,199
you know breeds and strains that the

57
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,319
market is developing and uh that's how

58
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:08,359
all started wow okay so so really to

59
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:13,119
start it was to try to determine how

60
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,440
impaired a driver was yes exactly the

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,120
the the Ontario brain Institute and the

62
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,199
Ontario Center of innovation two two

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,719
Ontario uh government organizations

64
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,238
fully funded us to to to develop this

65
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,400
technology and that's how we were able

66
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,200
to build it because I hope you will

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,039
appreciate then your audience will

68
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,919
appreciate that in

69
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:40,438
2016 nobody really but not many were

70
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:43,119
familiarized and and Believers of the

71
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:46,400
potential of artificial intelligence

72
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,759
specifically when it's applied in brain

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,560
data and so the government was the one

74
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:57,519
that believed in this you know potential

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,360
Grazy opportunity to you know compl the

76
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,599
current investigation process of

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,439
cannabis imper driving determination and

78
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,280
they were the ones that funded us to to

79
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:11,878
build this technology build it to a

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:15,120
commercially L level kind of a uh yeah a

81
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:17,478
level of commercial VI viability and

82
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,120
then conducting independent trials to

83
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:26,159
prove that AI can do this type of brain

84
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:29,319
wave analysis at a way faster and more

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,400
cost effective way and accurate than a

86
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,279
new Ro ologist or neuroscientist doing

87
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:37,239
it individually or manually right so so

88
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:39,799
that's how all started oh so interesting

89
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,478
so it's an AI component as well

90
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,720
absolutely that's the the the main

91
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,639
differentiator and the uniqueness of our

92
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,120
approach by the way because EEG

93
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,720
technology is not really new it has been

94
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,000
used for more than 100 years but in the

95
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,840
medical space neurologist

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,240
neuroscientists eag technicians

97
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,638
certified EG technicians have been using

98
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,720
it for you know more than 100 years the

99
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,519
problem is and in fact we we came to

100
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,919
this conclusion and realized that that's

101
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:18,359
the main reason why EEG technology has

102
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:21,038
been inaccessible to several Global

103
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,919
non-medical markets because when you

104
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,800
require a neurologist and neuroscientist

105
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:29,839
and EG technology is built for medical

106
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,639
applications it becomes very expensive

107
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:36,599
very complicated to use very slow and

108
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,478
that makes it not commercially viable

109
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,080
for all of these type of markets that

110
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,560
are also conducting some type of human

111
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,478
research not necessarily clinical or

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,680
therapeutic but is more about

113
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:53,279
understanding what is the state of being

114
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,199
of individuals to make better decisions

115
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,638
in terms of safety you know law

116
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,400
enforcement product testing product

117
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,400
quality testing ET

118
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:17,900
