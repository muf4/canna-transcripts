1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,120
thank you very much

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,670
by thanking the organizers for this

3
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,528
opportunity to talk to you today the

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,230
research that I'll talk about has been

5
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:24,109
jointly funded by a company in British

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,449
Columbia Agreement botanicals as well as

7
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:28,038
the Natural Sciences and Engineering

8
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,579
Research Council of Canada which is

9
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,550
enteric federal granting body as well as

10
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,350
SFU Simon Fraser University those of you

11
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:37,459
that need to contact me after the talk

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,689
or through email

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,670
punjah at SFU dot CA so what I'd like to

14
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:45,649
do is talk about some diseases of

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,350
cannabis diseases that have been

16
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:50,179
previously unreported and review some of

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,489
the moles that can get onto cannabis

18
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:54,710
product and assess some potential

19
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:56,419
disease control methods any licensed

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,189
producer any grower is going to

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,960
experience some form of disease or mold

22
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:01,698
and it's important that we understand

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,920
what they are and what we could do to

24
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:05,629
manage them this work was done in Canada

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,359
but all of the results I think are

26
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:12,079
applicable to any state or region that

27
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,670
grows cannabis so what am I going to

28
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,590
talk about I'll start with the root rot

29
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,409
and crown rot diseases those of you that

30
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,180
are familiar with these Latin names

31
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:21,979
Fusarium and Pythium and then I'll move

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,990
on and talk about botrytis which is a

33
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,600
major disease as well as a Penicillium

34
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:28,699
disease and then a few of the molds that

35
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,839
can get on to cannabis product and then

36
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,060
finally I'm going to end with a

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,670
discussion on powdery mildew which is a

38
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,799
major disease around the world we

39
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,469
conducted sampling in indoor and

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,060
greenhouse facilities very limited field

41
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:43,579
production of cannabis in Canada it's

42
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,990
mostly hemp and so my work is limited to

43
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:50,629
a greenhouse and indoors so in Canada

44
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:52,699
probably the most largely expanded

45
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:55,729
industry in cannabis is in greenhouse

46
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,189
we've got growers that previously grew

47
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,420
tomato peppers cucumbers that are

48
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,730
switching over to cannabis production

49
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,420
you can see the highly intensive

50
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:07,189
production system here in this slide

51
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,050
there is also indoor production mostly

52
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:11,419
hydroponic this is an old production

53
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,280
system few years back where individual

54
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,889
plants are in these buckets provided

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,719
with hydroponic solution now they use

56
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:20,389
rock wall blocks which are on raised

57
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:24,379
benches and also provided by hydroponic

58
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:25,939
nutrient solutions so when we first

59
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,539
started this work we started looking at

60
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,688
root system

61
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:31,280
see on your left is a disease or a root

62
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:33,799
rot that causes the Browning of the

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,870
roots and when we isolated from that on

64
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:38,030
your top right is this pretty pink

65
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,430
fungus which is fuse area and on the

66
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,848
bottom is Pythium species that we

67
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,379
isolated from these plants we conducted

68
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:46,938
pathogenicity studies and what that

69
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:49,399
means is that we made sure that the

70
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:52,818
organisms we isolated are able to cause

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,459
symptoms here on your left are is the

72
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:59,000
disease or the symptomology caused by

73
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,670
fees areum and on the right is the

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,009
inoculation with Pythium and you'll see

75
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:06,649
stunting and reduced root growth as a

76
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:09,469
result of these organisms but otherwise

77
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,658
other unless you had a comparison you

78
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,068
wouldn't actually know that these plants

79
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:17,209
were were diseased and that makes it

80
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:18,979
quite difficult for for diagnosis here

81
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,680
again is results from inoculation

82
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,869
experiments on your left are plants on

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
your extreme left is a plant that was

84
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,099
not inoculated with fizz areum on the

85
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,649
right is a plant with fizz erm you see

86
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:33,018
the stunting the yellowing and on your

87
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,780
right is the internal discoloration of

88
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,329
the pith that's due to infection by by

89
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,250
fees areum this is not a wilt fees areum

90
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,040
this is a root in a crown rot fees areum

91
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,318
hence we see the discoloration only in

92
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:50,328
the in the pith and not in the vascular

93
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:52,668
tissue in some cases you encounter fees

94
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:54,560
areum and Pythium together and when you

95
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:56,419
do that you can see that the the results

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,799
were lethal those plants collapse

97
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,019
whether they're in the greenhouse or

98
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,549
under field conditions the photograph on

99
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,620
the right was taken in Northern

100
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:05,989
California those plants completely

101
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,180
collapsed within two or three days under

102
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,989
extreme heat the roots are completely

103
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,269
gone so one of the concerns with fuzzy

104
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,759
arm of course is that the inoculum of

105
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,858
the spores can spread from infected

106
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,959
areas up onto the foliage or onto the

107
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:23,299
flowers and more importantly the

108
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,370
inoculum can move sideways onto other a

109
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,470
Jason plants particularly if you're

110
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,560
growing in a hydroponic system is very

111
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,820
easy for spores to move around in fact

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,180
we saw that when we looked at

113
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:37,009
propagation systems where these cuttings

114
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,540
that were being rooted were actually

115
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,430
damped off by infection by Fusarium

116
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,890
moved through the hydroponic nutrient

117
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,569
solution and on your right you see

118
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,550
colonies of fizz areum that came out

119
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,889
from the hydroponic solution so these

120
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,629
organisms are moving through the systems

121
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:57,169
in greenhouses or indoor production

122
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:58,639
facilities we've also seen cases where

123
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,230
propagated

124
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,419
rooted cuttings that are being sold on

125
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,370
the marketplace actually contained

126
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,259
Fusarium infection you wouldn't know

127
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,240
this from the dark green leaves but you

128
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,339
see the stunted growth in some cases

129
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,170
yellowing and in extreme cases the

130
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,729
plants actually are dead and we're

131
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,170
seeing a lot of movement of these types

132
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,210
of plant materials from one area to

133
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,770
another and that's going to cause some

134
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:24,000
major problems with fees areum in the

135
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:26,339
future the other thing we wanted to look

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,699
at was the growing substrate a lot of

137
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:33,239
the hydroponic growers use Coco fiber or

138
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,560
coconut husk derived substrates and we

139
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,170
wanted to see whether or not these

140
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,019
substrates contain organisms or

141
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,210
microorganisms that potentially had the

142
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,919
ability to spread potentially spread

143
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:49,259
either into the air or onto the flowers

144
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,600
and we were actually surprised this is

145
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,730
cocoa product that hasn't been

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,129
autoclaved and sterilized and there's a

147
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,810
lot of organisms in there particularly

148
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:00,149
organisms such as Aspergillus

149
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,579
aspergillus niger various types of

150
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:03,959
Penicillium species and other types of

151
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,459
organisms this came as a bit of a

152
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,810
surprise to us that hydroponically

153
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:12,989
manipulated substrates such as this can

154
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,910
actually have microbes in them here's

155
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,650
another slide those of you familiar with

156
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,860
moles you know this is aspergillus niger

157
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,569
this is a specialist Arius and again

158
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,009
this is material that comes from

159
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,709
overseas that probably hasn't been

160
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,110
sterilized and actually contains a fair

161
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,549
amount of these pretty awful organisms

162
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:35,400
that have the potential to spread

163
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:37,680
through the plant or onto the flowers so

164
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,289
airborne contamination can be a problem

165
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,689
a spores that are in the air may land on

166
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,910
the flowers they may land on the roots

167
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:47,069
and and after that colonize those

168
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:51,720
particular tissues and potentially

169
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:53,399
result in contamination of product so

170
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,440
what we did is we we devised a

171
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,638
system where we could sample air and

172
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,620
it's a very simple straightforward

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,050
system we take a petri dish with agar

174
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,728
put it out in the greenhouse or in the

175
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,579
growing environment leave it there for

176
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:07,139
60 minutes and bring it back and what

177
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,889
you see in this particular slide are

178
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:15,509
colonies of klaris Boreum colonies of

179
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:18,030
Penicillium there are in the air and we

180
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:20,460
can monitor and quantify the numbers of

181
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:23,279
these microbes in the air and what you

182
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,288
see here this is weeks of flower you see

183
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,888
the blue bars clara ciborium levels

184
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:31,139
start to go up as the plant grows we see

185
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,389
Penicillium levels start to go up and

186
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,100
what this is saying to us is that as you

187
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,500
accumulate plant materials and plant

188
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:41,910
matter these moles start to propagate an

189
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:44,279
increase in the environment this is a

190
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,840
fairly horrific horrific in the sense

191
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,848
when you look at this you realize it's

192
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,098
completely covered in mold this was a

193
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:52,319
plate that was exposed to the trim room

194
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:54,689
and the trim room is where mechanized

195
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,719
pruning or cutting of buds occurs and

196
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:59,819
what we're seeing is a release of spores

197
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,520
from the pine material getting up into

198
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,930
the air and then landing back down on

199
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,168
the petri dishes or potentially on

200
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,259
product and these are organisms such as

201
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:12,180
Aspergillus here as well as various

202
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,769
Penicillium and claryce Boreum species

203
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,150
and this is something that needs to be

204
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:17,969
looked at I think in the future we're

205
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:19,888
confined spaces that are being used to

206
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:24,210
trim product can actually accumulate

207
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:27,150
very high levels of mold so we did some

208
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:29,158
scanning electron micro microscopy and

209
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:32,788
what you see here are the stigmatic

210
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:35,218
hairs that are found on buds of cannabis

211
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:37,588
flowers and you notice the the spores

212
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,659
these are spores of Penicillium that are

213
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:41,820
actually stuck to the surface of the

214
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,950
stigmatic hairs which is one way for the

215
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,110
spores that get into the air to land

216
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:51,720
back on plants and start to colonize

217
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:53,339
those here's a close-up I think it's an

218
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,519
awesome photograph because it actually

219
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:59,220
shows you these Penicillium spores stuck

220
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,049
to the stigmatic here these are about 3

221
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,519
microns in diameter so what that means

222
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:04,259
is that this magnification that you're

223
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,449
seeing here is about a hundred thousand

224
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,360
times so they look large but they're

225
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,860
actually Thai

226
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,360
spores that get onto product and so what

227
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,028
we found is there actually is a

228
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,250
Penicillium but rot these are the

229
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:21,470
Penicillium spores here they are again

230
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,799
and we actually were able to identify

231
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:29,649
Penicillium species on petri dishes that

232
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,649
came from these various production sites

233
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:34,159
these penicillin species are diverse

234
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,990
some of these actually have been

235
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,448
reported by medicinal genomics two years

236
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,680
ago in a study that they conducted they

237
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:41,628
were the first to actually report

238
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,049
Penicillium species on cannabis and

239
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:46,938
we're seeing of a diversity of species

240
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:49,039
Penicillium citroen um here and various

241
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:54,078
other species on product and some of

242
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,789
these are mycotoxin producers boat

243
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,198
riders bird rod is another disease i'm

244
00:09:55,789 --> 00:10:00,469
not going to say too much about this but

245
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:02,299
it certainly as seen here a devastating

246
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:06,370
disease that gets on certain strains and

247
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:09,469
can cause a high degree of devastation

248
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,610
I'm going to finish my talk just to

249
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,680
spend a few minutes and talk about

250
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,659
Prouty mildew that's a major major

251
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,059
disease on cannabis caused by this

252
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:19,219
fungus Golovin oh my sis chicory serum

253
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:21,708
and as most of you know those of you

254
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,449
that grow cannabis will know it causes a

255
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:26,359
white powdery appearance on the leaves

256
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:30,258
on the buds on flowers and it makes

257
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,909
product unsaleable we've looked at this

258
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:34,129
organism again in the scanning electron

259
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:35,990
micrograph and like I hate to use the

260
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:38,208
word pretty and amazing for mold but

261
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,669
this is really quite quite a stunning

262
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:42,768
photograph that shows you the mildew

263
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:44,568
spores actually being produced on the

264
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,909
surface of the leaf a cannabis leaf

265
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:51,528
which causes the white appearance that

266
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:53,568
we attribute to mildew and actually in

267
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:55,909
some cases this mildew has a real

268
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:57,740
preference for trichomes and what you

269
00:10:55,909 --> 00:11:00,169
see here is the mycelium actually

270
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:05,360
coiling itself around a try come on a

271
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:07,849
cannabis bud and here it is again

272
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,938
because cannabis trichomes are sticky

273
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:13,100
they actually attract spores and so

274
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:14,750
we're actually seeing spores to talk to

275
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,000
cannabis flowers because of the resin

276
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,318
that is extruded that causes these

277
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,318
spores to stick to the surface

278
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,439
okay so what are we going to do about

279
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,449
party mildew our objective here was to

280
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,050
screen six biocontrol

281
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:32,920
reduced risk chemical products we ended

282
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:35,659
up looking at these products shown here

283
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:38,509
regalia max Rhapsody which is a

284
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:42,620
bacterial product mil stop potassium

285
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:44,240
bicarbonate Zero tall which is hydrogen

286
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,990
peroxide actinovate

287
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,250
and neem oil as six of these treatments

288
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:54,980
to see what effect they would have on

289
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:56,809
powdery mildew we've set up a very very

290
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,820
good system for reproducing powdery

291
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:00,739
mildew disease we used a strain called

292
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,350
Copenhagen cush which is highly highly

293
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,810
sensitive to mildew they were grown in

294
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,970
these humid chambers for for two weeks

295
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,189
and allowed to develop hardly mildew

296
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,690
infection and then we assessed disease

297
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,280
development and then we started the

298
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,170
applications of the products that i

299
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,539
mentioned to you they were sprayed on a

300
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:21,319
weekly basis for four weeks and then we

301
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:23,240
assessed disease here's what you see

302
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,520
with some of the more effective products

303
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,669
powdery mildew disease spreads rapidly

304
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,889
as you see here within four weeks or

305
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:33,679
five weeks it's reached as high as 40 to

306
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:35,769
50 percent disease various products had

307
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:39,469
different levels of control with

308
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:41,720
products here that are regular and

309
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:45,460
Rhapsody providing pretty pretty good

310
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,460
control of this particular disease

311
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:51,250
here's a representative illustration of

312
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:56,120
the effectiveness of these products

313
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:59,120
control act innovate Rhapsody zero tall

314
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,560
Mills top and regalia now none of these

315
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,570
obviously are completely effective

316
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,789
against disease but remember this is a

317
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,430
highly susceptible variety or strain and

318
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:08,659
so in combination with genetic

319
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:10,669
resistance I think some of these

320
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:12,019
products might be effective the other

321
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:13,669
thing that this slide illustrates is

322
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,220
that we're ready for genetic screening

323
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,870
of cannabis cultivars with strains we

324
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,850
have a method now that will allow us to

325
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,009
look at whether there are any forms of

326
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,180
resistance present in cannabis using

327
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,950
this sort of a system because it's

328
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:27,139
sensitive enough that we can see

329
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:32,480
differences that may be attributed to

330
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:34,129
genetic differences so just to summarize

331
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,170
these results the

332
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:38,750
the two products that are registered in

333
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:40,849
Canada mil stop in xerath all are

334
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,490
reasonably effective in controlling

335
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,110
powdery mildew regalia which is which is

336
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,480
registered in various states in the US

337
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,269
is not registered in Canada but it is a

338
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,620
very good product Nieman Rhapsody were

339
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:54,620
not the greatest they're not registered

340
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,330
at this point in Canada and actinovate

341
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,000
interesting enough which was not a great

342
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,980
product in his studies has now been 2d

343
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,659
registered in Canada for various for

344
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:07,430
various reasons so I think what I've

345
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:08,809
tried to do here is illustrate some of

346
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,209
the important diseases that are

347
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:13,849
affecting cannabis productions in Canada

348
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,889
and elsewhere I try to show you some of

349
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,690
the ways in which these diseases spread

350
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,399
the importance of mold in the

351
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,050
environment that could potentially land

352
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,659
on product whether it's in the

353
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:25,549
greenhouse in an indoor facility or in a

354
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:27,469
trim room and I've tried to show you

355
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:30,139
that some of the major molds are things

356
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,720
like Penicillium and cladosporium that

357
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:35,240
can cause issues later on in packaged

358
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,920
product and we've looked at some ways to

359
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,210
manage these various diseases I've

360
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,919
Illustrated some of the products that

361
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,570
we've assessed there are others that

362
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,370
we'll be interested in looking at to see

363
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,590
whether or not things like powdery

364
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:49,100
mildew and fizz areum and Pythium root

365
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:50,780
rot can actually be controlled so I

366
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,180
think the the need for research on this

367
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,799
topic is obviously critical we're happy

368
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,239
to collaborate with with people on

369
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,159
looking at various types of disease

370
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,210
control methods and I think particularly

371
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,740
for screening for genetic resistance

372
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,330
we're also looking at a molecular method

373
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,860
to see if we can identify some of these

374
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,280
pathogens this is just a straightforward

375
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,560
PCR and it shows you the various disease

376
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:16,699
organisms that are identified with this

377
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:18,289
test phase areum Pythium botrytis the

378
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,930
four species of Penicillium that I

379
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:22,370
talked about Alternaria which is a

380
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:23,719
disease that's just starting to come on

381
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,810
board we haven't seen very much of it

382
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,490
and this is plant DNA this one right

383
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:31,009
here this very unique banding pattern is

384
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,990
partly mildew we can see powdery mildew

385
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:35,929
very consistently using this PCR test

386
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,450
which uses the I TS region three minutes

387
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:40,399
so I think early detection of disease is

388
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,980
very very important because growers can

389
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,949
then manage the the possible outcomes

390
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,420
and I'll leave it at that Canada is now

391
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,600
one week into

392
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:52,759
legalized cannabis production and this

393
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,129
research again was funded by agreement

394
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,750
articles and answer and I thank Darren

395
00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:00,429
and Cameron for the help in this and

396
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,429
this research thank you very much

397
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,470
[Applause]

398
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:09,049
time for questions yes sure thank you

399
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,670
great lecture and incredible images you

400
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:13,399
mentioned them one of the species of bud

401
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:16,279
rot can be mycotoxin producing any of

402
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,379
the powdery mildew no the good news

403
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,480
about party mildew is it's not a micro

404
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:22,279
toxin producing organism so the

405
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,159
Penicillium are probably the most

406
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:28,429
notorious Aspergillus as well as

407
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:31,219
Alternaria there's one report of Kardos

408
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:33,109
Boreum producing a micro toxin but the

409
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,670
big ones are the Penicillium and the

410
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,310
Aspergillus the ones that are in the air

411
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:40,269
that could potentially land on product

412
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:40,269
thank you

413
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,948
you
