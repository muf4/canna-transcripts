39
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,069
at cam at 2018 was an instant hit and as

40
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,169
I mentioned in our conversation

41
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:11,969
Seth was mobbed with questions from

42
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,129
attendees immediately following it I

43
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:15,659
know because I was trying to get an

44
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,000
interview with him and had to wait for

45
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,919
the crowd to clear we dig into some of

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,438
the details of that cam med 2018

47
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,139
presentation particularly the process

48
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:27,209
his team uses to develop unique stable

49
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,829
hemp seed varieties

50
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,050
Seth shares his thoughts on where the

51
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,730
hemp industry is headed as well as some

52
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,760
of the challenges the industry is facing

53
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:37,889
this season I also noticed when I listen

54
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,349
back to the recording that Seth dropped

55
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,959
several references to the year 2021

56
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:44,879
which could offer some hints into what

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,730
the keynote presentation he has planned

hey Seth thanks for joining us on the

117
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:33,519
podcast thanks for having me man I

118

really appreciate it of course and let

00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,060
me say the team's really excited to have

120
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:39,879
you as our keynote presenter for the

122
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:45,459
twenty year presentation at cam at

123
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:46,750
twenty eighteen was a standout for sure

124
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:48,789
and I might have a question or two about

125
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,439
that as I'm a novice when it comes to

126
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,020
plant breeding but I'm still very

127
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,790
interested in it and if others are

128
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,649
interested and I imagine you are if

129
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,819
you're listening but I encourage you to

130
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:01,209
listen to them

131
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:02,560
Seth's kimba 2018 presentation I'll put

132
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:05,799
a link in our show description so you

133
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,410
can check that out but if I remember

134
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,629
correctly and you could tell me but I I

135
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,000
think you were mobbed after the talk

136
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:14,409
with people asking questions and maybe

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,970
handing you business cards which is

138
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,210
always a good sign so we knew we had to

139
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:22,180
have you back as a keynote and that we

140
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:24,759
were sure that you'd have new data to

141
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,590
present so I'm wondering we're dying to

142
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,909
know what is it here looking to present

143
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:34,000
at cam in 2020 this year most definitely

144
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,820
mobbed it was fantastic to get that kind

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,339
of response from folks I think in a lot

146
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:40,959
of ways what what we're doing up here in

147
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:43,719
Oregon and I there's other folks around

148
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,959
the world that are engaged in this in in

149
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,970
similar levels is us but what we're

150
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,049
doing is really dramatically different

151
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:54,400
from from previous cannabis breeders and

152
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,790
the things that we've been lucky enough

153
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:02,009
to uncover both on a phenotype and chemo

154
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:05,260
type and now even genotype level is just

155
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:07,120
distinct right it's different from from

156
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,610
what's available and we're continuing to

157
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,560
push that forward so this year we're

158
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,930
really excited to be able to talk about

159
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,300
some of the breeding projects that we're

160
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,730
working on obviously both the collection

161
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,790
of the few phenotype data chemo type

162
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,020
data genotype data we're gonna give you

163
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,090
a little bit of an update on our

164
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:27,399
collaboration with Oregon State

165
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,929
University and how that's going there's

166
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:33,239
a number of very interesting fronts

167
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:35,350
there we're going to look at some larger

168
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,150
population genomic studies that were

169
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:41,770
engaged in both remember when when Kevin

170
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:44,709
was on talking about his presentation

171
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:46,359
the euro fin snip chip we're

172
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:49,299
participating in that with some of our

173
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,129
some of our f2 varieties along with some

174
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,270
some competing approaches that are

175
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:57,430
really looking at identifying structural

176
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:59,169
variants that are present in the

177
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,030
cannabis genome and specifically

178
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,980
structural variants between individuals

179
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,989
within the population is that seems to

180
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:09,160
be where a lot of the the most

181
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:14,439
interesting interesting examples pop up

182
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:17,020
in terms of new new genotypes that

183
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,779
express new chemo types and new

184
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:22,329
phenotypes that are much much more

185
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:24,489
acclimated for specific types of

186
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:26,349
production so we're really excited to be

187
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,519
able to share the findings so obviously

188
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,820
we're still in the process of gathering

189
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:34,169
all that information but we think that

190
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,950
it's going to be a significant

191
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,659
revolutionary shift and the way that

192
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,759
cannabis is produced based on a lot of

193
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:43,799
the results that that US and others are

194
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:46,360
collaborating on finding excellent now

195
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,059
are you still very much at this stage

196
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,230
looking for

197
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:54,969
you said variations is it in regards to

198
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,730
you know cannabinoid expression terpenes

199
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,950
and sort of potency sort of things or

200
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,840
are you looking also at you know actual

201
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,180
plant structure or drought resistance

202
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,170
and things like that all of the above

203
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:11,019
yeah it again any good breeding program

204
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:12,759
you know you really have to narrow in on

205
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:15,250
things that are really really critical

206
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:16,809
for specific projects so I would say

207
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,419
that the answer to that depends on the

208
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:21,159
project that we're working on but we do

209
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:25,240
have some some awesome trials going on

210
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,709
with OSU over the summer we've got 10 12

211
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,529
different states as of this afternoon

212
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,690
that are engaged in a multi-state land

213
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:34,110
grant University variety trial to be

214
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,420
able to assess what kind of

215
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,060
differences emerge in different

216
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:41,909
ecosystems whether it's from flower

217
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:46,078
timing to disease resistance to water

218
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:47,789
usage number of other trials going on

219
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,049
here in the western United States

220
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:51,569
specifically focusing on water

221
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:53,609
consumption that stuff's all really

222
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,930
interesting but I think some of the the

223
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,829
biggest breakthroughs that we're going

224
00:09:54,929 --> 00:10:01,109
to be looking at for 2021 are really

225
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:04,439
coming down to chemical chemical data

226
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,389
and chemical changes in the plants as

227
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,550
you're probably well aware that the USDA

228
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:13,230
has made it fairly difficult for

229
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:15,929
industrial hemp farmers to continue to

230
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:19,680
grow large fields of cannabinoid rich

231
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:21,750
plants specifically CBD plants in part

232
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,609
due to the underlying genetic

233
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,208
predisposition of the CBD a synthase to

234
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,399
produce some residual THC but we have

235
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:32,369
actually figured out a way to basically

236
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,769
get around that and we've got some

237
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:40,159
wonderful wonderful plants that are very

238
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:44,669
very rich in cannabinoids CBD a CBD VA

239
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:46,198
CBCA and have great olfactory

240
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:48,028
characteristics as well so these are

241
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:50,639
these are plants that have wonderful

242
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:52,439
terpenes and other compounds that are

243
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,370
responsible for making the plant smell I

244
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,930
think this is going to be something that

245
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,379
everybody comes to understand a little

246
00:10:54,929 --> 00:11:00,239
bit better in 2021 but yeah we're really

247
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:01,860
excited about these these new chemo

248
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
types and being able to get them into

249
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,100
farmers hands to allow them to continue

250
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,629
successfully producing low-cost

251
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,389
cannabinoids for the public and now

252
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:17,458
oregon CBD is specifically focused on

253
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:20,519
hemp correct yeah I mean here I and I

254
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:22,739
saw the in your list of questions that

255
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,750
this was going to come up and I'm my PhD

256
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,600
is in sociology so I'm gonna just step

257
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:31,049
back and say any dichotomy any sort of

258
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,269
external definition that we place on the

259
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:36,599
cannabis plant is a social construct

260
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:38,570
first and foremost there's more more

261
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,730
similarities between a plant that has a

262
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:44,399
THC ace and face that's active in a

263
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,339
plant that has a CBD a synthase that's

264
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,328
active outside of those genes yes those

265
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,629
two those

266
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:55,169
those two synthases end up determining

267
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:58,100
what's legal in in most countries in the

268
00:11:55,169 --> 00:12:00,088
world however it doesn't necessarily

269
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,389
demarcate an actual difference between

270
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:05,249
plants so everything's cannabis we got

271
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,198
into the industrial hemp space just

272
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,600
because it didn't have the same plant

273
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:11,698
count restrictions that the the THC

274
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,499
production space had and we knew if we

275
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:16,229
wanted to actually breed plants the way

276
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:18,178
that you you need to to move this crop

277
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,938
forward you're gonna have to have really

278
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:23,488
really large numbers access to an actual

279
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:24,748
bank account relationships with

280
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:27,420
universities and other other

281
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:30,239
institutions and that was that was

282
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,588
really the way to move forward so when

283
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:33,269
you say that the way that you're doing

284
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,920
breeding is different than kind of

285
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,568
traditional breeding that's going on in

286
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,219
the cannabis space is that what you mean

287
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:40,649
that you're able to do it at this large

288
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,920
scale and and kind of do it the proper

289
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:45,989
way yeah and when we say proper way not

290
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,149
just scale so obviously with any type of

291
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:49,829
information that the larger your sample

292
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,668
size is the more accurate your your

293
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:55,318
under lighting data is in our case we

294
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:58,139
were really bucking the trend and this

295
00:12:55,318 --> 00:13:00,328
is that it's present in the THC breeding

296
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,789
side and I won't say that all THC

297
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:04,498
breeders are doing this but because it's

298
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:06,088
illegal and it's essentially still an

299
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:07,439
underground activity even for the folks

300
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:10,860
that are operating in state legal

301
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:13,409
production programs there's always you

302
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,149
know the the overhang of federal

303
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:16,798
interference which means that you can't

304
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:18,028
run huge huge numbers and you have to

305
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:21,418
focus on some very specific

306
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:23,698
characteristics you also don't have the

307
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:26,188
you know that the freedom to do five

308
00:13:23,698 --> 00:13:28,109
generations of inbreeding with a

309
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:30,118
specific variety before you out cross it

310
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,298
to create your your field-ready versions

311
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:34,949
so in that in the THC side of things a

312
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:37,499
lot of times you see people that are

313
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:40,078
taking Sour Diesel and crossing it with

314
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:43,889
purple kush and the resulting plant is

315
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:46,668
purple diesel or sour cush or you know

316
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:48,989
whatever it happens to be but in reality

317
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:51,749
you know that the offspring of those two

318
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:53,819
plants well you're gonna end up with you

319
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:55,379
know maybe one out of twenty phenotypes

320
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:56,878
it's just amazing and great for

321
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,798
production you know and you can clone

322
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,139
that and then grow your small canopy on

323
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:02,069
the THC side from a breeding perspective

324
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,810
you just created

325
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:11,580
an absolute mess of genes it's it's a

326
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:16,259
it's it's not going to produce a uniform

327
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,660
crop we call it a poly hybrid pollen

328
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,980
shucking is the term used by people that

329
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,870
are that are doing the actual line

330
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,149
breeding and line breeding is difficult

331
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,340
you know it takes years to do you know

332
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:28,409
the average development cycle for one of

333
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,360
our varieties is about three years and

334
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,370
that includes you know from the time

335
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,759
that you actually identify your standout

336
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:38,159
in a in a population to embracing it in

337
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,620
isolation tents self pollinating

338
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,089
repeatedly for generations and testing

339
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,830
each one of those generations to figure

340
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,210
out which plants have the traits that

341
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:50,820
you're looking for both from a chemical

342
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:52,920
being a typical and now genotypes as

343
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,540
well making sure that you're getting

344
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,879
what you want and then once you've

345
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:58,620
identified ten to twenty standouts you

346
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,490
know four or five generations into that

347
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,769
process you then outcross and perform

348
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,740
field trials and those field trials are

349
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:10,649
where you actually get to see which of

350
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,570
your inbred population which of your

351
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:15,419
inbred plants ends up producing the best

352
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,250
field production populations so we end

353
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:19,199
up you know in a situation like that we

354
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,360
may think we have twenty amazing plants

355
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,340
but in reality we narrow it down to one

356
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,960
or two that ends up becoming a

357
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,790
production plant we throw away 99.9

358
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,769
percent of what we start with and that's

359
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:33,899
a that's a different situation I think

360
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:36,360
most of the folks in the the THC world

361
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,240
are accustomed to that's gonna be

362
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,269
heartbreaking in a way you know

363
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,519
sometimes progress requires death it's

364
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:49,019
that the plant Raiders on staff we are

365
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:53,699
it's it's so funny we all obviously

366
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:56,549
deeply deeply love plant life in

367
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,590
particular but at the same time we know

368
00:15:56,549 --> 00:16:00,209
what our goals are it's sad to cut

369
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,889
plants down but it's also to a certain

370
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,470
extent of relief you know you're you're

371
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:06,929
you're taking the unknown out of the

372
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,759
field for a farmer and replacing it with

373
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:11,729
something that you know is going to be a

374
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,319
stellar performer so it's you know yes

375
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,970
it's sad but at the same time there's a

376
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,910
bit of joy knowing that your actual

377
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,000
making the gene pool better and are they

378
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:23,549
just completely scrapped is there any

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,149
way stacks and stacks and stacks of

380
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:29,938
plants stacks of plants yeah no they're

381
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:32,850
gone they're done we obviously we stored

382
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:35,818
there we store DNA to go back and figure

383
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,790
out you know hey what was what was wrong

384
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:41,219
with this particular phenotype genotype

385
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:45,778
genotype etc but no we we literally just

386
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:47,670
we compost them okay now I want to step

387
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:50,129
back a bit because you're kind of

388
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:53,128
talking about your process of you know

389
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:54,720
taking a creating a new variety and

390
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:59,278
you've had a a great slide about

391
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:02,399
this in your presentation in 2018 but

392
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,490
I'll fully admit I got a little lost so

393
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,779
I don't know if you've gotta help me so

394
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,808
so you start with your to parrot lines

395
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,548
and you get your F ones take me through

396
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:13,439
there from there because there are some

397
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:14,908
terms like bat crossing and cell thing

398
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,709
that I'm just not familiar with but I'd

399
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:19,439
really like to try to kind of understand

400
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:21,630
the process here yeah yeah most

401
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,220
definitely and and on that slide what

402
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:27,569
what I was basically starting off with

403
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,769
were two very diverse parent plants and

404
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:30,720
what it would take to actually go

405
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:33,509
through and identify segregation and

406
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,038
your resulting population the the more

407
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:37,158
common approach is to take two plants

408
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,210
that you think are distantly related and

409
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:41,700
in breed each one of those lines

410
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,990
repeatedly over and over and over until

411
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,580
you get to the point where you have a

412
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:50,190
highly homozygous plant it's basically

413
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:51,990
it's homozygous a most critical low sigh

414
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,029
in a way that leads to predictable

415
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,750
phenotypes and chemo types so let me

416
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:56,759
stop you there

417
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,869
so you have the two plants you cross

418
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:03,150
them you have a generation after that

419
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:05,308
you're saying that you're after just a

420
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,110
second let's say you find a let's say

421
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:09,418
you find a plant that has a great

422
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:10,529
chemical profile regardless of where it

423
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,500
came from

424
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:15,210
the next step in that process is to self

425
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,558
pollinate that plant so that plant is

426
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,048
gonna get inbred and then you're gonna

427
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:21,000
pull the seeds off of that plant

428
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:23,158
and you're gonna grow them out and do

429
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,690
exactly the same thing identify the ones

430
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,800
that have the characteristics that

431
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,690
you're looking for

432
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,079
self-pollinate those collect the seeds

433
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:34,380
and basically start the process all over

434
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:38,099
okay to self pollinate you're not

435
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,780
actually crossing it with or you know

436
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,899
crossing it with a sibling or anything

437
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,250
it's it's also through self pollination

438
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,340
that's the quickest way to achieve

439
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,170
homozygosity so what you just described

440
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:53,819
as say--let you know you say you've got

441
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:55,350
a great chemical result in the initial

442
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,109
plant that you have another way to do

443
00:18:55,349 --> 00:19:00,539
that is to take one of your self

444
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:03,449
pollinated seeds and then back cross it

445
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:06,809
to that original mom that had the right

446
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,880
chemical profile we we tend to stray

447
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:11,639
away from that in part because of what I

448
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,140
was describing before the fact that most

449
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,000
of the cannabis varieties that are

450
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:19,710
publicly available are very very

451
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,579
heterozygous so they're they're uh

452
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:26,640
they're a total mess and that self

453
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:30,389
pollination ends up leading to less

454
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,440
variation and a tighter likelihood much

455
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,900
higher likelihood that you're going to

456
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,160
get what you are actually looking for so

457
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,259
to take that and then back cross

458
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,720
sometimes that works to lock in the

459
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,609
trait that you're looking for but more

460
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,680
likely than not with the current

461
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:44,459
population of cannabis its present in

462
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,080
the world

463
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:52,650
you're going to end up with a just a

464
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:54,589
bigger mess okay so where'd we stop

465
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,790
there so we're in the f2 where do you

466
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:59,250
that's where the magic happens to be

467
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:02,069
honest that's in your in your s2

468
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,390
population or your f2 s to is best

469
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:05,849
because then you're not crossing

470
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:08,400
siblings and it's a it's a strict self

471
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:12,299
pollination regime you're gonna find

472
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,480
plants that are they have the maximum

473
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:18,659
amount of diversity that's present in in

474
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,860
cannabis in the f2 population you're

475
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,240
gonna see tall plants you're going to

476
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:24,719
see short plants you're gonna see plants

477
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:28,289
with giant calyxes small galaxies you'll

478
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,839
see a diversity of olfactory compounds

479
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:32,789
that are giving them distinct smells and

480
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:36,750
so just that I don't mean to cut you off

481
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:38,369
but just to review so this is the the

482
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,329
product of that original cross between

483
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:43,019
the two distinct

484
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:45,210
and then that self upon self-pollinated

485
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:47,250
that's creating the FTS that are have a

486
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,140
lot of different varieties do I have

487
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:53,849
that right you can do it that way yeah

488
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:57,000
you can definitely do it that way I

489
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:58,349
guess what I was getting at is do you

490
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,509
from it yeah from a developmental

491
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:01,799
standpoint if you've got a plant that

492
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,000
has the chemicals that you want

493
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,519
generally what you're describing right

494
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,569
now is give you a good example we've

495
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:11,639
we've been working on

496
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:14,970
Varun's CBD v th c v CB CB etc for about

497
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,770
four years now and once we had finally

498
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,690
found some plants that had very high

499
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:20,339
concentrations of the Varens it turns

500
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,620
out that they have really poor structure

501
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:23,909
not great smell horrible flowering time

502
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,429
like they're they're plants that you

503
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:29,640
would just throw away normally but it

504
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:32,880
does have that specific ability to

505
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,470
produce Davern ellic acid so we take

506
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,150
that plant and we cross it to a plant

507
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,980
that has all of the other

508
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,390
characteristics that we want but is

509
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,480
missing the different alloc acid

510
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,980
component and in that f1 then we go

511
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,450
through and we look for the plants that

512
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,519
have the highest concentration that have

513
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,319
the best structure etc and then go

514
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,299
through exactly what you just described

515
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:56,669
yeah guys okay great

516
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,639
alright so sorry I didn't mean to cut

517
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:02,310
you off no no it's it's kind of I mean

518
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,530
you know this is the downside of audio

519
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:05,759
if we had some video on here I'd throw

520
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:10,289
some slides in for you it would make a

521
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,970
lot of sense but right alright so you're

522
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,430
in the FTAs and you're seeing all this

523
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,720
different variation so well then I

524
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,549
imagine that you find the best

525
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,220
performers and then what repeat that

526
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:24,869
process again exactly yeah you in breed

527
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:27,420
those and basically we like to repeat as

528
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:31,349
long as we possibly can one of the

529
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:33,360
issues that we run into is cannabis it's

530
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:36,359
an obligate out crosser it really likes

531
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,279
to out cross to other other plants

532
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:41,459
rather than to itself and in a lot of

533
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,569
cases these plants become sterile fairly

534
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,660
quickly

535
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:47,039
and that in and of itself is a is a

536
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,620
inherited trait and it's something that

537
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,950
we select against at first in our

538
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,279
populations but yeah you basically just

539
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,080
do

540
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,160
as much as you possibly can with the

541
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,990
goal if I mean we've heard this a lot

542
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,600
lately this this notion of flattening

543
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,759
the curve quote-unquote taking a large

544
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,889
you know what would end up being a large

545
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,920
distribution of people and in our case

546
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:10,290
traits and spreading it out so what

547
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,990
we're trying to do with cannabis by

548
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:14,639
inbreeding it is to reduce the amount of

549
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,079
variability that's present that's the

550
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,220
curve that we're trying to flatten

551
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,250
you're trying to create something that

552
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,079
doesn't have variation so that when you

553
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,400
do out cross it you're going to have

554
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:29,220
something that breeds true for very

555
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,960
particular characteristics great so yeah

556
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,740
so explain to be outcrossing so you're

557
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,539
doing all this

558
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,609
this inbreeding to stabilize and then

559
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,809
you say that you do an out crossing what

560
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:38,699
what exactly does that mean

561
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:41,940
that means you're you're actually making

562
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,390
the f1 seed so your true hybrid seed

563
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,820
that will go into a field for farmers

564
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,440
that's like it's the you've done all

565
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:52,019
your homework and now you're doing the

566
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,930
presentation it's out in the world for

567
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:57,960
everybody to see yeah they basically

568
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:01,500
just planting it in the field yeah and

569
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:05,130
and what what's required to make that f1

570
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,650
are two independently developed highly

571
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,590
inbred lines and like I was saying

572
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,210
before you may have like you know you

573
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:14,189
may have twenty plants in one of those

574
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,650
lines it's all seemed great but when you

575
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,590
cross them to make your F ones maybe

576
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,910
they don't perform as well as and this

577
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:23,250
is always the case there's one or two

578
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,380
plants that just outcross exactly the

579
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,849
way that you want them to and perform

580
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,220
better than all of their siblings so

581
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:31,079
yeah two independent lines to create

582
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:36,120
your one line that actually goes out to

583
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:41,159
farmers all right well that's very

584
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:42,629
helpful thank you for that so you guys

585
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,750
are constantly doing this coming up with

586
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,070
new varieties what are some of the new

587
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,859
and interesting ones you've come up with

588
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:51,480
or that you're the new and interesting

589
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,129
varieties that you're excited about what

590
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,640
are they the big ones for twenty

591
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:59,640
twenty-one are all compliant so the USDA

592
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,860
gave us this insane when I was Congress

593
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,600
but USDA is enforcing it this

594
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:06,939
scientifically inaccurate zero point

595
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,619
three total THC concentration limit

596
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,600
there's a lot of questions in the in the

597
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:12,908
industrial hemp farming sector you know

598
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,740
does that mean 28 days before harvest is

599
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:16,570
I mean 14 days before harvest doesn't

600
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,720
mean the day of harvest does it mean

601
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:22,298
final products etc that's been really

602
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,669
difficult for for folks who are on the

603
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:27,339
traditional CBD side of breeding to

604
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:29,380
accomplish we're really really excited

605
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:32,619
in addition to our pure CPG these are

606
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,539
type 4 plants that we've been working on

607
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:37,509
and been in various stages of field

608
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:41,230
trials and public release since 28 2016

609
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:44,230
2017 in addition to those we now have

610
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,929
type 3 plans these are high CBD plants

611
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,278
that even on the day of harvest and even

612
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:51,090
after you've trimmed them and they're in

613
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:54,490
a you know in a store or for sale online

614
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:58,629
they are compliant 100% compliant with

615
00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:00,490
that 0.3 total THC requirement in

616
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,169
addition to having a number of different

617
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,659
unique compounds that I think are going

618
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:06,519
to be really useful for people and

619
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:10,200
enjoyable I think on the on the

620
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:12,788
consumption side as well excellent and

621
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:17,350
how has the season been for you you you

622
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:20,429
mentioned the the farm bill how is that

623
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:23,740
sort of how has that shaped your season

624
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:25,929
I'd hurry up and don't do anything is

625
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,759
kind of it's kind of been the mantra

626
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:29,679
we've been waiting for the FDA to issue

627
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,109
some guidance I know a lot of the

628
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,519
manufacturers of CBD products have been

629
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:36,278
waiting for some guidance from the FDA

630
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:39,009
and that has had a very depressive

631
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:41,609
effect on the entire industry looks like

632
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:43,960
there was some overproduction in 2019

633
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:45,788
you know we were we were basically being

634
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,110
yelled at by farmers across the country

635
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:49,658
for not being able to supply enough

636
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:51,908
seeds for them so we built out of an

637
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:53,590
infrastructure capable of producing

638
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,870
enough seed to supply the entire country

639
00:26:53,589 --> 00:27:00,699
and then the market shrank by about

640
00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:03,819
seventy five percent this year so we're

641
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,288
fine it has definitely been trying and I

642
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:07,028
know that farmers are in a similar

643
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:09,460
circumstance as well mostly because

644
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:12,940
they're sitting on product from from

645
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,440
last year and basically just waiting for

646
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,720
the federal government to give the green

647
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,380
light to to have it out in the

648
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,360
marketplace

649
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:23,270
I think that's going to continue for a

650
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:25,729
little while we do know that that

651
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:28,099
Congress is willing to act to be able to

652
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,929
tell the FDA hey it's time to move

653
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:32,959
forward with with cannabinoids which i

654
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:35,179
think is a very exciting very exciting

655
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,250
moment it's been a long time coming but

656
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:39,500
it's gonna open the door up for other

657
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,778
compounds as well so not just CBD but

658
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,490
but the whole pantheon of cannabinoids

659
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:47,960
including THC to be able to get into

660
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,819
both the food supply and to be

661
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,179
legitimate as something that people can

662
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:55,369
consume now one of the things you

663
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:57,080
mentioned in your presentation it came

664
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:59,898
at twenty eighteen that stuck out to me

665
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:03,500
because I am a craft beer enthusiast was

666
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:07,908
these cannabinoid free varieties that

667
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:09,700
could maybe be used in beer with the

668
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:13,510
terpenes and everything is almost a

669
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:16,069
substitute for hops how is that going

670
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:19,038
really well really well they're they're

671
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:21,889
really neat plants in addition to being

672
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:23,390
useful for beer flavoring which to be

673
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:27,230
perfectly honest you could do with with

674
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:28,970
other other cannabis plants that have

675
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,349
cannabinoids in them as well but this

676
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,079
just happens to get around a lot of the

677
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:37,849
regulatory hoops they're they're really

678
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:39,798
they're really cool they also are able

679
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:43,339
to produce some some other interesting

680
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:45,308
compounds that go along with the the

681
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:48,349
terpenes and the other olfactory

682
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:53,359
components that would be very very

683
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:55,519
useful for basically anti-inflammatories

684
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:58,428
so it's something that we're really

685
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,538
excited about getting out working on

686
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:01,759
improving them for disease resistance

687
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:03,408
and getting them out into the

688
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,000
marketplace the one thing that I would

689
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,760
say though at this point is that the the

690
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,278
hop industry is is fairly small compared

691
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,720
to the cannabis industry so it's it's

692
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:13,009
definitely a niche market but it's

693
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,500
something that we're excited about just

694
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:17,890
from both a craft brewing standpoint and

695
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,630
then the the Union bring bringing

696
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:23,259
bringing hops and in cannabis back

697
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:25,940
together in some really important ways

698
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:30,028
yeah and I know that you had mentioned

699
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:33,759
that hop farming doesn't seem fun

700
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:35,888
that they're just you know 20-foot tall

701
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,589
binds and you have to replant you know

702
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:41,288
20% of all of your your hops every year

703
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:45,359
from downy mildew infections and that

704
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:47,319
kind of problem it's it's hard and very

705
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,469
labor-intensive to be able to get the

706
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:53,200
components from a hop that are a lot

707
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:55,899
easier to do it's a cannabis plant and

708
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,720
you don't have the issues of you know

709
00:29:55,898 --> 00:30:01,750
long-term disease pressure popping up in

710
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,370
your field so it's less pesticides less

711
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,919
reinvestment every year for the farmer

712
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:08,199
and to be perfectly honest cannabis is

713
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,080
capable at this point of producing more

714
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,298
of the compounds that people want from

715
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:17,470
Hobbs then the hops are themselves

716
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:20,440
I know another thing that you guys have

717
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:24,250
been working on is sort of auto flower

718
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,240
varieties or early flowering lines sort

719
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,548
of what's the difference between those

720
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,759
two terms and then I guess a follow-up

721
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:34,119
to that is will photo period crops kind

722
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:38,349
of be a thing of the past I think true

723
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:40,959
photo period crops well should I should

724
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:43,199
hesitate on this they have a place but

725
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,399
you have to understand the underlying

726
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,558
genes that are responsible for flower

727
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:49,599
timing and to be able to identify the

728
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:53,079
variants that will get you where you

729
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,548
want to go in specific places so photo

730
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:57,460
period plants will have a future but

731
00:30:54,548 --> 00:31:00,369
it's it's more about gene stacking and

732
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:04,409
being able to use those to get you into

733
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:06,609
a period where harvest is going to be

734
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:08,799
preferential so a place like Tennessee

735
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:10,750
or Kentucky for example they have a very

736
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,519
wet August in September and then

737
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:15,490
everything just kind of dries out in

738
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,259
early October again with climate change

739
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,138
this is obviously going to fluctuate a

740
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:22,329
little bit but for folks like that you

741
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:25,298
want to have a the ability to harvest

742
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:27,908
early and then also harvest late to

743
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:31,269
maximize the useful usefulness of your

744
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:33,970
space so I think there is always going

745
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:36,278
to be a place for photo period plants to

746
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,659
step back the difference between a auto

747
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:41,210
flower and a photo period plant is

748
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:43,190
one is considered a neutral let's the

749
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,679
auto flower it'll it'll flower under 24

750
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:49,278
hours of light the photo period plant is

751
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:53,119
flowering based on relative day length

752
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:55,398
so what we found so we created the first

753
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:58,939
in North America the first autoflowering

754
00:31:55,398 --> 00:32:01,398
CBD plant in 2016 and created the first

755
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,798
Auto flower photo period hybrids in 2016

756
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:07,069
as well did a bunch of field trials in

757
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:09,589
late 2016 and then again in 2017 to

758
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:12,168
demonstrate the efficacy of combining

759
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:14,749
these two distinct germ plasm lines and

760
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:19,190
what we found was was really interesting

761
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:22,179
and driven home in 2018 even more so

762
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:25,220
when you take these hybrids containing a

763
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:26,778
out of an auto flower gene and a photo

764
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,319
period gene when you take these hybrids

765
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:33,079
anywhere in the country they all react

766
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,848
to photo period changes in exactly the

767
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:36,470
same way at exactly the same time

768
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:39,408
there's some slight variations depending

769
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:41,058
on which photo period gene you have but

770
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:44,239
what it looks like is that these early

771
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:47,749
flowering hybrids you can clone them you

772
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:51,159
can you can maintain them but they they

773
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:55,190
go into flower roughly two weeks after

774
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,929
the peak of summer so early July across

775
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,629
the country all of these these plants go

776
00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:01,149
into flower and what it looks like based

777
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:03,199
on the literature is that this is uh

778
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:05,658
basically creating a little bit more

779
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,609
sensitivity to a shift in red light

780
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:10,159
spectrum so the plants pick up on that

781
00:33:07,608 --> 00:33:11,538
and go into flower so some some pretty

782
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,909
good examples in the literature about

783
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:17,509
mechanisms and other model organisms

784
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:19,700
using these same genes but we just

785
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:22,339
happen to pick up on it and be able to

786
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,139
use this in our hybridization process to

787
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:26,509
be able to create these F ones that are

788
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:29,358
predictable in flower timing across the

789
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:31,999
country and that's a huge advantage to

790
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:33,528
farmers you know what folks figured out

791
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:35,690
after the first couple years is that if

792
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:37,909
you have a plant line that was developed

793
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:40,038
in Colorado and flowers consistently and

794
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:41,239
you know it's done by early October if

795
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:43,700
you take that to a different photo

796
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:46,608
period regime like Florida or Vermont or

797
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,980
Oregon the plants respond in a in a very

798
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:51,428
different way and you'll end up you know

799
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,808
not finishing until December in Oregon

800
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:56,150
so being able to have that predictable

801
00:33:53,808 --> 00:33:58,308
flowering time is a huge benefit to

802
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,290
farmers and one of those great examples

803
00:33:58,308 --> 00:34:02,149
of where more knowledge that gets

804
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,519
generated by everybody who's engaged in

805
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,230
this process in the cannabis space ends

806
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,429
up leading to much better much better

807
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,659
products and better outcomes for farmers

808
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:15,139
and again this is particularly useful

809
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:16,490
for outdoor cultivation which the

810
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,590
correct me if I'm wrong is much more

811
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:24,439
common in the hemp space than the

812
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:28,700
cannabis space and why is that a cost of

813
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:31,220
production it's free sunlight free free

814
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:36,049
soil for the most part the cost of

815
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:38,989
production outside is much much lower

816
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,490
than in the indoor space and it's long

817
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:43,269
to be perfectly honest the only reason

818
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:45,618
why indoor cannabis is still grown

819
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:48,320
outside of producing seed for

820
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:50,990
large-scale farmers on the THC side it's

821
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,690
only because of prohibition as soon as

822
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:55,939
you drop that that requirement and you

823
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,639
know strange requirements like you know

824
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,550
12-foot tall fences or an enclosed space

825
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:04,129
and those sorts of things the total cost

826
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,570
to produce outside just makes it much

827
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,829
much more likely that people will be

828
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,030
engaging in that type of production

829
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:13,779
behavior now so it organ CBD you guys

830
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:17,150
seem particularly focused on you know

831
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:19,160
resinous big buds producing cannabinoids

832
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,019
and terpenoids for you know whether it

833
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:24,679
be supplements or pharmaceutical

834
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:26,358
applications are you guys interested at

835
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:28,929
all in maybe going after the other

836
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:31,699
markets of you know using hemp as a

837
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:34,849
fabric a plastic a fuel building

838
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:37,669
material anything like that yeah very

839
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:39,858
much so although you know the the main

840
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,659
the main take-home message on this is

841
00:35:39,858 --> 00:35:43,369
that other countries because they had

842
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:45,108
legalized industrial hemp ahead of the

843
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:46,789
United States I think they're a little

844
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:48,710
further along and in terms of their

845
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:52,460
breeding programs for things like fiber

846
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:54,949
or seed I think I think that we have the

847
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,990
tools to be able to catch up relatively

848
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:58,939
quickly and some of the things that

849
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:01,519
we're really excited about for 2021 is

850
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,289
being able to introduce new varieties

851
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,538
that can

852
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:08,528
do those things particularly on the seed

853
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:12,359
side for for a consuming seed as a

854
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:14,438
protein source as a basically as a

855
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:17,409
nutritional supplement in and of itself

856
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:21,938
as a food and then also being able to

857
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:24,608
grow your cannabinoid rich crop right

858
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:28,958
next to that and being able to safely do

859
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:31,119
that without having any seeding yeah

860
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:33,239
that was one thing I wanted to ask you

861
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,278
about because I if I remember correctly

862
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:39,639
your you had an Instagram post sort of

863
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:42,278
about being being good neighbors and

864
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:45,788
being careful not to grow male hemp

865
00:36:42,278 --> 00:36:47,349
outside so I was wondering if you could

866
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:51,729
kind of talk about some of the dangers

867
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:53,979
that come with with that yeah if your if

868
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:56,409
your crop gets seated you're gonna lose

869
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:58,509
30% of your overall cannabinoid content

870
00:36:56,409 --> 00:37:00,938
you're gonna lose 50% of the weight of

871
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:02,409
your crop just because the plant is

872
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:03,969
putting all of its energy into seed

873
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:08,018
production rather than cannabinoid or

874
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:11,438
floral tissue production hugely hugely

875
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:13,389
problematic it makes the production of

876
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:15,608
certified seed outside also very

877
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:17,228
difficult number of different issues

878
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,018
that come along with it that farmers

879
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:20,978
really you know at the end of the day

880
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:22,688
they're just trying to grow a crop

881
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:24,848
that's going to make them money and it's

882
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:26,858
going to benefit people and it's it's

883
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:29,709
something extra that they shouldn't

884
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:32,409
necessarily have to worry about we are

885
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:35,228
very confident that in 2021 we're going

886
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:38,979
to be able to release seed lines that

887
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:41,198
make that concern obsolete we've figured

888
00:37:38,978 --> 00:37:43,868
out a way to get around that and the

889
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:47,079
results we're so excited about this the

890
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:48,729
result is I think going to push forward

891
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:53,349
the envelope of what people even

892
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:54,608
consider possible with cannabis it's the

893
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:58,509
early results that we're seeing in our

894
00:37:54,608 --> 00:38:01,688
experiments are the most resinous the

895
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:03,818
most pleasant smelling most vigorous

896
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:06,068
plants that we've ever experienced and

897
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:10,358
we've been growing cannabis for pretty

898
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:13,179
close to 20 years now just amazing

899
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:14,558
evolutionary jumps forward and we're

900
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:15,300
really excited to be able to talk about

901
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:20,250
this

902
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:23,930
in depth at can med 20/20 well that's a

903
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:27,030
great place to stop if I ever heard one

904
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:29,460
but before I let you go I want to give

905
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,500
you a chance to plug your website or

906
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,389
social media or anything where can

907
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,900
people learn more about you and Oregon

908
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:39,509
CBD yeah our website is Oregon CBD seeds

909
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:44,210
calm and we are on Instagram and

910
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:48,510
Facebook as Oregon's CBD were 41 strong

911
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:49,980
scientists plant propagators folks that

912
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,869
are taking care of greenhouses we've got

913
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,480
a great company family owned and

914
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:58,108
operated and we're just really excited

915
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,320
to be providing farmers with quality

916
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:03,239
seeds that they can depend on excellent

917
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,730
like I said where we're more than happy

918
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:10,139
to have you and we're happy to work with

919
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:13,199
oregon CBD where as you know a family

920
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:15,299
operation over here as well and i think

921
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,858
we kind of see ourselves as sort of cut

922
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,890
from the same cloth in the regard that

923
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:21,329
we both try to do what we can with good

924
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:24,239
science and good old-fashioned hard work

925
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:26,250
so again happy to have you as part of

926

testing cannabis flower including

945
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:18,349
sampling bias and the lack of

946
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:20,480
standardized methods Brianna also shares
