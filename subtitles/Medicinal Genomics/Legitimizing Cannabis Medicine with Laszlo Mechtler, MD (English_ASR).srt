59
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,759
how the dent Institute is uniquely

positioned to study medical cannabis for

61
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,719
a variety of conditions results from

62
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,399
recent studies conducted at the dent

cannabis Clinic the challenges of

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,519
studying medical cannabis and how a

65
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,518
proposed rescheduling could help and the

66
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,640
ongoing struggle to convince fellow

being there and meeting uh colleagues

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,560
and uh specialists in this field that

111
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,959

112
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,280
ways so I really um honored and it's

113
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,959
going to be a great pleasure to be there

114
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,079
uh for the next meeting so thank you

115
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,359
again for the invitation absolutely and

116
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,079
I'm excited to catch up with you today

117
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,000
about all the the research and clinical

118
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,758
studies that you and the team are doing

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,800
at the dent Institute because it's

120
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,919
substantial um I think and it's

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,120
important because those who are hesitant

122
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,879
or maybe oppose some of the legitimacy

123
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,079
of cannabis medicine will typically

124
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,159
point to a lack of evidence so it's

125
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,719
vital that institutions like yours are

126
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,880
are doing the work as they say so that

127
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,759
might be a good place to start and if

128
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,959
you would kind of tell the audience a

129
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,280
bit about the dent Institute and and

130
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:02,839
your role there so the dent Institute

131
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,439
was founded in 1960s so before you ask

132
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,598
it wasn't founded by me because that

133
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:10,719
would make me too old but I've been here

134
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,399
close to 38 years I'm the chief medical

135
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,240
officer or medical director of The

136
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,159
Institute we are the largest private

137
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,519
Neuroscience Institute in the United

138
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,160
States by far just to give you a feel we

139
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:27,000
see about 1300 patients every day in the

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,919
field of Neurology uh we're a private

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,560
Institute uh but we

142
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,758
uh work with pharmacological or

143
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,038
pharmaceutical companies we have close

144
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:41,360
to a 100 studies looking at different uh

145
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:44,360
drugs in the field of Neurology uh

146
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,879
everything from Alzheimer's Ms headache

147
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,038
uh stroke uh movement disorders um so

148
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,680
we're very active in our research

149
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,240
component and the pharmaceutical world

150
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,478
knows about us seeing that we're the

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,960
largest Neuroscience Institute uh you

152
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:04,079
know I like to say that in today's world

153
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,918
research is done in academic centers and

154
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,478
people think that the private sector uh

155
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,439
doesn't do academic work we're just the

156
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,959
opposite we're in the private sector so

157
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,199
we're a private Institute run by

158
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,198
physicians but we do a tremendous amount

159
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,759
of research and the farmer world knows

160
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,598
that so that's one of the reasons uh it

161
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,360
was a little bit complicated when I got

162
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,800
got into uh cannabis and you used a word

163
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,800
called uh

164
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,360
legitimate my whole thing is legitimacy

165
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,560
I'm a full professor at the University

166
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,199
and the chief

167
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,319
of of

168
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,680
neuron at a at a cancer hospital called

169
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,120
Roswell Park and the den Institute is

170
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,400
our private Neurological Institute where

171
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,399
uh in every year we see over 310,000

172
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:54,079
patients and uh and uh we uh educate in

173
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,959
fact in my in my room right now I have

174
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,560
uh four or five students from all parts

175
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:02,439
of the world listening uh so we very uh

176
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,280
focused on Research education and taking

177
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,879
care of a lot of people with high

178
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,158
quality care that's what we're about

179
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,360
excellent now when did the dent

180
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,959
Institute get involved in cannabis and

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,120
was that sort of a logical fit for you

182
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:21,158
guys illogical it was not logical in any

183
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,879
way shape or form um only reason we got

184
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:26,839
into it because we take care of so many

185
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:30,240
people so when cannabis was was made

186
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:33,559
legal in New York State uh about six

187
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,879
seven years ago um we were getting phone

188
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:40,199
calls 500 a day I said no I have no idea

189
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,120
about cannabis I've you know I'm not a

190
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,120
smoker I'm not a user I'm not I don't

191
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,720
even use alcohol which makes me

192
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,080
tremendously boring so the the point is

193
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,639
the next day was another 500 phone calls

194
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,440
the third day another 500 phone calls

195
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,639
now if you were on the business you can

196
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,440
imagine how much money and energy that

197
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,679
takes to answer those phone calls so has

198
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,600
said look let's get into cannabis let's

199
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,838
make a clinic let's start learning about

200
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,480
it so because we're you we're um our

201
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,680
business model is so private and not

202
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,759
institutional we're able to set up a

203
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:17,159
cannabis clinic and for the next six

204
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,639
seven years it took that amount of time

205
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,919
to understand the use of cannabis in

206
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,958
patients with neurological symptoms

207
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:27,360
including pain and you know you're

208
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,879
self-taught I mean where are you going

209
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,560
to go medical school they don't teach it

210
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,278
where so so the only good places to

211
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,199
learn is at these conferences and so I

212
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,320
was honored to be you know at these

213
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,600
conferences everywhere from Tel Aviv to

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,000
uh Malta Europe and the United States so

215
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,879
I've been part of this and I've been

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,480
learning as we go and now I feel I have

217
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,600
an expertise because how do Physicians

218
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,720
understand medicine they have to see

219
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,000
patients so right now in the clinic we

220
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,759
have over 13,000 patients on cannabis

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,839
for medical reasons

222
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,919
so I don't deal with recreational and I

223
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,880
need to emphasize that I'm purely on the

224
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,199
medical side I'm purely there to

225
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:11,838
legitimize this whole

226
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,959
process excellent so was there a was

227
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,640
there a light bulb moment or was there a

228
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:18,319
specific um piece of evidence that you

229
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,278
saw that you know kind of clicked in

230
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,800
your head that you know there's

231
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,600
something to this cannabis well as

232
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:26,039
you're seeing

233
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,240
patients as they come up to you and they

234
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,519
throw their arms around you and hug you

235
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,879
that's the changing moment that you

236
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,399
found something where patients said you

237
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:39,799
changed my life you got me off

238
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,320
opioids my quality of life has improved

239
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,479
and With Tears in their eyes they're

240
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,680
hugging you and saying thank you that's

241
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,079
the moment that every physician wants in

242
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,278
their life and I got that in cannabis

243
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,519
interesting enough uh you know I deal

244
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:54,799
with bad diseases I deal with uh you

245
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,639
know brain cancer it's one of my

246
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:00,078
specialties and it's it's you know you

247
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,879
never get that moment so yeah it changed

248
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:06,359
the way I practice uh I still do you

249
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,958
know brain tumor research and treatment

250
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,120
I do uh other things in neurology but

251
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,239
cannabis has been an eye openening

252
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,120
moment where you can change the quality

253
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,799
of life of individuals by understanding

254
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,240
how cannabis works on human

255
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,439
beings great and so now how did the

256
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,799
studies work at the dent Institute how

257
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,760
do patients become enrolled and how how

258
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,679
does that process sort of start so I I

259
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,278
don't have to teach the audience how

260
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,319
difficult it is to do research in

261
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:37,759
cannabis so in the same time I you know

262
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,440
we have every pharmaceutical company

263
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,919
come in here we do phase one phase two

264
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,600
phase three studies I have a whole

265
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:50,120
research team uh uh looking and putting

266
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,480
patients on board for you know these

267
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,879
drugs that we are using for example in

268
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,720
migraines um so cannabis is a whole

269
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,078
different story where do you get the

270
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,079
support who pays for that research what

271
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,919
company so I realized very fast if I

272
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,919
want to do research in cannabis it has

273
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:10,278
to be self-funded init initially we have

274
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:12,559
to do our own research so it that

275
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,879
perspective of being federal legal being

276
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,000
a schedule one drug made it very

277
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:20,519
difficult to do prospective research so

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,958
I'm I'm sitting and I say well let's get

279
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,039
a um schedule one license then I

280
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:29,039
realized back then if I do get a

281
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,919
schedule one one license who could um

282
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:34,078
who could tell me that the Cannabis that

283
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:36,439
I'm using is of high quality uh which is

284
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,198
as we all know initially came from

285
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,600
Mississippi so so uh I decided initially

286
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:47,198
not to get the schedule one license I

287
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,120
decided to uh uh do the following uh I

288
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:51,879
said the initial studies of the

289
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,320
literature were small studies 25

290
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,958
patients 30 patients and the criticism

291
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,680
from the medical community that these

292
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:01,799
are small studies and studies that that

293
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,039
uh are not academically

294
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,000
worthwhile so I said well that's

295
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:10,639
interesting um uh how about if we do

296
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,879
retrospective large population studies

297
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,159
and that may open up the eyes for

298
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,278
clinicians and academic physicians in

299
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,759
that okay we're not talking about 25

300
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,480
patients we're talk about hundreds of

301
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,278
patients and look at them

302
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,320
retrospectively so this so it's popular

303
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:28,879
populationbased research but larger

304
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,879
numbers than what we've had in the past

305
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,240
and so I've had the opportunity to do

306
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:37,559
that in multiple uh Subs Specialties of

307
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:42,000
Neurology everything from Ms Parkin

308
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:44,119
headaches for example uh and dementia uh

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,639
we are looking also at other diseases

310
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,519
like autism periphal neuropathy trial

311
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,399
neuralgia so I'm going down the list of

312
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,919
neurological disorders and then getting

313
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,120
large populations and looking at uh

314
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,599
efficacy and side effect profile which

315
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,399
is very important ratios and dos mage of

316
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,440
what I'm using and uh I put that all in

317
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,120
a data bank that I have of now you know

318
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,880
13,000 patients so so it's been very

319
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:14,198
interesting to do do this type of

320
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:16,480
research and as you know hopefully if

321
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:18,919
this becomes a schedule three drug maybe

322
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,480
things will change for clinicians like

323
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:24,120
myself yeah no I and I definitely want

324
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,159
to to touch on that but before we do so

325
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,879
when you say retrospectively so is that

326
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,480
you're putting patients on uh you know

327
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,240
a course of cannabis medicine and then

328
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,720
sort of checking in with them after a

329
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,639
defined period of time and saying you

330
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,519
know how has it helped you yes exactly

331
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,560
so how do you treat somebody so I'm I'm

332
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,720
looking at patients are not gonna get do

333
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,239
not want to get high the 75 year old

334
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,120
female with rheumatoid arthritis who

335
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,039
doesn't smoke doesn't drink doesn't do

336
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,198
marijuana uh does not want to get high

337
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,319
this is where I have a problem with the

338
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,198
Cannabis world because a lot of uh uh

339
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,800
people think oh all patients just want

340
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:04,559
to get high that's not true yeah I look

341
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,559
at a different population these patients

342
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:10,758
want to be uh cautious they do not want

343
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:14,838
to get high with their grandchildren um

344
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:16,879
uh they want to be cognitively sharp but

345
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,120
they want pain relief they want symptom

346
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:23,278
relief uh so so as I'm seeing these

347
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,600
patients I'm realizing which ratios may

348
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:29,360
work in which age group uh and I have to

349
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,560
be also very knowled ible about what

350
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,399
medications they're taking I mean many

351
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,039
of these patients are at 75 years old

352
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,559
they're on 15 different drugs so you

353
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:40,639
just and they may have asthma so you

354
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:44,198
don't want to give them a vape if they

355
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,519
have asthma and on anti-coagulation so

356
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:47,919
there's things you need to know so

357
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,039
that's why I think it's important that

358
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:54,799
in medical cannabis programs you have a

359
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,318
physician or a physician extender who is

360
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,039
very knowledgeable in how to use these

361
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:02,360
medications treat these patients uh

362
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,480
because and then very important come

363
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,079
back in a relatively short period of

364
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,639
time so you can adjust the dosage you

365
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:12,239
can adjust the titration schedule you

366
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,480
can adjust the ratio depending on the

367
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,278
side effects and symptoms and efficacy

368
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,240
rates so you have to keep an eye on

369
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:19,679
these patients you know in in medical

370
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,440
marijuana programs a lot of people are

371
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,439
seeing that I'll see you back in one

372
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,759
year I mean patients don't want that

373
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,399
they want to be nurtured through their

374
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,959
through this experience see somebody

375
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,958
who's knowledgeable and then they can

376
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,439
see him follow up regularly and when

377
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,758
they get stable then you can see them

378
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,000
later in six months or 12 months right

379
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,159
and so where do you Source the medicine

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,639
are you just sort of giving

381
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,439
recommendations and then they have to go

382
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,198
to the dispensary and sort of get the

383
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,880
medicine themselves yeah in New York

384
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,639
state strict rules so if as a physician

385
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,120
I can't be involved in the business of

386
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:57,278
cannabis so I don't have a dispensary

387
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,120
here for medical marijuana um you know

388
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,639
there are CBD products that I got

389
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
involved with because that's a whole

390
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,439
different world uh you know CBD products

391
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,720
less than .3% THC but in medical

392
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,880
marijana uh we're an Institute so we we

393
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,600
didn't have a dispensary in The

394
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,520
Institute in my area we have three of

395
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:20,279
them and the good news is that after

396
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,439
some initial hurdles initial

397
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,119
difficulties uh they realized that

398
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,400
whatever I want I want my patients to

399
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,079
get that they can't change it at the

400
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,360
dispensary example would be initially a

401
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,399
patient went there uh I gave a tincture

402
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,279
uh it was switched to a vape the patient

403
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,440
ended up in the emergency room because

404
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,599
the the butt tender or whoever worked at

405
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,519
dispensary did not know that the patient

406
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,439
had asthma and so these are just one

407
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,279
example but I work very well with the

408
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,960
dispensaries they they respect my

409
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,960
knowledge and and and and they

410
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,679
understand that I'm adamant if I uh uh

411
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,200
certify somebody for a ratio or dosage

412
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,159
that's what they're going to get get MH

413
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:07,640
great

414
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:09,880
um so you mentioned before that when the

415
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,960
medical marijuana program came on there

416
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,480
was a ton of interest and you were

417
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,240
getting a lot of phone calls how has

418
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,360
that interest changed uh over the years

419
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,880
is it is it more than ever now so yeah

420
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,639
New York State's a big state right we

421
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,200
have over 20 million people at in the

422
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,880
New York State program I myself see 10%

423
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,679
of all patients in New York state and

424
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,120
let's include you know New York City

425
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,360
Long Island and so on so we see a lot of

426
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:38,158
patients and most of them in regionally

427
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,079
some are long distance but they have to

428
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,840
be within New York State they can't come

429
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:47,000
from Florida because you need a New York

430
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:50,558
state license uh so so uh the program is

431
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,079
a little bit rigid it's very expensive

432
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:55,038
but the rigidity of the program meaning

433
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,199
everything has to be tested has helped

434
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,158
me because I know what my patients are

435
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,720
getting uh

436
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,440
it's important me to understand because

437
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,400
when you buy things off the street you

438
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,120
have no idea and you know the literature

439
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,559
has shown that cannabis off the streets

440
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:13,158
has a high incidence of contaminants

441
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:17,200
everything from heavy metals everything

442
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:19,480
from bacteria fungus uh pesticides

443
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,200
insecticides so it's good to know my

444
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,440
patients are getting something that is

445
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,440
uh tested

446
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:31,400
often hence the expense is higher which

447
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,360
is an issue in most medical marijuana

448
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,759
programs so uh uh I'm not sure if I

449
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:39,439
answered your question I went on a

450
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:42,480
monologue which I do some sometimes but

451
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,798
uh you know the good thing about the uh

452
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,640
program is that I like to fact that it's

453
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:53,400
strict um but oh you I thank you you

454
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,919
asked a question about drop off uh so as

455
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,280
you know New York State went for medical

456
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,000
now it's recreational uh has there been

457
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,079
a drop off

458
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,400
uh I would say

459
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:06,199
yes uh I think people feel there's a

460
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,880
it's complicated because in New York

461
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,798
state we have a lot of reservations in

462
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,520
Western New York and under reservation

463
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,879
being Sovereign land they actually have

464
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:19,480
their own cannabis and sell

465
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,360
it unfortunately uh what I've seen is

466
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,240
that what they're getting is not always

467
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,599
what was uh advertised uh and it's a lot

468
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,798
of contaminants and some of those

469
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:32,158
contaminants I've had positive

470
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,038
LSD with people on cannabis who have

471
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,679
side effects and hallucinator and

472
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:39,038
paranoid

473
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,960
reactions so it is changing I I've asked

474
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,919
New York state to protect the medical

475
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,079
marijuana program but as you may know uh

476
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,919
Ben when recreational marijuana comes

477
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:53,480
into a state yeah usually it affects the

478
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:57,120
medical marijuana program so I think my

479
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,919
numbers are down but let's be fair now

480
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,479
I'm seeing patients who really really

481
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,880
are interested in medical marijuana and

482
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,919
don't want it for recreational reasons

483
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,440
right yeah and do you think it's a case

484
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,880
that some people think that they can

485
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,840
sort of self-medicate you know just go

486
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,440
through the the recreational program

487
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:17,240
rather than kind of get a physician

488
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,240
involved yeah I think that's true I

489
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,839
think the younger patients think that

490
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,640
yeah I think the younger you are the

491
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:25,359
more likely that you don't you don't go

492
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,960
to a doctor but you know we have a very

493
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,558
strong um uh presence as an Institute

494
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,000
and as a physician I've been in this

495
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,158
community for over 35 years and so they

496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
kind of know your reputation as a

497
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:45,360
cannabis doctor and so so I think a lot

498
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,960
of patients uh come to me uh and are uh

499
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,479
comfortable with the knowledge set I

500
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,200
will also say one thing that I'm very

501
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,519
different to anybody else so when I

502
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,080
started a program I said I'm not I'm

503
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:59,558
going to legitimize this and I said how

504
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,759
do I legitimize a program where people

505
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:05,119
are making a business out of it let's be

506
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,440
fair a lot of doctors got involved for

507
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,798
the sake of seeing a lot of patients in

508
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,038
a short period of time and billing them

509
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:15,759
$250 cash sometimes 350 not including a

510
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,599
urine test which is another additional

511
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:21,519
money some people were paying

512
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:24,519
$800 on an office visit so I said what

513
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,679
if I don't accept their cash and that's

514
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:27,798
unheard of what do you mean you don't

515
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,840
accept people's cash who doesn't accept

516
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:33,918
cash cash well if you accept cash that

517
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,759
to me is is not a legitimate process in

518
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,640
medicine so I said I'm not going to

519
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,839
accept any cash from any patient who

520
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,520
comes to me for cannabis so I talked to

521
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:45,639
the CEOs of hosp of insurance companies

522
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,480
health insurance some companies uh you

523
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,600
know I talked to them I said look I'm

524
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,038
gon to see your patient but I want to be

525
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,918
the patient's doctor not just giving him

526
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:56,119
certifying for cannabis because they got

527
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:59,120
back pain so I became the treating

528
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:02,038
physician which means that I I dictated

529
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,278
a three-page note for example if they

530
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:06,679
had multiple sclerosis and they have not

531
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:09,240
had an MRI in 10 years then maybe I'll

532
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,759
do an MRI or if they have back pain I

533
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,440
like to know why they have back pain so

534
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:16,720
I wanted to go to the ideology of the

535
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,240
symptom um if they had trial neuralgia

536
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,000
which is pain in the face uh I like to

537
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,000
know what medications you're on maybe I

538
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,200
can adjust it so I want to become the

539
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,119
treating physician for that reason I

540
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,400
build the insurance company and all of

541
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,759
them said yes and I've not had a problem

542
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,278
in six years so when a patient comes to

543
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,480
me they'll have to pay cash at the

544
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:38,558
dispensary but they don't pay cash with

545
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,679
me I'll accept what whatever their

546
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,519
insurance pays and I think you may

547
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,360
understand a lot of these individuals

548
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,000
don't have good insurance because

549
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,038
they've been disabled they're not

550
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,679
working because of low back pain or

551
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:54,319
chronic pain so a lot of what insurance

552
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,200
pays is not a lot but it really doesn't

553
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:59,079
matter at the end of the day I serve

554
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,679
13,000 patients I think we have a very

555
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,359
strong reputation and to me this is

556
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,278
legitimizing the whole process yeah I

557
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:09,959
would say so it's let me just if

558
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:12,558
somebody accepts cash as a physician I'm

559
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,278
not critical of that uh if they do a

560
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,240
good job and not just certify the

561
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,079
patient and Say Goodbye if they really

562
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,599
keep an eye on them then yeah I don't

563
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:25,398
have a problem with somebody accepting

564
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:27,678
cash but at my Institute uh I said no to

565
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:29,079
that yeah no I think you're right I

566
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,038
think there definitely was a cottage

567
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,439
industry that that popped up of just you

568
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:36,278
know writing writing recommendations and

569
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,720
being done with it so yeah I know of

570
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:41,519
people flying in from a different state

571
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,519
and going to a strip mall renting a

572
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,240
office for one day and flying back the

573
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,240
same

574
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,720
day I've heard stories too of of doctors

575
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,159
setting up booths at conferences and you

576
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,798
know you just you just walk up and

577
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,039
they'll write the recommendation for you

578
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:58,359
and just keep keep the line moving and

579
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,679
then initially I know sure if it's still

580
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,918
being done initially then then these 1

581
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,679
1800 numbers these phone numbers that

582
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:06,799
you don't even have to see the doctor

583
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,440
all you have to do is call phone number

584
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:13,319
get certified now I don't I don't

585
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,960
understand that's such a money money

586
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:20,119
Focus way to take care of human beings

587
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,159
um you know I I really feel strongly

588
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,719
that and maybe that's because I I you

589
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,960
know I'm a professor of Neurology

590
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,278
oncology at a a cancer hospital and here

591
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,558
at the Institute

592
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:33,319
that I really think that if we take care

593
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,720
of people uh we should do it in a

594
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:39,119
ethical way with empathy uh I don't mind

595
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,919
if there's money at the tail end of this

596
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:45,158
for Physicians or institutes but I think

597
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,360
we can't lose the fact that patients

598
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,720
want to be taken care of uh again in

599
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:52,759
medical marijuana programs not

600
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,038
recreational so I I don't believe in

601
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,558
calling a number and getting certified

602
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:01,640
and then see you one year and I I and I

603
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,599
accept $250 from you to me that's not

604
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,200
taking care of human beings that's a

605
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,519
business yeah no and I think part of the

606
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,399
problem too is is something that you

607
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:13,639
touched on earlier is that most medical

608
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:16,759
professionals are not educated on

609
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,440
cannabis so you know a lot of these

610
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:21,079
patients who who want access to cannabis

611
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,840
can't really go to their primary care

612
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,519
doctor and have a an intelligent

613
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,319
conversation about it because you know

614
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:29,158
they're just not they're not educated

615
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,439
and you I was one of those six seven

616
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,278
years ago I I'll admit I'm the first one

617
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,440
to admit that this was a process this is

618
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:38,480
a road that I had to go down and

619
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,880
understand and go to conferences and

620
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,640
read books and uh and and it really has

621
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,840
opened up my eyes and understanding why

622
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,919
we're in the situation we are today

623
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:52,480
because then comes the politics of

624
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:55,919
cannabis the social impact on cannabis

625
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,798
and and uh you know the and and to

626
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,159
understand where why we are here today

627
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,960
you need to go back historically

628
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,240
understand the history of Catabus not

629
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,079
the one about 2,000 years ago or a

630
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:12,480
thousand years ago or oi in Kolkata

631
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:15,038
India in the 19th century I'm talking

632
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,558
about the 20th century history and how

633
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:21,798
we are here today everything from uh

634
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,639
from uh Nixon and the why we are in the

635
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:25,359
situation we are today you need to

636
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,360
understand that and then you get a B

637
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,038
comfort with cannabis yeah absolutely

638
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:32,158
all right so let's transition to some of

639
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:34,319
the research that that uh your team is

640
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,840
doing I know that um you might have some

641
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:40,038
newly published research uh into a

642
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,599
couple different conditions yes so so

643
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:44,640
there's two type of research what is the

644
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:46,480
retrospective retrospective large

645
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,559
population studies in specific

646
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,679
neurological disorders I think what we

647
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:55,200
published recently was that migraine uh

648
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,200
thisan chronic migraines and headaches

649
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,038
which is really I think very impactful

650
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,640
uh in that treatment of that population

651
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:06,480
we have done a lot of uh recent phenetic

652
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,278
studies interesting uh looking at CBD

653
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,480
products and how uh what the Pharma

654
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,880
kinetics are of different CBD products

655
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,759
uh in healthy individuals that that's

656
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,240
what I would call Pharma kinetic studies

657
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,200
um and and we've done several of those

658
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,440
recently um what has recently published

659
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,880
is two publication I think one has been

660
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,240
accepted I think the other one has just

661
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,679
been accepted one is multiple sceris

662
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,278
well without you know educating people

663
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,320
on Ms we have one of the highest MS

664
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:43,640
populations in the United States if not

665
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:45,119
the world in Western New York so Ms is

666
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,679
you know we have thousands of Ms

667
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,000
patients so we see we saw a population

668
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,519
of Ms so we did publish an article of

669
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,480
multiple sclerosis and use of cannabis

670
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:58,440
which is relatively interesting because

671
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,399
uh uh quoting from the results that

672
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,880
about 72% of patients pain was

673
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:06,639
alleviated or improved statistically

674
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,399
significantly then they have spasticity

675
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,679
that improved and the opo use was

676
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:15,119
decreased by a significant amount of

677
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,840
patients either completely or partially

678
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:21,479
but statistically different so we have

679
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:23,798
that article and I have a very strong uh

680
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:28,200
neuropharmacological division of the

681
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:32,079
dent run by excellent uh uh Farm

682
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,919
doctors such as Dr Ranka Dr aladine and

683
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,599
really uh we're very fortunate to have

684
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,200
that team work with us hand in hand the

685
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,879
other article that we recently published

686
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,080
is medical treatment of Parkinson's

687
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,360
disease which we all see Parkinson's

688
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:47,519
disease in that group 56% of patients

689
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,119
either stopped their opioids or

690
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,798
decreased it significantly in that case

691
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:55,359
we saw about 69 patients about 87% of

692
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:58,679
patients said their quality of life has

693
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,558
improved on cannabis now I can quote so

694
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,640
that that article is called medical

695
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:05,639
cannabis in the treatment of Parkinson's

696
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:10,120
disease the lead author is uh is Tracy

697
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:13,600
abdine who is our one of our farm uh

698
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:15,678
pharmaceutical doctors uh and um and

699
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,558
that's an interesting article to read so

700
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,038
here we have retrospective looking at

701
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:22,678
studies looking at quality of life side

702
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:25,640
effect profile for example in the MS

703
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:28,278
study the main side effect was fatigue

704
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,120
11% now let me tell one of the main

705
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:33,919
symptoms of MS is fatigue right so it's

706
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,398
hard to say that the 11% side effect was

707
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,080
actually from the drug or not because as

708
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:42,959
I mentioned it's a common side effect so

709
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:45,519
so these are out in the literature um we

710
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,600
have a lot of abstracts we present at

711
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,679
the American Academy of Neurology in

712
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:54,319
fact uh for the first time ever I ran a

713
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:57,200
course uh on cannabis and I'm proud to

714
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,960
say not a hundred people showed up sever

715
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,240
several hundred people showed up for the

716
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,679
Symposium at the American Academy

717
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,679
neurology which is probably one of the

718
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,080
more

719
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,600
conservative uh medical Societies in the

720
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,240
United States I always say

721
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:13,798
that in the business of cannabis you

722
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,679
don't have to win over patients you've

723
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:19,398
won them over you don't have to win over

724
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,840
most of the politicians because most of

725
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:24,239
the politicians you won them over it's

726
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,398
the medical society you have won over

727
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,599
you've won the doctors over the doctors

728
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:33,199
individually believe in it most of them

729
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,439
but the medical societies that control

730
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,840
the behavior of doctors you haven't won

731
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,399
them over have you you go to their

732
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,240
websites and they say yeah we think

733
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,599
there may be something there but we

734
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,960
don't want you to use it we should we

735
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:50,119
want more research that's what you hear

736
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,240
across the board yep so how do you win

737
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:55,359
the medical society's over well I ran a

738
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,159
symposium uh at the American Academy

739
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:00,398
neurology which is very well received I

740
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,320
often will lecture there and give U

741
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,759
abstracts uh even at the American

742
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:08,839
Headache Society or other s neurological

743
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,798
societies so uh and I go to Europe quite

744
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:13,119
often to lecture at the European

745
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,158
societies which was

746
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,839
surprisingly is probably a little bit

747
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,320
more rigid than the American Societies

748
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,759
in many ways so you ask me what ongoing

749
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:25,759
studies well we looking at ALS ALS most

750
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:28,679
people know the term lugaric disease uh

751
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,759
we're looking at retrospective study I

752
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:34,240
can tell you some preliminary findings

753
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:36,879
so far we see about 79% Improvement in

754
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,120
quality of life uh then we looked at

755
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,480
dementia which is you huge why we're an

756
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,278
aging population dementia is going to be

757
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:50,639
a major issue for us as the as our

758
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:53,000
lifespan increases as we get older uh

759
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:56,278
it's a major issue uh so we looked at

760
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,720
dementia we saw a 65% Improvement in

761
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:59,119
quality of life I'm not going to get

762
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,558
into the specifics because it hasn't

763
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,479
been published but we're very op open uh

764
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,158
optimistic about that study we have a

765
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,200
study looking epilepsy we know that a

766
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:13,519
CBD product epd Olo has been approved by

767
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:18,480
the FDA via GW Pharmaceuticals uh for

768
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:21,638
the treatment of lenx Gat and Draves and

769
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,519
even tubers so these are three rare

770
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:27,079
types of seizures and epidox has been

771
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:30,880
approved uh we looked at our population

772
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:34,119
when we added cannabis we saw a 70% 71%

773
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,639
reduction in seizure control again

774
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:39,518
retrospective not perspective not

775
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:43,918
something that would be accepted as a

776
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:46,839
FDA approved uh drug we also looked at

777
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,919
anxiety and insomnia uh we saw a 50%

778
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:53,278
reduction in insomnia and 45% reduction

779
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,159
in anxiety and we also looking at autism

780
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,720
with one of my colleagues Dr mcvg who's

781
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,200
a pediatric neur

782
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,759
neologist so we yeah we're very much

783
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,038
interested in putting the research in uh

784
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:09,320
that's what we're doing now uh and and

785
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:11,519
and and educating Physicians educating

786
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,679
the population educating the business

787
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,800
world yeah and now you and you mentioned

788
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,760
that sort of the the medical

789
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,560
associations are the the ones you need

790
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,560
to win over H how is that fight

791
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:29,599
going um it's like fighting Mike Tyson

792
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:32,358
yeah um not doing well um you know I

793
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,039
always say that if you can't change him

794
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:38,119
from the outside change him from the

795
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:40,559
inside right join them I did and I it's

796
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,480
very difficult because a they always

797
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:45,519
back off and say where is the research

798
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,079
where is the prospective randomized

799
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,918
research and we don't have it is it our

800
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,639
fault that a schedule one drug and FDA

801
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:55,719
legal no it

802
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,519
isn't so I understand academically what

803
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:00,639
they say but there's a lot of drugs we

804
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:03,320
use if you look at them these old

805
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:06,239
drugs there weren't randomized studies

806
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,280
and we still use them but understanding

807
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,358
and being respectful for they're coming

808
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,720
from yes we have to do the randomize

809
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:17,119
studies yes uh uh the Cannabis doctors

810
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:21,319
have to be legitimate they have to come

811
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,519
with uh with um some legitimacy in their

812
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,960
credentials and understand that you're

813
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,639
fting an uphill battle that you will win

814
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,599
one day

815
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:33,039
uh we you know this is going to be

816
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,240
one and maybe descheduling it to

817
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,920
schedule three is the first step to do

818
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:40,479
randomized studies then you can change

819
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,920
the perspective of the academic medical

820
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,639
Societies in this

821
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,400
country around the world not just United

822
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,358
States but United States when it takes a

823
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,079
lead on anything then most of the other

824
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:53,759
countries will step up and and and uh

825
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,680
Contin and continue what the American

826
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,599
results are so I'm hopefully getting

827
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,838
these studies done here

828
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,599
um I'm looking for sponsors which is

829
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,358
very difficult who's going to sponsor my

830
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,920
study uh cannabis business is not hot

831
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:09,639
anymore you know the the stocks are down

832
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,920
there there's a shortage of money uh and

833
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:13,519
who's going to throw millions of dollars

834
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,960
but it's not thousands millions of

835
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:21,039
dollars for a randomized study looking

836
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:23,119
at uh Placebo versus different ratios of

837
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:26,039
cannabis and migraine for example

838
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,480
beautiful study it's going to work but

839
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,358
who's going to sponsor that will the

840
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,838
government sponsor that I can't get

841
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:35,078
Federal money on a federally legally

842
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:37,519
company I can't get it from the NIH uh

843
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,760
it has to be done state within the state

844
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:42,039
and it has to be done by a company that

845
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,880
will support that uh you know in many

846
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:47,559
ways we should uh join forces everybody

847
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,720
who works with cannabis every business

848
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:55,400
puts in into a uh a bank and from that

849
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:57,719
bank have a committee looking at good

850
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,680
scientific research and then sponsoring

851
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:03,959
it from that uh uh bank and then then

852
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,919
physician groups can then publish these

853
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,639
things perspectively I think that's a

854
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,119
possibility in the future something we

855
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:11,960
can talk about at our meetings yeah I

856
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,240
know and because I was going to bring

857
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,358
that up that you know these cannabis

858
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,399
companies they're not going to fund the

859
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,598
research partially because they're not

860
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,519
going to have like a proprietary drug

861
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,599
either right I mean it's it's a natural

862
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:27,159
medicine so if you publish that research

863
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,280
then you're actually kind of emboldening

864
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,719
your competitors as well and not just

865
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,560
you that's right so you have to look at

866
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:35,598
the big picture and can't look at your

867
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:38,480
own interest which is very difficult

868
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,760
today because uh because the fact that

869
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,880
companies are not doing well and they're

870
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,079
looking at the bottom lines so to

871
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,920
support research that's going to be if

872
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,200
it's positive if it's good it's going to

873
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,440
be good for everybody so you got to look

874
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,639
at the big picture uh and hopefully one

875
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,000
day we'll see that so you mentioned

876
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,039
rescheduling and I think that's

877
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,679
something that we're all sort of

878
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,838
watching and hopeful for that there

879
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:05,118
we'll see some movement there but so say

880
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:07,639
um it does get rescheduled I think what

881
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,440
schedule three is one of is what's on

882
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:11,279
the table here how would things change

883
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,200
for you if if that were to

884
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,880
happen

885
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:19,279
well it's gonna change a lot of things

886
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,800
um so schedule three is like

887
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:26,319
cabine um and I think T Cod number three

888
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,440
is in schedule three also so first of

889
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:32,838
all still going to be federally legal

890
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:37,480
illegal but locally I could do a

891
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:39,279
prospective study looking at cannabis in

892
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,400
the treatment of I'm going to give you

893
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,599
an example I do have a protocol which I

894
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,639
wrote for this for chronic migraine

895
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,640
migraines defined by morning than 15

896
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:54,440
headaches a month uh and I can look at a

897
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:56,480
uh Placebo or a 20 to1 1:1 ratio and 5

898
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,240
10 15 20 milligrams that's a perspective

899
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,119
respective study there'll be several

900
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:03,358
arms I could do that you can ask me

901
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,720
who's going to fund that I'm going to

902
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:09,639
say right now nobody who's gonna fund it

903
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:14,519
we're gonna fund it uh I have a

904
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:17,960
benevolent um uh uh family Dent family

905
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:20,440
Dent was a uh philanthropist back in the

906
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,240
60s who by the way had Parkinson's dis

907
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,920
he started Institute in

908
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,879
1963 and and there is a family

909
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,039
non-for-profit Family Foundation that

910
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,760
supports research within the Institute

911
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,559
and they by the way for the

912
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:38,720
last six seven years have unequivocally

913
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:41,159
supported my research in cannabis and

914
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,519
that and that's and that has given me

915
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,440
the opportunity to publish to put us on

916
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,239
the map they still support but we're not

917
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,960
talk about Millions we're talk about

918
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,879
significant amount but they do support

919
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,159
us so yeah I'm going to get some seed

920
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,800
money from them to

921
00:39:54,159 --> 00:40:00,239
support a study if if I can do that if

922
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,519
it becomes a schedule three drug and

923
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,919
then I can publish that article

924
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:07,358
prospectively randomized

925
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,960
study part of the money from seed money

926
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:13,960
from the dent Family Foundation part of

927
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,679
the money through the dent cannabis

928
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,079
Clinic we you know we'll readjust money

929
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:20,519
to put it in research uh so instead of

930
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,720
putting it in our pockets we'll put it

931
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,039
in research self-funded if you want to

932
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,078
use the term and then we can publish

933
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,480
that once we publish that I could show

934
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:32,160
it to the insurance companies I can show

935
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,679
it to the medical societies and and then

936
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,679
let them critique it and you know one of

937
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:39,519
the things is one of the problems I

938
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:41,480
think you may understand is cannabis

939
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:44,159
medical marijuana or medical cannabis

940
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,039
programs are too expensive for patients

941
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,799
yeah now I did it a way about I did a

942
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,800
way you don't have to pay me cash that's

943
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,160
a positive for the patient right but

944
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,599
they have to pay in cash and some of

945
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:58,399
these patients are paying $800 a month

946
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:00,760
they can't afford it and let me be

947
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,960
honest with you in the medical marijuana

948
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:07,440
program most of the people can't afford

949
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,159
it and because they can't afford it and

950
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,519
the insurance companies throw their arms

951
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:13,559
up and say you know we're sympathetic we

952
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,480
know that if you put somebody on medical

953
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:19,358
marijuana they'll tell take less opioids

954
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,719
they'll take less Xanax they'll take

955
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:25,480
less sleeping pills they'll take less uh

956
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,879
anti-inflammatories so it's good for the

957
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,000
insurance company

958
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,800
but they fall back on the fact no

959
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,480
research yeah so if I have a prospective

960
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,680
study the first thing I'm going to do is

961
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,639
present it to every CEO of every

962
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,598
insurance companies because let's pay

963
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:43,039
for this because a I save you money I

964
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,920
keep patients out of emergency rooms

965
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:46,400
they have less testing because their

966
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,400
quality of life have improved and

967
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,559
they're L using less drug so that's the

968
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,039
first thing I'll do so that may change

969
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:55,599
something uh at that level then the

970
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:56,880
medical societies will look at it

971
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,200
critique it

972
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,079
uh it'll be published in uh in

973
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,279
peerreview journals which is very

974
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,800
important and maybe we start moving at

975
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,680
the medical society level uh so I'm

976
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,519
optimistic that for me it's going to be

977
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:12,399
fine it's going to be a step in the

978
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:15,000
right direction I'm not sure if it's

979
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,800
going to help the business of cannabis

980
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,639
because that's still federally legal

981
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,559
there's still taxation

982
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:25,318
issues um um banking issues as you all

983
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,119
know and I don't get involved in that I

984
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:30,239
just read what I read so but in my

985
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:34,318
perspective I think it's a positive

986
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:36,519
move yeah so will insurance companies

987
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,639
they will well I mean there's a lot that

988
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:40,440
goes into it but be it being a schedule

989
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:43,519
three drug would not you know preclude

990
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,519
them from from covering

991
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,319
it it could be a schedule three drug but

992
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,920
it'll but anything you use it for it's

993
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:53,599
off label because it's off label because

994
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,599
it's not not been approved in that

995
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,359
disease for example uh what disease say

996
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:03,200
migraine that's makes it easy 36 million

997
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:05,598
migr in this country 36 or 700,000

998
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,838
patients in the United States with FS

999
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,800
yeah that's a lot of

1000
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,558
patience will they approve it they won't

1001
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,318
because show me the research right right

1002
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:19,359
right how can I prove a drug off label

1003
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:21,920
that there's no science that shows it

1004
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:24,000
works then you go testimonials well I

1005
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,358
have patients who can't live without it

1006
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,159
that doesn't count it doesn't

1007
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:31,358
testimonials don't

1008
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:34,399
count randomized phase two phase three

1009
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:36,920
studies do count yeah so that's what

1010
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,358
we'll have to do and we'll do it yeah

1011
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,880
and then would it come down to that they

1012
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:42,838
would approve a

1013
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:46,119
certain uh formulation or a certain

1014
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:48,719
product or could it be as as broad as

1015
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:51,400
cannabis so so that's that's a that's

1016
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,719
another problem you yeah Ben you open up

1017
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,559
a can of worms because that's the

1018
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:59,838
criticism of a plant it's it can't can't

1019
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,720
patent it and it what that what we're

1020
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:04,199
dealing with is never sativa or Inda

1021
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:08,519
they're all hybrids right yeah and when

1022
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:10,639
you do a study how rigid and strict is

1023
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:12,599
the use of Catabus and what are you

1024
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,719
using actually well that's one of the

1025
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:17,838
advantages of New York State because our

1026
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,879
patients know exactly what's in it I

1027
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:23,799
know what's in it I know what the ratio

1028
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:27,480
is so I'm so you can't do it with

1029
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,599
recreational it has to be regulated

1030
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,519
cannabis coming from probably one

1031
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,838
facility that's tested regularly each

1032
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,039
batch and look at that it won't be easy

1033
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:41,279
it won't be

1034
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:43,480
easy but it's as but it'll be a step in

1035
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,319
the right direction absolutely

1036
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,679
absolutely yeah I think we're all we're

1037
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:50,960
all hopeful that that's um that's what's

1038
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:54,960
going to happen but um remains to be

1039
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,519
seen um and sure go ahead no I was

1040
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,559
saying one of the problem is that a lot

1041
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:03,318
of smart doctors a lot of smart

1042
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:06,400
researchers are working at the best

1043
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:10,119
places in the country academic centers

1044
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,720
that are FDA funded by research so there

1045
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:14,440
have a fear of doing cannabis research

1046
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,919
by having their other research being

1047
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,200
pulled so look there's a lot smarter

1048
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,318
people around the country at Duke and

1049
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,078
John's Hopkins at Mass General who I

1050
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:25,318
know

1051
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,760
personally uh who could do the research

1052
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:29,199
uh but

1053
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,720
one of my advantages that that Institute

1054
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:36,199
that's behind me is a private

1055
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:38,558
Institute and I don't have a CEO of a

1056
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:42,078
hospital I don't have a dean of a

1057
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:45,040
university saying yes or no if we think

1058
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,720
it could work we'll do it in in a

1059
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:53,440
legitimate process but we can do the

1060
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:54,959
research uh and but in the United States

1061
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,318
most of the high quality research is

1062
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,159
done at academic centers that

1063
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:02,800
unfortunately some times they're they're

1064
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:06,440
they're unable to do it because of uh

1065
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,200
fear and political reasons yeah yeah

1066
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,119
absolutely all right Dr Mel I definitely

1067
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,480
want to be mindful of your time um and

1068
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,599
you're you're kind enough to come on

1069
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,920
here um but before I let you go I want

1070
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,519
to give you an opportunity to share with

1071
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,119
the audience any additional resources or

1072
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,599
research I know that you you mentioned

1073
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,599
some studies some papers and I'll

1074
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,160
definitely put those links in the show

1075
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:31,400
description so people can uh read more

1076
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:33,078
and learn more so if there's other

1077
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,720
resources sort of like that that I could

1078
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:38,760
include uh please let me know and also

1079
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,838
um any other other plugs for the dent

1080
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,079
Institute and yourself um now is the

1081
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:45,039
time yeah we're very happy to see all

1082
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,440
patients for all neurological disorders

1083
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:49,358
including cannabis you have a lot of

1084
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,960
good people in this country doing

1085
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,199
excellent research uh I always quote

1086
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,079
Ethan Russo I think he has done

1087
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:59,719
extremely work I recently I had Dustin

1088
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:02,480
surle coming into my office oh great and

1089
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:04,199
he he G he was kind enough to give me

1090
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,159
his book which I've been reading which I

1091
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,279
think is excellent reading so if you

1092
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,639
like to read Dustin cac's book I think

1093
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,519
it's on cannabis it is really a

1094
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,759
phenomenal book and he's called the

1095
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:16,679
Healer and I understand why meeting him

1096
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,240
so we have a lot of good people in this

1097
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:23,039
field I think what you need to do is is

1098
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:26,598
just bring him together uh uh brainstorm

1099
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:30,318
what's our next steps at that level uh

1100
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:32,440
so so I will continue my you know uh

1101
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:34,960
large population retrospective studies I

1102
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,318
think uh I have 800 patients on cannabis

1103
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,079
who have a neuropathy and people in the

1104
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:41,838
audience many of them have neuropathies

1105
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,559
so I think that's a very interesting

1106
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,799
study I'm putting together um I like to

1107
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,599
see the results of that but my

1108
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:52,400
preliminary results are quite positive

1109
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:55,559
uh so yeah so uh there's a lot of uh you

1110
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,838
know um good books out there uh come to

1111
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,359
the these meetings I think these

1112
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:02,558
meetings are phenomenal talk to

1113
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:05,880
individuals uh I just want the business

1114
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:09,880
of cannabis to support the science of

1115
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:12,079
cannabis because if we uh have a Schism

1116
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,400
if we depart from each other then it

1117
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,960
will never be accepted in the medical

1118
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,000
community and that's what we have to do

1119
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,559
we have to accept it at medical schools

1120
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,079
where they teach it to the medical

1121
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,720
students we have to look at residency

1122
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:26,800
programs where patients are able to

1123
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:29,199
bring their cannabis to the hospital and

1124
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,480
not told you can't bring it in we have

1125
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:34,519
to look at it at the attending level and

1126
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,440
at the University levels also so we have

1127
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:38,719
to win them over but it's it'll take

1128
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,240
time but it's gonna happen right it's

1129
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,000
gonna happen because once you're in the

1130
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:47,239
Cannabis you realize the

1131
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,760
results uh and and it's not a Panacea

1132
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:52,039
meaning it's not doesn't cure everything

1133
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,400
and we have to watch out because as soon

1134
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:57,000
as you tell a doctor that I'm gonna

1135
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,318
treat your cancer with only medical

1136
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,318
marijuana their eyes will roll and they

1137
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:03,679
think you're a nutcase that's what we

1138
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:06,880
have to watch out for you can say that

1139
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:11,078
there's scientific proof that in in

1140
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,720
tissue uh examples that in animal models

1141
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:15,960
that Canabis has decreased the size of

1142
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:17,719
tumors but you can't take it to the next

1143
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,880
level where that's the treatment because

1144
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:21,838
I see patients coming to my office who

1145
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,240
have breast cancer which is a treatable

1146
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,318
disease of today who said no I don't

1147
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,439
want radiation I don't want chemo I just

1148
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,960
just give me cannabis I won't treat

1149
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,240
those patients I'll give them cannabis

1150
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,679
because it improves their quality of

1151
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,719
life but they have to go through

1152
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,558
mainstream treatment so we have to be

1153
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:40,919
very cautious and we have to emphasize

1154
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,880
to our colleagues that too yeah

1155
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,079
