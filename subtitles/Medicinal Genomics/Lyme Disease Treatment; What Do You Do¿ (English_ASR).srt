2
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,519
great I think we we touched on how

3
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,759
people acquire it what the difference

4
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:20,480
stages are we briefly touched about

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,080
different treatments now is that a

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,800
rabbit hole that we can go down it's a

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,559
bit of a rabbit hole what what I would

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,599
suggest when people get if people get

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,559
Lyme disease and the initial treatment

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,000
isn't

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:37,439
enough then a great thing to do is um

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,558
there's a few resources one is to look

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,280
up um your local Li many especially if

14
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:44,718
you're in a major urban area or in a

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,079
largely populated state there's going to

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,679
be Lyme disease support groups he

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,280
contact them he say I'm really sick my

18
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,600
initial treatment is not working I'm

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,640
looking for names of doctors who

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,840
specialize in treating L because it

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,600
really is a specialty it's called Lim

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,559
literate um is a is a term to use I'm

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,120
looking for a lime literate physician

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,518
there's another organization called

25
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,719
ilads it's called International lme and

26
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,400
Associated disease Society they they

27
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,280
really have established a protocol for

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,880
this and that's where uh your lime

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,159
literate Physicians get their training

30
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:18,359
from you can go to their website and do

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,400
a search for doctors trained in your

32
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,118
area um and find somebody to talk to

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,320
most of the time these people will not

34
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,159
be accepting insurance and

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,959
so uh good rule of thumb is to get a get

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,478
a good quality rule out if you're sick

37
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,000
sick and and you want to know if you

38
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:34,359
truly have Lyme disease or not you

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,159
probably expect to spend somewhere

40
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:40,319
around $1,000 oh wow yeah just to find

41
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,118
out if you have really yeah what if

42
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,398
you're talking about spending a doctor

43
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,959
$200 an hour for their time and then the

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,640
testing is generally out of

45
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,639
pocket and the testing would be from

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,040
those lime literate Physicians and not

47
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,200
um well they would they would draw the

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,159
last but there's there's a few Labs that

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,039
really because I told you the testing so

50
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,520
bad the standardized test there's yeah

51
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,960
Labs that are fully credited in good

52
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,319
Labs but they they they're not uh

53
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,239
insurance coverage uh generally because

54
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,359
they do their own assays um and so

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,719
they're that's uh but they do a good job

56
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,160
and that's usually where these um

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,840
doctors will send the

58
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,039
tests okay yeah and I have to imagine

59
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,039
too I mean at least from my own

60
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,039
experience with with finding the deer

61
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,598
tick it's tiny I mean I think they

62
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:26,719
describe it's like the size of a sesame

63
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:30,000
seed yeah the nips can be that small yep

64
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,560
so I imagine that you know like perhaps

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,639
in your case too where you have some of

66
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,360
that that summer flu or something or

67
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,518
that you know that sickness that you

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,640
just can't kick and you know attributed

69
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,120
to oh it's a virus or something but it

70
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,039
really could have been yeah my you

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,959
sometimes people don't know they're a

72
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,000
bit my dad almost died last year uh he

73
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,640
was in the emergency room in and out for

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,840
for three days they didn't know what was

75
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,439
wrong with him and he kept getting

76
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,039
fevers and and his organs were

77
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,120
failing and I showed up and I said have

78
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:02,759
you tested for ticks and they went what

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,560
do you do for living never you mind and

80
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,280
I was right and then they gave him my ab

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,759
biotics and he bounced right back wow

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,799
yeah yeah and so that didn't develop

83
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,079
into some sort of persistent condition

84
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,319
no because it was it was a it was that

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,640
was a that was a rare kind of case where

86
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,719
it hit him hard and fast and it was

87
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,719
anaplasmosis that was really um tanking

88
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,359
him um and that and that happens

89
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:30,080
sometimes I me he's old say 80 and and

90
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,080
yeah sometimes that happens

91
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:44,598
