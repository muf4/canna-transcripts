1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,079
so we're going to talk about botanical

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,278
medicine we're going to take a step back

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,509
we've been talking about a plant where

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,919
we haven't talked about botanical

5
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,620
medicine so let's take that step back

6
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:16,190
and actually talk about botanical

7
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:20,698
medicine as a field as a offering to

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,500
pharmacological activity this comes from

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,960
a lot of years of me thinking this

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,268
through and so I haven't had to cut this

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,980
I had some real world application in

12
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:30,149
here but I thought it was probably more

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,560
important that you've got some of the

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,299
foundation before he went into real

15
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,339
world this used to be an hour and

16
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,828
15-minute lecture it is now 45 minutes

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,500
so I'm gonna be moving fast so let's

18
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,378
talk about very abbreviated history of

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,238
botanical medicine and of course we go

20
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:50,308
back at least 5,000 years to the written

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:52,919
word and Chinese ru Vedic in those two

22
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:54,089
systems argue over who was first it

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,649
looks like if you look at the history

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,719
books that are Iveta Commodus n' was a

25
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,058
little bit ahead of chinese medicine but

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,390
that comes from an Arabic perspective on

27
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,069
my end but they had all kinds of

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,510
compounds and it turns out if you look

29
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,188
at our Vedic medicine and Chinese

30
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,650
medicine both they're still using

31
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:14,459
compounds that have now been turned into

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,790
drugs in their pharmacies and their

33
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,618
physicians are writing drugs from so

34
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,420
recert being printed for instance is

35
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:24,150
something that you may or may not use

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,210
anymore but there's a lot of drugs out

37
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,420
there that are really useful and some of

38
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,250
them turned into tools and labs as well

39
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,099
now here's where it gets interesting if

40
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,430
we really stop and think about the

41
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:42,509
number of plants in the world that have

42
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:45,630
been used as as metric as drugs it turns

43
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,049
out that about 80% of them matched the

44
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:50,459
ethno pharmacological or ethno botanical

45
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:52,530
uses now if you stop and think about

46
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:56,158
that we tend to have this idea of

47
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,989
barefoot traditional people as being

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,350
ignorant but I want to reframe that

49
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:04,048
because if 80 percent of 122 plants that

50
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,478
were using as drugs right now somebody

51
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,500
beat us to it that didn't understand

52
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,389
pharmacology and chemistry in isolation

53
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,349
it says a lot about what we have to

54
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:18,779
learn from method

55
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:22,049
botany moreover if you really look at

56
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,840
the developing world it turns out that

57
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,740
about 80% of the developing world uses

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,520
botanical medicines for primary care and

59
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,469
so I would say that in the US were

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,170
developmentally delayed in the sense of

61
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:41,759
being aware of other options besides Big

62
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:43,979
Pharma now if you also look at the the

63
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,109
drugs had been approved over the last 50

64
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,619
years excuse me 30 years about 50

65
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,540
percent of those are basically based off

66
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,819
natural products either directly where

67
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,919
they've isolated it from a plant or

68
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,530
indirectly where they has been able to

69
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,599
synthesize the exact same molecule or a

70
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,379
very close derivative of that molecule

71
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,719
because it was cheaper to do so in

72
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,840
oncology from about the 1940s to the

73
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,340
current date about 175 small molecules

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,280
have been improved and about half of

75
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,740
those are actually natural products so

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,969
for cancer as well so this this keeps

77
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,320
cannabis out of the picture we're not

78
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,789
talking about cannabis here at all we're

79
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,709
talking about other botanical medicines

80
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:24,719
but here's the thing that really alarms

81
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,980
me is there's an estimate that there's

82
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,659
somewhere between a quarter of a million

83
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,500
to half a million plants on the planet

84
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:34,319
and only about 6% of those have been

85
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,360
screened for biological activity now

86
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,859
that's all well and good but what's not

87
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,190
willing goes that we lose a plant

88
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,600
species a day and especially what's

89
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:45,389
going what's going on in Brazil right

90
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,019
now where for some reason they've taken

91
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,509
the control off burning that we're

92
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,980
losing species it's probably more than a

93
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:58,739
day one a day at this point anybody

94
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,539
recognize that turmeric that's right

95
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,930
looks a little bit like Ginger st.

96
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:06,109
family's and your Barry AC no I want you

97
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,939
to take us take a second here I feel so

98
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:11,010
tied to this I tend to move when I

99
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,569
lecture um once you take a second here

100
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:16,349
let your eyes adjust to this what you're

101
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:19,019
looking at is chemical space okay and

102
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,479
each of those graphs natural products

103
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,949
that are drugs natural products that are

104
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,349
derived drugs okay so they've been

105
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,180
changed slightly and natural product

106
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,550
inspires synthetic drugs and

107
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,699
completely synthetic drugs what I want

108
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,680
you to notice just in an overview is

109
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,889
look at the grouping between the first

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,430
graph and the last graph so what you see

111
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,680
is that we have when we're synthetically

112
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:48,740
making drugs we have a pretty narrow

113
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,329
range when nature is biosynthesized

114
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,228
compounds phytochemicals they're all

115
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:54,000
over the map

116
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:55,560
and I want you to think about that from

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,538
a couple of different angles I want you

118
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,569
to think about that number one from drug

119
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:03,569
targets because if you look at those

120
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:05,099
synthetic drugs about 35 to 50 percent

121
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:09,029
of those targets for those drugs that

122
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:13,050
are in the synthetics are all targeting

123
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:15,779
GPCRs so in other words what I'm telling

124
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,470
you is that we have narrowed our drug

125
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:21,359
therapies to what we know and there's

126
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,520
all this stuff that we don't know yet

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,160
that these natural products that are

128
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,149
scattered all over the chemical space

129
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,520
different characteristic different

130
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:31,109
properties have the potential to hit and

131
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,478
that and I would like to say there's

132
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,120
dark pharmacology going on with

133
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,069
medicinal plants not not dark as in

134
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,228
Darth Vader but dark in the sense that

135
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,069
the drunk is looking for his keys under

136
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:43,199
the light post

137
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:45,598
but there's everything else where the

138
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,370
keys probably are and we're stuck and

139
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:48,870
still stuck and looking under the light

140
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,418
post because we're just focusing on a

141
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,098
couple different types of targets so

142
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:55,918
this should really get us thinking too

143
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:57,750
about evolution evolutionarily if you

144
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,418
stop and think it through what we've

145
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,750
really been able to do is what plants

146
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:07,439
have really been able to do is derive a

147
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,139
broad-spectrum protective effect and so

148
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,639
that gets interesting now real-world

149
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,069
application here these are what you're

150
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,090
looking at is cannabinoids and this is

151
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:20,158
cannabinoids based on activity or and

152
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:22,978
what you're seeing there is that

153
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:25,889
cannabinoids have their unique space

154
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:28,199
whereas most of the other drugs again

155
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,300
they start to cluster and they cluster

156
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,389
away from cannabinoids so we really are

157
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,028
looking at unique pharmacology here with

158
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,278
cannabinoids the same same photo here in

159
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:40,500
terms of actual actions activities here

160
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:42,000
cannabinoids tend to be different

161
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,860
than the rest of the rest of the drugs

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,040
so it gets it gets very interesting very

163
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,470
quickly and I can do that for almost any

164
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,090
other plant as well by the way so let's

165
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,250
look at that evolutionary perspective so

166
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,959
while humans were still learning to walk

167
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,509
plants had figured it out

168
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,819
plants couldn't pick up their roots and

169
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,949
run away so they had to figure out a way

170
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:05,790
to adapt they had to figure out a way to

171
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:09,329
survive that harsh conditions of

172
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,670
evolution at times and if we look at

173
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,800
humans role in this so now we're we've

174
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,280
gone from 300 million years ago to you

175
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,020
know 10 million 5 million years ago

176
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:21,809
particle phytochemical intake for

177
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,979
Paleolithic humans was about 8 times and

178
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,230
I think this is a very conservative

179
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,970
estimate about 8 times greater than

180
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,919
modern humans now if we're talking about

181
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,130
a moderate modern human this eating the

182
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:35,819
standard American diet I'd say it might

183
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:38,069
be close to a hundred times right I had

184
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:41,459
the opportunity when I was I was working

185
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:42,959
as a professor and what I did you know

186
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,519
how freshmen will do almost anything for

187
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,620
you but by the time their juniors had

188
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:50,219
burnout well so I had all the freshmen

189
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,840
do food logs and I looked at what we did

190
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,760
is we broke it down to the number of

191
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:58,799
plants that they had in their diet and

192
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,839
it was about 10 4 for the best sometimes

193
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,509
I got up to 12 but about 10 plants now

194
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:06,449
your ancestors in the Paleolithic Age

195
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:10,110
it's somewhere between 80 to 220 plants

196
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:12,839
a year depending on what what continent

197
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,400
where they were but think about that

198
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:18,659
difference in terms of Plateau chemical

199
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,399
intake now speaking of that so what's

200
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,750
happened in terms of chronic disease and

201
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,879
this is really where I think it makes

202
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,339
starts to make sense because I would

203
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,990
postulate that phytochemical deficiency

204
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:32,189
is a root cause of chronic disease

205
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,049
remember all that dark pharmacology we

206
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,940
were just discussing it's absent in

207
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:39,889
people that just eat white bread and

208
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:43,010
fast food and so we have very different

209
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:46,470
conditions pharmacal physiological

210
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:50,850
context today in terms of what we're

211
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,830
putting in now consider that the African

212
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,330
hunter-gatherers body mass index is

213
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,000
about 19

214
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,250
and their serum cholesterol every

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,528
American's body mass index actually and

216
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,570
that's gone up since this is about 26

217
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:07,139
and and the Sam cholesterol is around

218
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,269
294 so again that physiological context

219
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:13,259
has changed dramatically and part of

220
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:14,399
that push towards that body mass index

221
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,708
and serum cholesterol is almost

222
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,750
certainly not just that we're eating

223
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:21,259
more fat and more cholesterol but that

224
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,360
we have absent from us phytochemicals

225
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:25,919
now think about adaptation because

226
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,950
really that's what evolution is right

227
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,199
we're adapting to conditions and so if

228
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:35,490
we think about that what it didn't know

229
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,920
it's almost necessarily what will in

230
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,579
fact necessarily is that structures

231
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:44,189
change now

232
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:45,899
dr. silic mentioned structure and

233
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,940
function right it's not just about

234
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,870
chemistry well our structure starts to

235
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,200
change based on what we're exposed to

236
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:57,600
and so this becomes very key and so

237
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,459
genes are modified can be modified by

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,700
what we're eating that's how part of our

239
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:04,769
structure changes so your ancestors what

240
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,839
they were eating is what you're carrying

241
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09,750
now in terms of the structural changes

242
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:15,660
that came through and so if we think

243
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:17,490
about receptors that are responsive to

244
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:19,379
natural products think about opioid

245
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,940
receptors think about vanillite

246
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:22,679
receptors and those plants for each one

247
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,010
of you think about nicotinic receptors

248
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:28,828
think about dopamine receptors think

249
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:31,169
about cannabinoid receptors think about

250
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:33,449
type 2 cannabinoid receptors think about

251
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:35,909
esters and receptors think about

252
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,890
adenosine receptors think about gaba

253
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:39,809
receptors and think about P bar

254
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:41,669
receptors and in fact P bar is a

255
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:43,349
particular interest to me I spent a

256
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:45,360
number of years with my head inside the

257
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,480
nucleus almost figuratively

258
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,000
that's a funny image but people are is

259
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,550
particularly promiscuous you can

260
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,600
actually bind to ligands at one time in

261
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:59,698
a P bar binding pocket so people are

262
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,500
really is almost a phytochemical sensor

263
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:04,109
and if you recall people are gamma is an

264
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,970
important site for and by the way is

265
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,860
part into a cannabinoid system now is an

266
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,259
important site for not just diabetes

267
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,039
but also for inflammatory processes and

268
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:18,179
autoimmunity so we really do have the

269
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:21,439
series of adaptations due to what we

270
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:25,469
were eating and what we were exposed to

271
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,750
and today even at this point we can

272
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,910
still point to a lot of different

273
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,208
phytochemicals that we eat regularly

274
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:34,620
like for example quercetin quercetin by

275
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,809
the way I use for my allergies that

276
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,810
stabilizes mast cell membranes but it

277
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:45,359
also has an effect on gene expression so

278
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:48,509
daily we're exposed to our dietary broth

279
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,000
and that turns on and turns off genes

280
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:53,490
and the genes you're turning off and

281
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,480
turning on are different than the guy

282
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,799
who is eating at McDonald's right and so

283
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,360
that becomes a very interesting idea

284
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:08,669
right is that our dietary broth

285
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:10,669
basically is steeped every day are into

286
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:16,349
our genes are steeped every day by our

287
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:18,240
dietary broth now plants shape humans

288
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,899
and one of the really super obvious ways

289
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,629
that's low hanging fruit is the

290
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:27,778
cytochrome p450 system right we're

291
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:30,419
looking at at least 75 different genes

292
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:32,519
here for cytochrome p450 and cytochrome

293
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:35,669
p450 you may think of it as something

294
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,220
that's exogenously affected but remember

295
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:41,969
cytochrome p450 is huge in things like

296
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,860
breast cancers c 1 p 1 a 1 versus 1 B 1

297
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,870
is going to make make a D difference

298
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,970
between those fiery 16 hydroxyl

299
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:51,320
estrogens and those 2 and 4 hydroxyl

300
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:54,860
estrogens so it makes a huge difference

301
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:58,740
what we need to do is keep in mind that

302
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:01,259
these the the the inter-individual

303
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,440
variability in a cytochrome p450 system

304
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:07,049
is huge is very vast and it's very vast

305
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,329
because our ancestors developed eating

306
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:13,198
different plants depending on what

307
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:15,389
region they were in and so that really

308
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:18,659
points at for example caffeine

309
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:21,600
metabolism tends to vary about 60 fold

310
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:23,278
between an individual's

311
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,829
so you know people that can drink a cup

312
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,299
of coffee right before bed and have a

313
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:29,189
great night's sleep and you know people

314
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,750
they have one cup and actually you

315
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,920
probably don't know you probably don't

316
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,198
know that this is the issue but they're

317
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,939
gonna have one cup and and have a hard

318
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:37,409
time sleeping that night I think there's

319
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,819
a lot that goes on and now with

320
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:41,610
Starbucks you know and young people are

321
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:45,419
going well I need a triple shot in my

322
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,600
coffee of espresso right we're getting

323
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:52,948
up to 250 up to almost 300 milligrams of

324
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,278
coffee or caffeine per dose so huge

325
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:59,338
inter individual variation and we also

326
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,019
can alter metabolism as well as change

327
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,350
our biological fitness not just of

328
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,539
ourselves but also as dr. sumac just

329
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,980
pointed at the cannabinoid receptors

330
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:12,778
have a role in turning on turning off

331
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,879
potentially our microbiome in different

332
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:16,980
ways and so in the same sort of way all

333
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:21,088
these organisms that we carry really

334
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:23,100
respond to our phytochemistry now this

335
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:24,810
idea this phytochemical index was put

336
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,889
out by a guy named Mark McCarty and

337
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:30,838
McCarty dropped out of medical school

338
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:32,938
and made a good career for himself as a

339
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,050
research scientist and he dropped out of

340
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,879
medical school because they didn't think

341
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:38,758
what we he was doing was making sense to

342
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:41,159
him and the reason he said is we're

343
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,379
ignoring the idea of planets we're

344
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:44,969
ignoring the idea of of the

345
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:47,009
phytochemistry that were exposed to so

346
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,769
we came up with this idea of the P I the

347
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:52,800
phytochemical index and what he said was

348
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:56,188
well let's figure out how this alters

349
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:59,609
human fitness and so his idea basically

350
00:14:56,188 --> 00:15:01,919
is we could use this epidemiologically

351
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,769
to understand disease processes even

352
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,860
more so and so he did that

353
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:10,259
here's his original paper but he moved

354
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,300
on to actually some proof of principle

355
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:15,028
and by the way he points out very cute

356
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:17,068
very Keeley is that non-nutritive

357
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:19,110
phytochemicals appear to be key

358
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:20,729
non-nutritive so there's there's a

359
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,139
nutrients there's the the vitamins and

360
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,550
minerals that we get but those

361
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,970
non-nutritive phytochemicals are

362
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:29,309
particularly of interest in that of

363
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,819
course is going to have a huge effect on

364
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:34,259
health now proof of principle so a

365
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:35,389
number of years later and it took a

366
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,879
while but

367
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:39,019
here you have something showing

368
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,298
inflammation and overweight young adults

369
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:43,220
and the phytochemical index is inversely

370
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:46,458
related to adiposity and oxidative

371
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:49,009
stress so the higher the P I the lower

372
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:51,558
the oxidative stress and the

373
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,249
inflammatory process here's another one

374
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:56,360
on breast cancer and again what you see

375
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:58,759
though is in the fourth quartile of

376
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,829
dietary phytochemical index in other

377
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:08,959
words the most phytochemical index had a

378
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:11,438
decreased risk of breast cancer and then

379
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,969
here's another one on hypertension

380
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:15,828
Dietary P I was inversely associate with

381
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,809
a hypertension center occurrence and

382
00:16:15,828 --> 00:16:19,638
they again they point out synergistic

383
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:20,868
effects and we'll talk about that in a

384
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,459
couple of lectures here on

385
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,809
phytochemicals from different foods a

386
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:26,178
responsible for the inverse association

387
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:28,548
between high dietary P I and the risk of

388
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:31,220
hypertension and then we get to this

389
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:33,919
idea of insulin resistance and again we

390
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,569
see a very significant effect and this

391
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,938
shouldn't surprise you because what we

392
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:38,628
just talked about with people are gamma

393
00:16:36,938 --> 00:16:40,879
again part of the endocannabinoids

394
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:42,918
system now but people are gamma being

395
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,928
almost a phytochemical sensor in the

396
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:47,838
body it's so promiscuous that it binds

397
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:51,769
so many different compounds and so what

398
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,559
we what would we see after and here's

399
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:55,818
the here's here's the shot here that

400
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:58,188
really makes a difference

401
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:59,868
hi purlins anemia in the first quartile

402
00:16:58,188 --> 00:17:02,328
versus the fourth quartile insulin

403
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:04,038
sensitivity insulin resistance they all

404
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:07,898
show beta cell dysfunction they also

405
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:11,328
very significant decreases beneficial

406
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:16,578
decreases in activity based on

407
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:18,349
phytochemical index so this is where it

408
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:19,849
starts to get interesting is it just one

409
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,288
chemical and this is the way that we've

410
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,028
approached pharmacology is we've

411
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:25,548
approached it by saying well let's find

412
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:29,028
that the gem in the jungle of compounds

413
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:30,798
but that might be the wrong approach and

414
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:32,808
it might be the wrong approach and a lot

415
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,879
of people agree with that they say well

416
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:36,710
it might actually be an additive or

417
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,110
synergic effect that actually is having

418
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,519
me the activity so I just want to show

419
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:42,949
you all these compounds that are coming

420
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,990
up now they're all anti-cancer but

421
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,149
they're not just anti-cancer in one

422
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,589
mechanism they hit more than one pathway

423
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:50,778
every one of these compound

424
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:52,759
it's at least two different pathways at

425
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,960
least two different pathways so we're

426
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:56,778
talking about garlic here we're talking

427
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,308
about legumes in general people think

428
00:17:56,778 --> 00:18:00,500
genestein is just soy but it's not we're

429
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:02,058
talking about wines right we're talking

430
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,880
about tomatoes

431
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:06,649
we're talking about peppers so all kinds

432
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,900
of compounds up here really have a

433
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:12,080
significant role and we're going to see

434
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,419
this with cannabinoids as well and early

435
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,428
exposure to phytochemistry so what

436
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:18,860
happens when we are exposed early on in

437
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:22,278
life versus not exposed to early on and

438
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:24,048
I love this and this is Waterland by the

439
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:26,000
way in Journal and they did they did a

440
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:27,740
great series of studies they showed

441
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,079
human empathy epidemiological data

442
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,210
indicates the susceptibility to Adeline

443
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,788
so a chronic disease is influenced by

444
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:38,149
persistent adaptations to prenatal and

445
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:39,589
early postnatal nutrition and then this

446
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:41,359
study came out and I'd like to see more

447
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:44,028
studies like this this was a 60-year

448
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,319
study by the way so you can imagine for

449
00:18:44,028 --> 00:18:47,058
those of you who are researchers you can

450
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,220
imagine the funding issues around that

451
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:50,869
right higher childhood consumption of

452
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,058
fruit was associate with the reduced

453
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:55,219
risk of adult cancer in a study of

454
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:58,720
almost 4,000 adults and I wonder how

455
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,740
many they lost in that 60 years right

456
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,929
but these are the kinds of studies that

457
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,950
we actually need this is epidemiological

458
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:09,559
evidence at its best ten years

459
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:13,610
interesting 60 years that really gives

460
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:15,829
us some information so how do we fight

461
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:19,129
cancer speaking of cancer prevention

462
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:21,648
right and yet I don't see a lot of

463
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:26,090
activity in that direction honestly by

464
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:28,849
by our pharmaceutical companies and that

465
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:31,189
seems almost criminal to me knowing what

466
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:34,788
I know about the phytochemicals that are

467
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,259
very preventative it seems we really

468
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:38,569
need to be thinking more about

469
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,970
preventing breast cancer and other

470
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:42,528
cancers than treating it now treating it

471
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,819
is important but what if we could

472
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:44,329
prevent it and how much money could be

473
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:46,548
saved

474
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:48,980
well then somebody wouldn't be making a

475
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:51,200
lot of money sorry I guess I'm a little

476
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,819
twisted this today yeah the genetic

477
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,440
component of all complex traits just as

478
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:57,048
hypertension arthritis and cognitive

479
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,390
function is influenced by a broad range

480
00:19:57,048 --> 00:20:01,398
of effects spread across many snips and

481
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,660
many genes now this is an important

482
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:03,819
point

483
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,310
to remember it's one more treating

484
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:08,789
chronic disease we're not going after

485
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:13,029
one target but this is what we do

486
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:16,119
currently in pharmacological approaches

487
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:19,059
we go after one target and it may be

488
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:21,359
exactly the wrong idea and that may be

489
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:24,339
why if you look at if you look at the

490
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,199
rates of chronic disease that's which by

491
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:29,109
the way are going up but you look at the

492
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,880
rates of visits to physicians 75 percent

493
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:32,939
of those visits are for chronic diseases

494
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,310
which means that they keep going back

495
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,470
because it's not working right and so we

496
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:40,599
really need to rethink this what if

497
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,569
every position had a nutritionist in

498
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:45,929
their office what if every nutrition

499
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:48,700
looked at the phytochemical index if

500
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,960
nothing else and said to their patient

501
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,160
you know you really need to eat more

502
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,500
fruits and vegetables and what if we had

503
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,930
to walk people and we would need to do

504
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,799
this I know for most people we'd have to

505
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:05,019
walk them by the hand to show them how

506
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,730
to do that most people don't even there

507
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:08,289
was a program that I was involved in in

508
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,410
Baltimore inner-city Baltimore for

509
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:12,759
addicts and they once they made it to a

510
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,380
certain point that got into a halfway

511
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:16,720
house and then people started donating

512
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,790
fruits and vegetables they threw out

513
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,000
almost all the vegetables because they

514
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:25,649
didn't know what to do with them

515
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,579
and I don't think this is unusual so

516
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:32,200
what's the evidence so number one herbal

517
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:33,939
medicine for caught the systemic review

518
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,670
and I'm going to I'm going to cruise

519
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,509
through these but basically there is

520
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:42,670
evidence or oral herbal herbal therapies

521
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:47,379
for treating osteoarthritis again there

522
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:49,330
is evidence herbal medicine for low back

523
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,000
pain even I was surprised by this one

524
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:57,059
but and this is not cannabis but there

525
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,140
is evidence a Cochrane review on

526
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:03,849
[Music]

527
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:05,140
congestive heart failure so what is it

528
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:08,369
about herbal medicine so that's actually

529
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,410
different than pharmaceuticals well

530
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:14,259
here's my main take we're treating

531
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,370
networks with herbal medicines we're not

532
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:19,059
treating one

533
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:20,889
it's target so and let's talk about

534
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:22,599
networks for a second if systems biology

535
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,250
has been a huge breakthrough especially

536
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,230
in ecology but it's starting to affect

537
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,000
other fields now and some of those other

538
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,400
fields that are affecting include

539
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,990
pharmacology we'll talk about that in a

540
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,300
second here but network biology

541
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:38,710
basically suggests that what you want to

542
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:41,230
do is massage alter modulate whatever

543
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:47,319
term you want to use multiple nodes in a

544
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:50,319
network at once and when you do that you

545
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:55,029
can start to look at aggregate behavior

546
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:57,129
now aggregate behavior is a another way

547
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:59,980
of thinking about emergent behavior

548
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:03,100
right what is emergence emergence is

549
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,160
when one plus one here's a here's a

550
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:08,349
simplified example that's that's got

551
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,840
some colloquial truth to it you put one

552
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:12,549
neuron or two neurons in a dish and it's

553
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:15,459
interesting you put three neurons in a

554
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:17,710
dish in a system is created and you see

555
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,319
behavior that you won't see with one or

556
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,299
two neurons alone and so that's what's

557
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,089
happening is we're creating

558
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,589
characteristics that we can't

559
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:30,039
acknowledge when we're just studying the

560
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:31,899
properties of one compound or one cell

561
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:34,990
or one receptor we're starting to see

562
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:38,220
networking activity that goes well

563
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,220
beyond what we might expect

564
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,680
and unfortunately the usual mathematical

565
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:46,929
techniques that we would use to do this

566
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,250
drawing a straight line on a graph which

567
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,090
unfortunately I've done a lot of in my

568
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,369
life

569
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:53,289
can't really explain this behavior and

570
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:55,479
so it tends to get ignored and tends to

571
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:57,700
get missed you know you know that one

572
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,099
that outlier on the graph that's what I

573
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,420
want to go after right what happened

574
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:06,730
there but we tend to throw it out now

575
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:11,740
here's a real living cellular network

576
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:16,420
this this is put out by a company that

577
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:19,420
does network analysis and it's stunning

578
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:21,880
it's beautiful isn't it that's what's

579
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,500
happening inside a cell so really what

580
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,000
starts what starts to happen and this is

581
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,680
molecular biology this is the field

582
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,369
right is what you're looking at is

583
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,250
signaling you're looking at cross

584
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:33,949
you're looking at relationships much as

585
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:37,308
physics shifted from the particle back

586
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:39,470
in the 60s and 70s to the relationship

587
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:40,819
between the particles that's what needs

588
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,890
to be happening in medicine at this

589
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:45,439
point is we need to be looking at the

590
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,630
relationships so we cut out the heart we

591
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,130
put it in a box and we study it we cut

592
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,080
out the kidneys we put it in a box and

593
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,770
we study it we study its weight its

594
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:56,480
property is its volume its but how are

595
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:59,089
we understanding the signaling is going

596
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,380
on and that's a huge piece we spend some

597
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:04,308
time there but we don't spend enough

598
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:09,290
time there here's a very simplified

599
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:11,569
model of immune network that certainly

600
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:13,569
would be affected by many different

601
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:17,869
compounds whether pharmacologically

602
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:19,220
synthetic or bio synthetic but what we

603
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:20,928
really need to start doing is thinking

604
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,920
in systems and not just thinking about

605
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:26,809
one target thinking broadly and so if

606
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,279
you really look at how we've managed

607
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:30,470
unresponsive patients and our clinical

608
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:32,389
practices a lot of times what we've done

609
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,589
is combinations of drugs because we're

610
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,740
thinking we start to think more in

611
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:37,928
systems right if we're my opinion if

612
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:43,370
we're thinking in the right direction

613
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:45,500
and I like to sing somebody once said

614
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:48,469
that a dirty drug is a drug that works

615
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,109
now what is meant by a dirty drug in

616
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,970
pharma a dirty drug is a target that

617
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:56,000
hits more than one at a drug that hits

618
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,100
more than one target and so think about

619
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,529
that for a second just think about the

620
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:02,899
name and we've given it that's not

621
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:05,450
something we want right but in fact if

622
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,980
we go back to evolution and the way that

623
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,080
we were eating and the phytochemicals

624
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,700
that we were exposed to that's exactly

625
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:14,149
what they were doing they were hitting

626
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:16,429
more than one target and think about it

627
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,190
from the plants perspective we'll do a

628
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:21,140
pollen esque a Michael Pollan desk model

629
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,940
of this why would the plants say to

630
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,740
itself well if I'm going to produce I'm

631
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,080
gonna spend all that ATP making a

632
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,620
compound it better be useful in more

633
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:33,259
than one place right it makes sense this

634
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:34,779
is how plants evolved to survive 300

635
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,670
million years

636
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:40,279
and by the way Gleevec is a great

637
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,340
example of a blockbuster blockbuster

638
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:44,430
drug the

639
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:46,109
only hit was designed to only hit one

640
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,789
target and when they started looking at

641
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:48,929
why it was so efficacious they

642
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:50,750
discovered that it was actually hitting

643
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,310
multiple targets

644
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,130
so thinking and system really means that

645
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:59,069
we needs to rethink how we go about this

646
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,170
rethink how we evaluate and how we think

647
00:26:59,069 --> 00:27:04,379
one disease one drug is the model and

648
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:08,610
that really came from pest or in Ehrlich

649
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,930
but we need to move past that so let's

650
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:11,490
talk specifically about network

651
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:15,779
pharmacology now this field is probably

652
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:17,309
about 10 to 15 years old now and Dustin

653
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,569
and I are the only ones that I know at

654
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:20,970
this point talking about Network

655
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:22,829
pharmacology with cannabinoids but it

656
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,990
actually makes sense and I just have a

657
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:26,460
comment here Occam's razor was theology

658
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,890
you know what the idea of Occam's razor

659
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,930
is it's a simplified explanation right

660
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,520
the simplest explanation is what it is

661
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,170
and that's used in labs all over the

662
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,200
world and it's actually using clinics

663
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,690
all over the world as well but guess

664
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,390
what akhom the the man akhom he was a

665
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,980
theologian so are we really are we

666
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,160
taking scientific advice from a

667
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,950
theologian and I'll let you decide if

668
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,750
that's a good or bad thing so what is

669
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,210
network pharmacology the recognition

670
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,680
informed by systems biology that drugs

671
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,210
from many disease states may require

672
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,610
multiple activities to be efficacious

673
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:04,259
acting on the network of tissues cells

674
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:06,809
receptors enzymes and the genome and so

675
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:08,369
let's take an example here and let's

676
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:10,139
look at asthma targets so these are all

677
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:13,250
the targets that are known so this is

678
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:17,150
under the under the light post right

679
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:20,039
that we know of for asthma and then

680
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:22,550
here's all the drugs that we know of

681
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:25,500
that can actually treat these conditions

682
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:28,829
and so there's a number of drugs we can

683
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,019
we can use but what I'd like to do is

684
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:36,029
turn this on its head let's take the

685
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:38,369
common food grape and Vitus and let's

686
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:41,069
look at all the compounds that are anti

687
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:45,599
allergic anti osmotic asthmatic excuse

688
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:48,889
me that are anti Brahm Kotik they're

689
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:54,669
anti leukotriene and anti frenetic and

690
00:28:48,890 --> 00:29:02,100
then antioxidants and more antioxidants

691
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:06,539
and to prostaglandins anti-spasmodics so

692
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:10,059
what do you think your plants make sense

693
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,349
and so could could and by the way I

694
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:13,419
don't think if I was going to treat

695
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,019
asthma as a clinician with herbal

696
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,210
medicines

697
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:19,299
I wouldn't use grapes I picked a really

698
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,660
simple food to you highlight this

699
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:25,240
example so this is this is a minimum of

700
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:30,750
what activity you might have versus an

701
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,750
herb that we see used to treat asthma so

702
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:39,190
does the patient that comes in with

703
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:40,779
asthma who's eating fast food respond

704
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:44,529
differently than the patient that's come

705
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:46,210
in it's eating a diet high in fruits and

706
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:48,279
vegetables has a high phytochemical

707
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,660
index I'd like to suggest to you that

708
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,940
they're going to respond very

709
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,210
differently to your your approach your

710
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,309
pharmacological approach based on what

711
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,769
they're eating you're either going to be

712
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,899
enhancing that effect or just really

713
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:04,180
trying to push hard to get an effect

714
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,650
when there's not much other activity

715
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,990
supporting that there's not a found

716
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:13,830
phytochemical foundation just support

717
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:16,329
the pharmacology that you might use so

718
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:19,389
Network pharmacology basically we're

719
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:22,529
looking at multiple targets versus

720
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:25,060
single targets and compared to that

721
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,950
Marshall multiple but partial

722
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:30,579
perturbations and I like this term

723
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,650
multiple but partial perturbations of

724
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,960
selected genes and network are almost

725
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,640
always more efficient than the knockout

726
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,240
of a single well selected target and

727
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:44,290
think that through basically what you've

728
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,839
got here is a nudge versus a

729
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:49,240
sledgehammer right when we go in with

730
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,250
one with one drug for one target we're

731
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,769
hitting it with a sledgehammer when we

732
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,690
go in with a bunch of broad-spectrum

733
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:58,420
phytochemicals we're massaging the

734
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,880
system we're nudging this system so that

735
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,610
it's not a hundred percent it's not even

736
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,680
80 percent inhibition for an enzyme for

737
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:07,329
example it might be more like twenty but

738
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,900
if we hit a bunch of enzymes in that

739
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:10,899
system

740
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:15,180
at 20% inhibition we actually have an

741
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,180
effect that turns out to be safer

742
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,808
so it's robust right and this is the

743
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:26,019
this is the issue here is redundant

744
00:31:22,808 --> 00:31:28,960
pathways robust living molecular

745
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:31,210
networks have redundant pathways and so

746
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,539
when we try to knock out one pathway

747
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:37,750
with a single target drug we're almost

748
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:42,129
always going to lose efficacy efficacy

749
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:43,690
over time and if we look at this it

750
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,550
really does look like what we have been

751
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:49,630
doing with food plans forever in terms

752
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:51,279
of our in terms of our diet so I think

753
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,309
of it as ensembl properties I think of

754
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,500
it like music so when we put one

755
00:31:54,308 --> 00:31:59,440
compound in what does that sound like

756
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:02,529
and then when we put multiple compounds

757
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,370
in that have grown together in a plant

758
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:11,410
is there some sort of chemical harmony

759
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:13,299
there now

760
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,390
this study came out and it made a lot of

761
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:19,690
noise and it came out and I think it was

762
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,450
2003 a strategy to reduce cardiovascular

763
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:25,289
disease by more than 80 percent

764
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:29,110
published in British Medical Journal and

765
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:31,869
basically what they suggested was that a

766
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:34,269
multi-component remedy a poly pill they

767
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:35,678
called it based on a single daily pill

768
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,869
containing six components those

769
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,929
components were statin three blood

770
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:44,558
pressures lowering drugs at half the

771
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:48,160
dose again partial nudges partial

772
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,808
inhibition folic acid in aspirin and

773
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,670
what was their conclusion now this was

774
00:32:49,808 --> 00:32:53,769
all theoretical but their conclusion was

775
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,710
it would prevent 88% of heart attacks

776
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:58,720
and 80% of strokes okay that got

777
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,069
everybody's attention in fact there are

778
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,808
a couple of papers that came out after

779
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:03,549
this that made fun of this

780
00:33:01,808 --> 00:33:07,779
multi-component remedy because it got

781
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:10,058
everybody's attention well how would it

782
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:11,799
really affect our epidemiology about 1

783
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:14,289
in 3 people would directly benefit each

784
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,720
on average gaining 11 to 12 years of

785
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:20,529
life without a heart attack or stroke

786
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:25,450
that's pretty darn profound and then

787
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:27,129
what would what would happen in terms of

788
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,930
the United States alone half of our

789
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,660
cardiovascular disease deaths in the

790
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:34,450
United States would be prevented pretty

791
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,440
profound and they say hey eating more

792
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,319
fruits and vegetables and whole grains

793
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,779
actually might make real sense and and

794
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,720
by the way getting salt and trans fats

795
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:46,899
and then here's the proof of principle

796
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,779
so somebody just did this study where

797
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,759
they find those on the poly pill had 1/3

798
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:53,259
fewer cardiac events or 5 years in the

799
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,879
control group and the poly pill group

800
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:56,650
with high adherence greater than 70

801
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,200
percent of adherence the reduction in

802
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:01,540
the risk of major cardiovascular events

803
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,460
was 57 percent fewer cardiac events than

804
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:06,779
control so they didn't we didn't get the

805
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:12,369
promised 80% but we got almost 60% and

806
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:13,898
that's really notable now let's take the

807
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:15,940
poly pill from a plant

808
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:17,230
here's garlic there's our your

809
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,369
cholesterol-lowering agents

810
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,460
there's your blood pressure lowering

811
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:23,138
agents there's your anti-inflammatory

812
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,519
agents in which by the way of course

813
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,329
would be a good idea with cardiovascular

814
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:28,269
disease

815
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:34,918
there's your anti-ag regrets there's

816
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:34,918
your antioxidants does it make sense

817
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,029
over 40% of drug targets and map with

818
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,769
disease genes mapped to more than one

819
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,120
disease so really when it comes down to

820
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:45,280
it and again I look at it from the

821
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,259
molecular biology there's a common theme

822
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,669
going on the molecular biology but yet

823
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,919
we name them differently and we treat

824
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:52,898
them differently right if we start

825
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:55,239
thinking on molecular biology level we

826
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:57,309
really start getting that gosh a lot of

827
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:59,709
these diseases have a common thread and

828
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:01,269
we can treat that common thread it might

829
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,470
depend on the weak link it might depend

830
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:05,469
on the snips that you've got it might

831
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:06,789
depend on the family inheritance that

832
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:09,159
you've got it might depend on the diet

833
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:11,800
that you've got physiological context is

834
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,809
all so a drug discovery approach that

835
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,789
MACT matches with a systems biology

836
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:17,980
approach is really going to give us

837
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:19,389
combinations of small molecules and you

838
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,860
start yours we're starting to see that

839
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:22,900
right we're seeing ACE inhibitors with

840
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,470
statins now we're seeing that look at

841
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,389
the drug cocktails for tuberculosis

842
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:31,230
resistant tuberculosis or cancers we're

843
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:31,230
starting to see this

844
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,940
okay so intervening in a network

845
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,549
pharmacological strategies with multiple

846
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,050
targets might have a better chance of

847
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:45,349
affecting a complex weeka Librium a

848
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:49,960
whole cellular networks and drugs and an

849
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:53,470
enhanced safety profile okay so let's

850
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:57,369
this looks like it I may have the old I

851
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:59,568
don't think this is the abbreviated

852
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:01,358
okay so differences is compared to

853
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:05,269
pharmaceuticals what's the differences

854
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,949
and I pull the case studies here I

855
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:08,420
apologize that slide is slightly in

856
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:10,608
error so here's what I want to leave you

857
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,088
off with here if there's differences and

858
00:36:10,608 --> 00:36:15,588
some of those differences I put it

859
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:17,779
categorized into two broad categories

860
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:19,759
there's pharmacodynamic differences and

861
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,559
there's pharmacokinetic differences the

862
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,839
pharmacodynamic differences there's

863
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:25,760
multiple modes of activity in other

864
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:28,250
words biochemical convergence on a

865
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,530
single outcome okay but there's also

866
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:34,989
multiple constituents that can work on

867
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:39,579
one target so you can end up with

868
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:44,169
molecular multitasking on one hand and

869
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:46,940
target hitting getting hit by multiple

870
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,318
molecules then pharmacal kinetically we

871
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,690
affect things like absorption

872
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:52,849
distribution metabolism excretion and

873
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,318
toxicology a lot of what you're going to

874
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:57,829
see and if you think about this again

875
00:36:54,318 --> 00:37:02,449
evolutionarily is that plants really

876
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:04,400
have this role in affecting the

877
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:06,048
accessory compounds in plants that not

878
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,200
the actors really have a role in

879
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:12,829
affecting pharmacokinetics so we may

880
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:15,259
improve bioavailability we may we may

881
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:17,480
delay metabolism of the count of the

882
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,910
actives so this is really super common

883
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,559
now keep in mind that 50% of all drugs

884
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:23,719
on the way to far on the way to the

885
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:26,720
market fail because of poor

886
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,289
pharmacokinetics so this is something we

887
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:33,649
should consider

888
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:34,969
I'm going to stop there I'm good why

889
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:39,338
don't we why don't we just because we're

890
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:41,629
a little behind schedule anyway are we

891
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:44,269
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna call it quits

892
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:46,460
and we'll I think we have a break now

893
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:47,820
right yeah break time

894
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,559
like yeah

895
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,559
[Applause]
