1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,359
um thank you very much and I'd also like

2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:10,519
to thank the McCrone is for asking me to

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:13,338
participate in this and also for being

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,900
very wonderful colleagues and as Brian

5
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:16,339
said I'm gonna be talking about the role

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,830
of cannabidiol and the treatment of

7
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:20,719
refractory pediatric epilepsy and this

8
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:22,848
has been a huge focus of our work over

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,500
the past three years so it's really an

10
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:26,649
honor to be able to come and talk with

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,849
you about what we've been doing

12
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:30,799
importantly I have been very involved

13
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:32,988
with GW Pharma in these clinical trials

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,239
in the expanded access program so those

15
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:36,619
are my disclosures and then I thought

16
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:38,179
it'd be good to start since this is a

17
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,728
mixed audience first kind of really

18
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:42,378
describing what epilepsy is first of all

19
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:44,079
a seizure is a disturbance in the

20
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:46,698
electrical activity of the brain and

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,920
epilepsy is simply defined as two or

22
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:52,039
more unprovoked seizures occurring

23
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,629
greater than 24 hours apart and epilepsy

24
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,429
is actually a spectrum of disorders

25
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:57,649
there's many many different types of

26
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:00,170
seizures there is many many causes of

27
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,390
seizures both in children and adult with

28
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,849
some overlap but some quite distinct and

29
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,030
there's also many epilepsy syndromes as

30
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,129
well as types of epilepsy medically

31
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,509
refractory or intractable seizures are

32
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:13,938
defined as seizures that are not

33
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:16,728
controlled by anticonvulsant medications

34
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:18,468
or are controlled only by medications

35
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:20,539
that have significant side effects and

36
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:23,089
it's estimated that one-third of

37
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,978
individuals children and adults who

38
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,240
develop epilepsy will go on to have

39
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:31,158
intractable or refractory epilepsy

40
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,868
looking down at how what an unmet need

41
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,728
for treatments are in this country the

42
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:38,030
incidence of epilepsy in United States

43
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:40,340
per year is estimated 150,000 new cases

44
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,560
and the prevalence of epilepsy in the

45
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,689
United States is about 2.2 million

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,359
people the prevalence of epilepsy

47
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:49,818
worldwide is greater than 65 million

48
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:52,158
people and the estimate of prevalence of

49
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,420
refractory epilepsy in the United States

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,170
is about seven hundred and thirty

51
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,060
thousand people worldwide it's 20 1.7

52
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,019
million people I'm so quite a

53
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,840
significant healthcare issue currently

54
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:07,548
in 2017 we do have options for children

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,129
and adults when they develop refractory

56
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:12,560
epilepsy in fact medications we've had

57
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:14,719
17 new medications become available over

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,520
the past 20 years there's also an

59
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,960
important rule for dietary therapy which

60
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,880
can be very effective in

61
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,349
epilepsy as well as our nerve

62
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,729
stimulators both the vagus nerve

63
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,919
stimulator and the responsive

64
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:27,319
neurostimulator and there's also a role

65
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,569
for epilepsy surgery I've been in spite

66
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,879
of these treatments particularly the 17

67
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,769
new medications the incidence of

68
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:36,109
refractory epilepsy has really not

69
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,700
changed over time which demonstrates

70
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,220
that there continues to be really a

71
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:43,280
significant unmet need for effective

72
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:45,099
safe and tolerated therapies so then

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,629
kind of making a case for cannabidiol

74
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,699
first of all I say most of this audience

75
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:52,310
knows but the medical community is kind

76
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:54,379
of naive and ignorant of as this is not

77
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,759
really a new idea and so we've had some

78
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:58,280
discussion today I'm also going to just

79
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,359
briefly review through history some of

80
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,550
the references to the treatment of

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,800
epilepsy I then we'll look briefly at

82
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,810
the mechanisms of action today make

83
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,390
sense as a possible treatment for

84
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,039
epilepsy look at the preclinical studies

85
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,289
that have been done in the animal models

86
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,659
of epilepsy and then turn to what is the

87
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:17,810
clinical data and then what do we still

88
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:19,340
need to know so as this audience knows

89
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,229
cannabis has actually been used as a

90
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,240
medical treatment for thousands of years

91
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:26,419
the first reference in the use of

92
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,030
epilepsy was in Texan 2200 BCE from

93
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:31,280
Sumeria and then from the Middle East a

94
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,219
kind of also descriptions in the 1100

95
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,930
and 1400 seee about using cannabis

96
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:39,560
specifically in the treatment of

97
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,599
seizures more recent history in 1842

98
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,240
O'Shaughnessy reported that cannabis

99
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,039
reduced infantile convulsions then

100
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,719
suggesting also that could be effective

101
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,090
treatment in infants with seizures as

102
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:53,270
well as others as well as hydrophobia

103
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,219
lockjaw and rheumatism and in 1856

104
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,530
McQueen's reported the successful use of

105
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,810
a tincture of cannabis indica in for

106
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:04,069
children with epilepsy including a

107
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:06,500
seven-week female in 1881 William

108
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,629
gaolers who is a very very famous child

109
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,150
neurologist and every neurologist knows

110
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:13,129
his name reported that cannabis had been

111
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,310
recommended for epilepsy by Russell

112
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:19,189
Reynolds in 1861 as sometimes though not

113
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,170
very frequently useful small value is an

114
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:23,810
adjunct to the bromide but is sometimes

115
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,000
of considerable service given separately

116
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,759
and Gower's actually administered

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,060
cannabis in many cases with the effect

118
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,250
of delaying the Paris's

119
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,889
and mitigating the severity in some

120
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,050
individuals and actually in the 1800s

121
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,899
and early 1900s I think that cannabis

122
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,370
was used very frequently and widely in

123
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,679
the United States and elsewhere in the

124
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,649
treatment of epilepsy and then as we all

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,290
know in 1851 actually the u.s.

126
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:51,810
dispensary can assist convent cannabis

127
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,360
compounds were suggested for neuralgia

128
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,089
depression hemorrhage pain relief muscle

129
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,420
spasms convulsive disorders and other

130
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:02,909
ailments and then 1860 the Ohio Medical

131
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,160
Society Committee on cannabis indica

132
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,920
said that efficacy was claimed for

133
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,050
infantile convulsions epilepsy and many

134
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,990
other disorders so again a mounting

135
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,579
evidence over time including 1800s that

136
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,590
this could be a very effective treatment

137
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,990
for epilepsy very important then because

138
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:20,789
at that time there were only really only

139
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,280
one medication available in the

140
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,140
treatment of epilepsy and then as we all

141
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,339
know and I was actually sad to learn

142
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,219
that it was my blue state of

143
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,989
Massachusetts in 1911 that became the

144
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,700
first state to outlaw cannabis and thus

145
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,069
ending the prohibition of alcohol and

146
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,259
the other states quickly followed with

147
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,389
the marijuana prohibition laws and then

148
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,370
as we all know in 1970 the u.s.

149
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,189
Controlled Substances Act pact a pest

150
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,860
Act passed classifying marijuana as a

151
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:49,050
drug with no accepted medical use and I

152
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,180
think as we've discussed today as all of

153
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,949
us are aware then not only not put kind

154
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,620
of incredible limitations on this

155
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:58,110
clinical use but also of research into

156
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,709
the possible benefits of the compounds

157
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,330
in the cannabis plant in 1996 California

158
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:06,989
became the first state to legalize

159
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:09,120
medical marijuana and by 2015 medical

160
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,310
marijuana was legalized in 23 states

161
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,220
again regulated at the state level by

162
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,100
the DEA and CBD specifically was made

163
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,870
legal and in additional 16 states and I

164
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,550
think that this has been a fabulous and

165
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,410
incredible movement to watch because I

166
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,930
think a lot of this was really driven by

167
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,090
the patient community that really wanted

168
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,560
access to this treatment not only for

169
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,599
their children with epilepsy but for

170
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,189
other disorders and I think as we're all

171
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,990
aware over the past several years

172
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:35,759
there's been increasing anecdotal

173
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,910
reports about the efficacy of medical

174
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,339
marijuana especially the CBD enriched

175
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,590
formations in the treatment of pediatric

176
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,329
epilepsy and this has been

177
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,429
I think every child neurologist and most

178
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:49,439
neurologists in this country have not

179
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,600
seen a patient with epilepsy in the past

180
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,819
three or four years without the patient

181
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,260
or their parents asking for access to

182
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,219
this as a treatment for their seizure

183
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:01,829
disorder so Catherine Jacobs and Brenda

184
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,500
Porter I kind of did a Facebook survey

185
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:07,319
and solicited data I'm on Facebook serve

186
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,050
150 families whose children had been

187
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,420
using chemical Abaddonn rich cannabis to

188
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,550
treat their drug resistant seizures they

189
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,490
had a low response rate of only 12 point

190
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,370
7 and the patients or the kids included

191
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,829
Dravet Syndrome kids do syndrome which

192
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,019
is a myoclonic a static epilepsy another

193
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:27,149
very highly refractory epilepsy one with

194
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,039
Lennox Gaston which we'll be hearing

195
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:31,919
about later by dr. divinsky one with

196
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,780
idiopathic epilepsy and this population

197
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,000
that responded the survey had been on an

198
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:40,939
average of 12 prior anticonvulsant

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,370
medications overall 84% noted a seizure

200
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:45,719
decreased frequency and the CBD

201
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,000
including two that had experienced a

202
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,770
complete remission so that's a low

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,110
number but remember these children had

204
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,120
been on a prior above no mean of 12

205
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,240
medications so really highly medically

206
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,250
refractory and then cannabidiol was

207
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,129
associated with adverse events and

208
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,620
drowsiness was fairly common as was

209
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:07,079
fatigue and also was noticed some

210
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,610
positive benefits better mood increased

211
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:13,769
alertness and improved sleep a similar

212
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,420
study was done by the folks at UCLA and

213
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:17,129
they also did an online survey of

214
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,680
parents of children with epilepsy who

215
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:22,980
had also use CBD products they received

216
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,230
117 responses the mean latency from the

217
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,980
onset of epilepsy to the use of CBD was

218
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,840
5 years and I'm kind of these kids also

219
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,820
were refractory having been on a mean of

220
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,549
eight prior medications and their

221
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,290
population included 53 kids with

222
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,329
infantile spasms which is also

223
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,000
considered a catastrophic or malignant

224
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,910
form of epilepsy or Lennox Gaston

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,250
syndrome and similar to the other survey

226
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:49,740
85 reported reduction is seizure

227
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,320
frequency including 14 who became

228
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:56,519
seizure free and again many reported

229
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,980
improved sleep alertness and mood both

230
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,139
of these studies did remark that there

231
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,000
were limitations they were subject to

232
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,580
participation bias the people who

233
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,830
responded to the survey it's unknown

234
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,870
formulations of cannabidiol products

235
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,180
these kids were receiving and there was

236
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,659
also no control group I mean at that

237
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,089
time

238
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:16,769
there was a lot of pressure and I you

239
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,690
know this is really a concern to us as

240
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,819
John said earlier as being child

241
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,200
neurologist of wanting to do right by

242
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,080
our patients and making sure what

243
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:30,480
they're taking is safe well tolerated as

244
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:32,910
well as efficacious and kind of as okay

245
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,139
and then kind of looking then it doesn't

246
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,759
work via the end the cannabinoid

247
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,689
receptors as we've talked about you all

248
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,970
know better than I do

249
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,460
cannabis is the only plant species that

250
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,870
contains cannabinoids and we've already

251
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,360
discussed the cannabinoid receptor

252
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,799
family but this has had me interested

253
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,139
for many years and could this be a

254
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,000
potential treatment for epilepsy since

255
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,889
these plants contain chemicals as we've

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,649
discussed that our brains have receptors

257
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:57,899
for and we've already discussed the end

258
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,990
of cannabinoids but kind of could they

259
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,340
be playing a role somehow in epilepsy

260
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,799
and there is some evidence

261
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,259
lower levels of Anantha might have been

262
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,809
found in the CSF of patients with newly

263
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,939
diagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy in

264
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:14,459
tissue resected during epilepsy surgery

265
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,670
was found to have lower levels of the

266
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,980
cb1 receptor mrna and also reduced

267
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:22,919
expression of the amazon responsible for

268
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,990
the synthesis of 2ag but as we've

269
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,120
discussed cannabidiol does not appear to

270
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,610
exert its main neuronal effects through

271
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,500
the activation of cb1 receptors and in

272
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,440
fact it may function as indirect

273
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,179
antagonists at high levels so of course

274
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,010
there is a lot of interest and I know

275
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,389
many people in the room work on this but

276
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:41,970
what could be the possible mechanisms

277
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:44,069
then of cannabidiol in the treatment of

278
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,379
seizures and it has been shown that it

279
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,180
decreases presynaptic release of

280
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,610
glutamate glutamate being the main

281
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,919
excitatory amino acid in the brain and

282
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,169
it's been shown to do this by binding to

283
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,629
the members of the trip family of cat

284
00:10:55,169 --> 00:11:00,569
ion channels it's also been shown to

285
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:02,820
activate serotonin receptors inhibit

286
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,680
adenosine reuptake both of which we

287
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,540
think are somehow involved in epilepsy

288
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,399
it's also thought that it could have

289
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,709
anti-inflammatory properties

290
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,360
antioxidant properties and there's some

291
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,240
interests that it could modulate the

292
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,879
mTOR pathway which we know as a pathway

293
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,490
involved in a disorder called tuberous

294
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,139
sclerosis complex where 85% of those

295
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,659
individuals have epilepsy often

296
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:28,559
refractory and it may also be involved

297
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:31,169
in other forms of epilepsy so what of

298
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,849
the animal models shown us CBD has

299
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:35,729
actually been shown to be effective in

300
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,790
several acute seizure models any drug

301
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,470
undergoing development for seizures I'm

302
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:42,449
is used in several different animal

303
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,540
models of induce seizures including the

304
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,280
PTZ model mes pilocarpine induced

305
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,009
temporal lobe seizures as well as

306
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,629
penicillin induced partial seizures so

307
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,299
it was effective in all of those models

308
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:56,460
there's less convincing data in chronic

309
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,919
seizure models but that is very similar

310
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,230
to Leavitt racetam or keppra which over

311
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,839
the past 15 years has become one of our

312
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,639
most widely used and effective

313
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,250
anticonvulsant medications it's also

314
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,259
been shown that CBD increases the after

315
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,600
discharge threshold and reduces the

316
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,819
after discharge amplitude duration and

317
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,340
propagation in electrically kindled

318
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,990
limbic seizures and rats I'm so pretty

319
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,430
good preclinical evidence through the

320
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:24,029
animal models that this could be

321
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:26,219
effective for epilepsy so several years

322
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:29,490
ago now we became involved with GW

323
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,620
Pharmaceuticals they were - they have a

324
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,940
product licensed in over 30 countries in

325
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,580
developed in the United States called

326
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,180
sativex which is 50 percent THC 50

327
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,310
percent CBD I'm used for ms best hissing

328
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:42,899
also pain and they were doing

329
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:45,359
preclinical studies looking at Kevin

330
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,209
cannabidiol and would be it would it be

331
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,639
effective in the treatment of epilepsy

332
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:54,210
their product up at dialects is a 99%

333
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,819
pure oil based cannabidiol extract of

334
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:59,129
constant composition and it's in a

335
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,720
hundred milligram per mil sesame oil

336
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:05,519
based solution so with with GW Pharma

337
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,700
initial activities was the expanded

338
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,980
access program and about almost four

339
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,190
years ago now five academic centers got

340
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,659
together with GW to discuss could we try

341
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,670
and see if this would be safe and

342
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,399
effective as well as tolerated on a

343
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:20,818
patient population we all approached the

344
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,668
D

345
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:25,918
FDA and the DEA and each site was given

346
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:31,288
permission to put 25 children on a

347
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:33,808
podiatrist reitman t' and we actually

348
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:36,208
had to send biographies of each child to

349
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:38,068
the FDA describing the child their

350
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,508
epilepsy what it was due to how many

351
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,828
medications has been on how many

352
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,139
medications they were on how many

353
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:45,028
seizures they had a day many of these

354
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,769
kids had had epilepsy surgery many of

355
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:49,409
these kids were on dietary therapy many

356
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:51,538
of these kids had devices but all of

357
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:54,988
these children continued to have pretty

358
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:56,729
significant frequent seizure activity so

359
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:59,100
there are five initial sites and several

360
00:13:56,729 --> 00:14:01,679
were added afterwards the MGH ended up

361
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,168
enrolling 57 i'm total patients in the

362
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:06,899
expanded access program the initial 25

363
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:08,668
started the medication in April of 2014

364
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,048
so we have many children who have now

365
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:13,139
been on this as a treatment for their

366
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:14,970
epilepsy for three years then as dr.

367
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,609
divinsky will talk about in the next

368
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,678
talk GW then went on to sponsor trials

369
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:21,209
in Dravet Syndrome and the results from

370
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,948
the first RCT has been have been

371
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:25,258
released and dr. divinsky will review

372
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:27,238
those two trials and Lennox guess

373
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:30,629
Syndrome both of which had been complete

374
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:32,939
and the data has been released and then

375
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:34,259
also they are now enrolling in a trial

376
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:37,108
in the treatment of refractory epilepsy

377
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:40,829
and tuber sclerosis complex others also

378
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:42,418
planned trials and infantile spasms so

379
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:44,008
I'm gonna do the rest that time is just

380
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:45,720
discuss what we've seen from the

381
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:49,139
expanded access program and this is the

382
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,788
first data cut right now in 2017 there

383
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,350
are over a thousand children on up a

384
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,850
dialects through the expanded access

385
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,339
program and also some of the state

386
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,548
programs that GW has been working with

387
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:02,489
when we looked at this data there were

388
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:04,668
214 kids ages 1 to 30 years who had been

389
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:08,668
on greater than 12 weeks of CBD

390
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:11,188
between January of 2014 and 2015 the

391
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:14,188
purpose of this again it was an open and

392
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:16,318
open label expanded access compassionate

393
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:18,328
use program but we really wanted to

394
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:20,938
determine the safety tolerability as

395
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:24,478
well as the efficacy of CBD in treating

396
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:26,578
our patients we ran it like a trial even

397
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:29,309
though it was not so 12 weeks safety

398
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:30,909
tolerability data was available on 162

399
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:34,659
kids at this data

400
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:36,610
and efficacy data on 137 and this data

401
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:37,990
was collected from the eleven eleven of

402
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,149
the sites involved in the expanded

403
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,009
access program again it was

404
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,259
compassionate use open label this was

405
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:46,000
not a controlled trial all of these

406
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:48,789
patients had significantly medically

407
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,860
refractory epilepsy and we did kind of

408
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:52,779
come up with the shared trial design so

409
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,669
we'd be able to pool the data to look at

410
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,199
the experience and the bigger population

411
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:58,990
rather than each of our individual

412
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,629
twenty-five so the kids were started on

413
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,909
2.5 to five milligrams per kilogram per

414
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:06,429
day of the CBD increasing weekly

415
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:08,649
initially to a goal dose of 25

416
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:10,870
milligrams per kilogram per day if

417
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,789
children were tolerating that and

418
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,399
continued to have a seizures the FDA and

419
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:17,289
the DEA then gave us permission at some

420
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,259
sites to further titrate up to 50

421
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:21,879
milligrams per kilogram per day similar

422
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,500
to a clinical trial we did do a

423
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,029
four-week baseline to kind of get a

424
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,190
sense of the seizure frequency at

425
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:28,720
baseline before starting this and the

426
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,180
kids had to have a minimum of four

427
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,460
seizures during that time and then

428
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:36,339
during that during the trial period all

429
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,139
medications diet and vns were stable for

430
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,600
them at the prior to enrollment and were

431
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,939
continued kind of at stable doses

432
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,129
throughout the 12 weeks and parents

433
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,540
maintained daily detailed seizure

434
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,580
diaries who would be able to really

435
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:51,189
follow the data

436
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:54,730
the age range the mean was 10.5 years

437
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:57,520
with a range of 0.9 to 26.2 years the

438
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,519
sex was about equal between boys and

439
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,710
girls the background Aedes was an

440
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,259
average of three with a range of a 0 to

441
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,970
7 and the seizure frequency monthly

442
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:09,609
these kids were having a lot of seizures

443
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,360
the median was sixty point five seizures

444
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:13,169
per month

445
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:16,869
with a range of nineteen point six to

446
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:18,730
151 what we looked at safety and

447
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,500
tolerability was there at were adverse

448
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,049
events in about seventy eight percent of

449
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,849
the patients somnolence and about 25

450
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,619
percent which we now appreciate is

451
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,839
largely do a drug drug interaction with

452
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,909
those children on Club ISM there is a

453
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,889
decreased appetite and some diarrhea

454
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,509
which actually many of these parents

455
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,130
thought was a positive side effects

456
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:37,779
because a lot of these kids with highly

457
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,330
refractory epilepsy and significant

458
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:42,160
neurologic issues often have very

459
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:44,309
chronic constipation so they viewed this

460
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,019
as a positive in many cases

461
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,819
fatigue and then convulsions and again

462
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,740
convulsions this was a population of

463
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:52,289
kids with highly refractory active

464
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,269
seizure so it's just probably typically

465
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:56,700
their normal fluctuation of seizure

466
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:59,160
activity serious adverse events includes

467
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,259
status is the most common again

468
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,060
reflecting the epilepsy condition of

469
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:05,819
this population diary and weight loss

470
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,769
however only five withdrew from

471
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,049
treatment due to an adverse event and

472
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:13,379
what we saw for efficacy we were very

473
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:15,269
encouraged by 36.5 median reduction of

474
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,310
motor seizures over the 12-week period

475
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:20,250
somewhat higher and those children had

476
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:22,409
dravet syndrome and five patients became

477
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,509
seizure free of all motor seizures and

478
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,860
again that's five but these are some of

479
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:27,720
my most highly refractory epilepsy

480
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,490
patients so the fact that any of them

481
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,750
became seizure free I really thought was

482
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:36,150
fairly miraculous 54 or 39 percent had a

483
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,970
greater than 50% or were considered

484
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,070
responders greater than 50% reduction in

485
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,890
motor seizures again some children doing

486
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:45,539
extremely well and 32 of the patients

487
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,040
had atonic seizures and that's when the

488
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,440
children fall very suddenly to the

489
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,269
ground so those seizures carry with them

490
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,039
the risk of significant injury and those

491
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,670
are the kids usually see wearing the

492
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,700
helmets

493
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,320
I mean impressively 56 percent of those

494
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,580
with atonic seizures had a greater than

495
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:05,609
50% reduction and 16% became seizure

496
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:07,470
free and this is a graph from the paper

497
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:09,779
and what you see here the x-axis is

498
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,579
actually looking at each individual

499
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:13,319
patient and as you can see down here

500
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:16,259
there were some children who did not

501
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,000
seem to benefit from the CBD treatment

502
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,160
in fact some had an increased seizure

503
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,779
frequency but as you can see here many

504
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,420
of the children had a significant

505
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:26,730
increase with a decrease of up to 100%

506
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,950
this is in the last four weeks in the

507
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,779
study treatment and then these five

508
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,289
children were seizure free throughout

509
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:36,000
the entire time so again we were very

510
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:38,220
enthusiastic about this this was

511
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,500
criticized since this was open label no

512
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,600
placebo there was a great concern that

513
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,609
due to the excitement and hype about the

514
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,659
possible role of CBD in treating

515
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:48,240
epilepsy that there would be a

516
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,950
significant placebo response but as

517
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,690
you'll see when dr. divinsky presents

518
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,210
the data from the randomized controlled

519
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,880
trials it was very similar actually with

520
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,130
the efficacy so kind of what do we need

521
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,020
to know all efficacy

522
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,790
until recently has been anecdotal or

523
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:03,109
open labels so there clearly has been a

524
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:05,389
need for these randomized controlled

525
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:06,859
trials then also it's important for us

526
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,410
to educate our families and our medical

527
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:12,229
colleagues that CBD is not medical

528
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,730
marijuana it is purified CBD that we've

529
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,200
been using so I think we have a lot to

530
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,240
learn about the various medical

531
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,009
marijuana preparations both worth regard

532
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,309
to efficacy safety and tolerability in

533
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,990
the treatment of epilepsy and then kind

534
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,389
of what we have learned a CBD may be

535
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:29,329
effective and well-tolerated epilepsy

536
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,190
treatment some or many and GW

537
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:34,159
Pharmaceuticals as we've discussed has

538
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,440
the CBD purified from cannabis and has

539
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,480
these ongoing trials and then there's a

540
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,940
company called as an herb afar Masuda

541
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,620
coals that has a transdermal CBD that

542
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,980
they're planning to trial in refractory

543
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:48,019
epilepsy fragile X and osteoarthritis

544
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,549
and then I think the remain big question

545
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:52,009
is what about other forms of medical

546
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,389
marijuana kind of I'd really like to

547
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:54,950
thank this has been a huge amount of

548
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,800
effort for us over the past three years

549
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,509
we have about eighty kids either in the

550
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,279
expanded access program in these trials

551
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:03,440
and so I'd really like to thank what I

552
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,389
used to call our CBD team now I think of

553
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,490
as more of a village and several oh

554
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,259
these people are here and then just in

555
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,049
an extra twenty seconds I will tell my

556
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:13,970
anecdotal story one of the kids who

557
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,159
entered our first 25 was a little girl

558
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,289
with myoclonic a static epilepsy she had

559
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,870
daily seizures ever since developing up

560
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:22,399
lefse she'd be on every medication we

561
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:24,739
had that could treat her seizures shed

562
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,900
the vagus nerve stimulator she was on

563
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,500
dietary therapy when she started CBD

564
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,970
she'd just gotten a $14,000 seizure dog

565
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,339
and the parents tracked her progress in

566
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,620
the trial by pictures of the dog my

567
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:39,259
favorite if I go dog laying on his back

568
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:43,969
asleep with a sign behind it 256 days

569
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:45,950
unemployed this this is when the dolor

570
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,370
girl was seizure free for one year the

571
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,690
dog is now retired on the beach and this

572
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:52,789
little girl has now been seizure free

573
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,529
since starting CBD she's been able to

574
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:56,299
taper off most of her medications she

575
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:58,849
said such dramatic improvements not only

576
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:01,159
a seizure control but her overall being

577
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:03,079
that we're talking about college for her

578
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,750
and three years ago that would not have

579
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:07,099
been a conversation we could have had so

580
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,190
thank you very much

581
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:09,189
you

582
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,159
you
