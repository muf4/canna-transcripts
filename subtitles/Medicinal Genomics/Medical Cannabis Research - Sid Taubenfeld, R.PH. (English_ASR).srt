1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,769
hello thanks for being here I'm from

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,480
teakettle own farm and

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,509
and I'd like to go through a couple of

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,730
things about tikkun olam first how I got

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,009
involved in tikkun olam and secondly

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,390
what tikkun olam is up to now one of our

7
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,250
studies which I think will have

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,560
important implications for the cannabis

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,278
community and basically what other

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:35,878
research were doing I was working as a

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,710
hedge fund analyst portfolio manager and

12
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:39,750
someone called me up and said you know

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,219
what you interested in in doing a

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,710
cannabis company and running a kind of

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,869
his company and I said no then you smoke

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,989
pot you see you feel better what am I

17
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:51,238
gonna do to really show any benefit and

18
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:53,669
said they said well you got to go to

19
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:57,539
Israel and speak to dr. Michelle I'm

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,710
Ruth khalili and Tim Naftali and so I

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,808
went and this is what she showed me in

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,570
in our in one of her ulcerative colitis

23
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:08,519
studies after eight weeks of cannabis

24
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:11,908
treatment and you don't have to be a big

25
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,920
radiologist to sort of see this that one

26
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,469
of the patients had a clean colon

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,200
I said that's interesting but not all

28
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:22,349
the patients had it and what else do you

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,299
have and then she showed me one of the

30
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,658
chrome study she did and she had an

31
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,039
eighty five point seven percent

32
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,990
significant improvement and this was

33
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:33,359
just 30 patients but these thirty

34
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:36,959
patients as dr. door said went through

35
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:38,938
the standard of care and after using the

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,248
cannabis eighty five point seven percent

37
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,139
felt a significant improvement and

38
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:44,519
that's something you know that doesn't

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,890
mean don't see those kind of numbers

40
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,709
every day and they're not coincidental

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,539
and the final thing that kind of got me

42
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,318
he got me interested was the

43
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:58,710
corticosteroids now we had 30 patients

44
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:01,170
and 26 of them we're taking

45
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:03,748
corticosteroids and after the canada's

46
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,670
treatment only four now that may be like

47
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:08,460
something you're not interested in or a

48
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,250
nice number but if you look at the side

49
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,129
effects of oral corticosteroids use long

50
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,068
term you know you have vulnerability to

51
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,930
infection diabetes hypertension the fact

52
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:21,659
that we can get the patients off oral

53
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,120
corticosteroids in the long term i think

54
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,859
was in that kind of seal that there's

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,610
something going on here and there's

56
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,610
something worth pursuing

57
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:33,679
the history of tikkun olam so i decided

58
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,900
obviously to do it the history of tikkun

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,810
olam was in 2002 was started as a

60
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,260
non-profit company basically for

61
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:47,330
holocaust survivors and veterans for

62
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:48,769
more for PTSD 2005 we got a licen the

63
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,070
first license from the government of

64
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:55,370
israel and in 2012 they started

65
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:59,090
producing cannabis for medical use and

66
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,920
dispensing even today one out of every

67
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,590
three patients get their cannabis from

68
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,199
Tekin along in israel um

69
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,009
now in the u.s. it's a total different

70
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:10,280
story

71
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:15,469
no doctor michelin isolated discovered

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:18,110
THC in 1964 and it took till 1981 to get

73
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:21,109
a drug on the market with had some

74
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:24,020
cannabis usage and then four years later

75
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,790
a Marinol to rabinaw and sessom that

76
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:29,360
other two drugs that are on the market

77
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:32,329
for for use in nausea and vomiting see

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,670
inv and you know before I started doing

79
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,410
this I was thinking you know I'm an

80
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,089
analyst and you have two drugs on the

81
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:40,430
market and everybody's saying this is a

82
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,770
billion dollar industry yet these two

83
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,819
drugs haven't really done that well or

84
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:49,280
really haven't been used and it was

85
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:53,060
further research I realized that these

86
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,430
are synthetic THC s it's probably less

87
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,860
than 10% absorbed with Marinol and

88
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,990
actually the market is is a lot bigger

89
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:06,110
once we get to the botanical products

90
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:08,360
2010 yet sativex by GW which was only

91
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:11,170
approved in Europe for spasticity due to

92
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,890
multiple sclerosis it's a 50/50 product

93
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:18,289
50 THC 50 CBD and before we heard

94
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:22,120
explanation why it's not in the US but I

95
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,230
know they're working on for for pain and

96
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,290
probably they will be filing at some

97
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,569
point earlier this year a liquid form of

98
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,210
Marinol was approved and it was approved

99
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,529
at schedule two and the other Marinol is

100
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:35,120
Schedule three and you're trying to

101
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:37,099
figure out why why is this being

102
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,050
approved that's scheduled to more severe

103
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,520
and the answer is that did they do

104
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,680
likability studies and

105
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,799
apparently they were able to abuse this

106
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,740
more like dumping cigarettes in whatever

107
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,689
was so and basically that's the approval

108
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,120
and finally we get to happy dialects

109
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:55,728
which is a major victory for this

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,319
industry as having a botanical product

111
00:04:55,728 --> 00:05:01,728
approved by the FDA and the bigger

112
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:06,020
provement is that a schedule five which

113
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:08,568
is the least the least severe of all the

114
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:10,698
of all the different schedules and

115
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:13,150
schedule five means you could use it

116
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,348
off-label and you could probably get

117
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:19,008
insurance reimbursement that remains to

118
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:22,219
be seen and this is just a quick chart

119
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:25,129
of the DEA scheduling of drugs you know

120
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,039
yeah just like I spoke before cannabis

121
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:33,500
the THC is still scheduled one for Noah

122
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:35,598
with heroin LSD and MD MD at tikkun olam

123
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,029
since we essentially long since we

124
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:42,978
launched the medical since we trust the

125
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:44,929
medical dispensary we decided to

126
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:47,300
actually follow the patients and give

127
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,310
them questionnaires to figure out what

128
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,680
these patients are taking what diseases

129
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,139
they're they're taking them for and how

130
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,769
it's working we've got a database of

131
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,939
close to 20,000 patients now and

132
00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:02,060
obviously growing every day as we

133
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:05,569
dispense more cannabis and if you look

134
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,879
94 percent of the patients so

135
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:11,028
improvement in their condition and 62

136
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,680
reduced medications which I'll come to a

137
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:14,990
little bit later which i think is one of

138
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,310
the most important things of cannabis is

139
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,810
that we can reduce toxic medications

140
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,810
this is a study we released early in the

141
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:28,848
year to prospect this study on

142
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:32,089
on cancer patients their usage and the

143
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:34,879
efficacy of medical cannabis it's with

144
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:37,310
the lihi bar LAIV who Schindler who's

145
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,139
our medical director in Israel Victor

146
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,348
Novak who is our clinical director and

147
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,569
if you need a paper rough dr. michele

148
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:50,149
has to be on the paper so we have all

149
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:52,580
the guys on this paper so this is the

150
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:53,689
indications that we found for useful

151
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,079
middle cannabis 60

152
00:06:53,689 --> 00:07:00,528
none of the patients are from cancer

153
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:02,028
symptoms 24 pain and as we move down we

154
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:06,769
see you know others there for other

155
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:11,808
diseases the the we screen 3:30 845

156
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:14,509
patients and 209 20 923 responded to the

157
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:18,139
questionnaire this is their you know the

158
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:21,229
severity of this is in in six months a

159
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,788
quarter of the patients died so our debt

160
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:29,058
that what we're working on is probably

161
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:30,918
close to 2,000 patients and these are

162
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:34,119
the malignancies they had that breast

163
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:36,948
most had breast cancer lung cancer

164
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:39,199
pancreatic all the cancers that are

165
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:43,309
typically found but the majority with

166
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:46,579
breast and lung the symptoms it's an 8

167
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:48,979
on the pain scale 8 is a very is 8 out

168
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:51,918
of 10 it's a very severe amount of pain

169
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:53,928
that these patients had they had sleep

170
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,808
problems you know their digestive

171
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:58,038
problems all the anxiety depression

172
00:07:55,809 --> 00:08:00,739
nausea vomiting of course all the

173
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:05,178
typical symptoms that you would see with

174
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:07,008
cancer patients and if you see the

175
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:11,598
global assessment they after six months

176
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:14,149
it's pretty amazing that 50.8% felt they

177
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:17,838
had a significant improvement there it's

178
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:20,988
34 and 10 in terms of slide and moderate

179
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:23,809
so we had a 9 to 5 point 5 percent

180
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:26,328
improvement in patients however they

181
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:28,009
they felt it was but I think it's very

182
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,538
important that that's that's a big

183
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,259
number and I think we should really keep

184
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:35,149
that in mind going forward the quality

185
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:38,120
of life before and after you see as

186
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:41,360
things moved along the this after six

187
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:46,039
months we had 611 felt there probably of

188
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,750
life was good and 199 very good and if

189
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:52,818
you've been around cancer patients these

190
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:54,740
are very significant numbers and so this

191
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:57,708
is these are the symptoms and the change

192
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,970
after six months and you could see the

193
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:05,199
sleep problems 16% disappeared an

194
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,330
improvement was 70.8 I think sleep

195
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,920
has a lot to do with getting better I

196
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,710
think at peace people are sleeping

197
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:14,169
better they have a much better chance of

198
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,420
improvement you see anxiety and

199
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:19,620
depression you know a lot of people like

200
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:23,620
seventy five percent felt improvement

201
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:26,740
digestive problems and and nausea and

202
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:30,149
vomiting of course which is the old then

203
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,710
the tried and true reason for cannabis

204
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:35,110
here's the adverse event you can see

205
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,620
it's pretty pretty good only eight

206
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:41,080
percent has some dizziness dry mouth

207
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,669
increased appetite so it's kind of

208
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,570
consistent of what we'd expect with

209
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:49,870
cannabis and in terms of treating cancer

210
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:54,040
pain it's probably better than any drug

211
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:57,190
that's out there so so this is I think

212
00:09:54,039 --> 00:10:00,579
if if you want to do the important slide

213
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,320
in my presentation is this slide and if

214
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,360
you could take away because this is what

215
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,370
I think will lead to for us to do more

216
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,500
studies and other people out there doing

217
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,799
more studies if you look at the first

218
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,470
line you have people who stopped taking

219
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:17,229
opioids we have 36% and we're talking

220
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,560
about a pain of eight which is very

221
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,779
significant 38 36 percent stopped taking

222
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,659
their opioids and nine point nine

223
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:28,029
percent and decrease their dosage this

224
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:30,579
is something that's about 50% of

225
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:32,259
patients were off the opioids and that I

226
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,240
have to tell you what's going on today

227
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:36,580
with opioids in terms of addiction and

228
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,700
I'll come back to it a little later but

229
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,889
I think this in itself propels us to

230
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,670
start doing some studies in terms of

231
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:47,529
replacing opioids with with cannabis if

232
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:51,669
you look at Anzio lytx the you know sort

233
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:56,490
of like the volumes of the world 23.8%

234
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:59,199
stopped taking them corticosteroids

235
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:03,090
twenty thirty one percent stop taking

236
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:07,960
corticosteroids and obviously

237
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:10,450
antiemetics and nausea 67.3% so these

238
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,600
are and laxatives because obviously if

239
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,660
people stop taking opioids they they

240
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,750
don't need to laxatives because opioids

241
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:23,649
you know can cause

242
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:24,580
tremendous issues with so I think but

243
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,339
but I think what we should be

244
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,528
concentrating is on the opioids and how

245
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,050
these patients stop taking the opioids

246
00:11:29,528 --> 00:11:33,399
and I think you'll be hearing from us in

247
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:40,659
the near future in terms of doing

248
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:43,000
Studies a quick discussion of the the

249
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,399
study just so you don't think we're

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,089
everything was great

251
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,559
well the treatment was effective

252
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,450
heterogeneity we had I used a

253
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:53,939
heterogeneous population from a few

254
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:57,009
months to 99 years old 18.8 patients

255
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,399
discontinued treatment so some people

256
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:03,490
kind of just didn't help and the other

257
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,379
issue was self-reported and what we need

258
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,778
to do obviously is to establish a

259
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:09,789
national and international clinical

260
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:13,838
investment program an investigational

261
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:16,740
program to prove these results back to

262
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,990
the opioids currently the CDC statistics

263
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,269
115 15 American's die every day from

264
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:26,278
opiate overdose forty percent of the

265
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:30,458
patients involved prescription opioids

266
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:32,230
and from a financial burden on the on

267
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:35,469
the country seventy eight point five

268
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:39,970
billion a year is caused because of the

269
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:43,450
people of using opioids at ticking along

270
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,129
we're gonna go further and do many more

271
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,640
studies these are the studies that are

272
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:51,009
scheduled to be done the Krone study as

273
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,909
dr. door mentioned we just released some

274
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:58,870
data in Europe on Crohn's we had

275
00:12:54,909 --> 00:13:01,740
remission we had quality of life we're

276
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:05,078
going to do the other data in terms of

277
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:08,379
internal colonoscopy we did have

278
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:10,719
decreased in colonoscopy in in patients

279
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:13,629
taking cannabis we also had a little bit

280
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,310
of decrease in placebo so we're gonna

281
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,828
have to work our way through that in

282
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:20,469
terms to understand what why that was

283
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:22,870
the case it was eight weeks I I suspect

284
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,550
if we take it longer to six months we

285
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,049
probably will see a differentiation

286
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:31,029
between between the Crohn's patients and

287
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:33,250
the placebo

288
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:36,610
we're doing an acute migraine headache

289
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:38,409
study we started we're doing agitation

290
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,810
and Alzheimer's we were more than

291
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:42,939
halfway through that study and the

292
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:47,459
results are looking pretty good we're

293
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:50,170
going to start an autism study very soon

294
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,210
Tourette syndrome we're doing an orphan

295
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:54,639
drug and the most important we have to

296
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,980
prospective study papers coming out

297
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,139
probably before the end of the year

298
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,289
one is an autism in a hundred and eighty

299
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:04,600
eight patients where we these patients

300
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,980
were taking cannabis obviously the data

301
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,690
will be good otherwise I wouldn't be

302
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,820
mentioning it and I think you guys

303
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,040
should keep an eye when it's the most

304
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:15,160
patients that have ever been reported

305
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:16,959
upon in the autism and we will be doing

306
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:21,610
a fibromyalgia we have a fibromyalgia

307
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,530
paper with 367 patients so that's in the

308
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,269
near term I think you it would be very

309
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,899
helpful to kind of keep an eye on that I

310
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:31,689
think all of us are in the in trying to

311
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:33,879
make these studies and increase the

312
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,740
clinical data because only that's the

313
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,960
only way things will change I think if

314
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,850
we increase the clinical data mainstream

315
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,910
physicians will start using crowd will

316
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,620
start using cannabis I think ultimately

317
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:47,079
the political people will pick up on

318
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,090
that and I think that will be the

319
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,120
beginning of a turnaround for the use of

320
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,120
cannabis in sick patients thank you

321
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:01,389
[Applause]

322
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:11,969
hi thank you very much for that

323
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:15,099
presentation going back to the opiate

324
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:17,290
reduction use I saw a column that said

325
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,509
new medications what are the new

326
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:22,480
medications that they they took after

327
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:24,250
reducing their opiate use I don't

328
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,200
remember that it basically was simply we

329
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,480
stayed on opioids there was no new

330
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,480
medication the new medication may have

331
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,028
been the opiate the cannabis but these

332
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,980
patients were taking Canada specifically

333
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:37,960
and they stopped their opioids there

334
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,730
were no other medications at all I see

335
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:46,180
thanks awesome hi thank you so much for

336
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:49,300
your presentation okay the question is

337
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:52,299
in the scientist dr. Michelle um talks

338
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:54,579
about the possibility of cannabis for

339
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:56,620
type 1 diabetes and I was wondering if

340
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,810
that's on your list also um it's I've

341
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,419
seen some animal data out of Hadassah

342
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:04,000
they showed it to me I don't think we're

343
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,829
ready for that now but I'm sure down the

344
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,080
road either we'll be doing it someone

345
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,639
else will be doing it but they have what

346
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,500
I've seen that's to be very good animal

347
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:16,360
data thank you can you speak to any

348
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,240
randomized control trials being done

349
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,600
with Parkinson's disease we've done some

350
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,600
preliminary studies in Parkinson's they

351
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,029
they found it to be safe it's been

352
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,430
effective but we're not at right now

353
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,990
doing any kind of large-scale studies

354
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:34,209
but I know there are other companies

355
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,149
doing it and it would make sense that

356
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,620
Parkinson would be since it's a

357
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:40,870
neurological disease it would make sense

358
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:45,879
that at some point someone would be

359
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:47,529
doing some studies on the two minutes hi

360
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,450
are there any studies being done

361
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,980
comparing delivery methods of

362
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,410
cannabinoids for things like Crohn's

363
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,639
disease such as inhaling it versus

364
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:56,860
putting it in the gut

365
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,649
either in a capsule or suppository I

366
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,060
mean the we're thinking of that and I'm

367
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,579
sure other the thing about right now

368
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:06,609
we're using sublingual we found out to

369
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,019
be we've done PK studies and we found

370
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:12,049
that to be the best route of administer

371
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:14,720
bypassing liver in terms of oral you

372
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:17,269
have to get some specialized some

373
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,700
specialized drug delivery to avoid

374
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,139
metabolism by the liver I'm sure there

375
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,450
are people working on that right now

376
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,370
we're very happy with the sublingual use

377
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:28,970
but at some point I think we'd have to

378
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:32,389
get a little more sophisticated and but

379
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:37,700
right now is for Crohn's and others

380
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:39,320
we're doing the sublingual drops thank

381
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:44,330
you for your presentation

382
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:47,000
the 18.8% that dropped out first I don't

383
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:49,879
recall if you gave a dose of THC and CBD

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,410
and secondly do you think they dropped

385
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,750
out because the treatment was not

386
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,430
effective as opposed to adverse effects

387
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,609
I think they dropped out because the

388
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,980
treatment was not effective and I'm sort

389
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:02,599
of happy when I see things like that ice

390
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,339
when I see side-effects when I see

391
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,519
people dropping out because ultimately

392
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:10,339
our goal is to get to get the THC or the

393
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,500
CBD to be a drug and if you looking you

394
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,629
know any kind of PDR anything every drug

395
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,359
has side effects and it doesn't work in

396
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,490
everybody so I'm quite happy to see it

397
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,069
not working in certain people thank you

398
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:26,660
I don't recall did you listen no we

399
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:29,240
didn't list of this I said thank you are

400
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,390
there any studies being done for mental

401
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,359
health conditions to avoid the heavy

402
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,509
duty drugs that are being we're not in

403
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,779
doing those studies but I think

404
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:42,980
ultimately you know if we're doing

405
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:46,399
Alzheimer's agitation in terms of

406
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,200
reducing agitation I think it to be

407
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,690
quite possible in autism where you're

408
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,029
kind of reducing aggressiveness I think

409
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:56,180
there's a place for that study but we're

410
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:59,619
not we're not doing it round of applause

411
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,620
please for Sid tubman field
