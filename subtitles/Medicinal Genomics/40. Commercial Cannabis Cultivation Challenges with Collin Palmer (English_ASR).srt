is the chief experience officer at

vessel life science colin has been

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,759
obsessed with growing cannabis since he

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,039
started growing in his backyard at 15

76
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,120
years old

77
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,840
since then he has consulted with many

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,560
cannabis companies on a variety of areas

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,039
including genetic selection lab

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,959
optimization product development

81
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,959
branding and more

82
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,959
over the past several years he has

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,959
worked on bringing that experience to

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,039
vessel life science which has been

85
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,598
focused on working with several brands

86
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,560
to bring new solvent-less products to

87
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:39,119
market in 2022

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,439
during our conversation we cover

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,360
colin's journey in the cannabis industry

90
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,799
starting with his first plants to his

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,280
current projects

92
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,159
the education and mentorship he received

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,318
from cannabis cultivation pioneers

94
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,239
how regulations create barriers for

95
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,238
legacy growers to participate in the

96
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,878
current cannabis industry

97
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
how business pressures stifle innovation

98
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,280
from commercial cultivators and

99
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,479
encourage copycat tactics

100
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,280
why thc and cbd values alone do a poor

101
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,759
job of describing cannabis products

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,640
the fact that how and when cannabis is

103
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,120
harvested cured and dried can influence

104
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,039
taste and experience for the user

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,439
why plant pathogens seem to be more

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,840
prevalent now than ever before

107
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,560
how plant pathogens especially hop

108
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,679
latent viroid can destroy a cultivation

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,240
business

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,400
subtle cues that hop latent viroid

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,079
infected plants can show

112
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,758
and more

113
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,079
before we get to my conversation with

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,560

143
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,799
pleasure to be here

144
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,638
all right um so i'm really excited to

145
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,319
talk with you today because i know you

146
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,560
have a lot of experience and a lot of

147
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,360
different areas of cannabis cultivation

148
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,918
from from breeding to extraction i

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,479
couldn't even call it from seed to sale

150
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,399
and i know in our email exchange before

151
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,680
we started recording we identified a

152
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,599
couple different topics that we want to

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,600
cover but i thought before we get into

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
that a good way to get started might be

155
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
it might be appropriate for you to tell

156
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
the listeners a bit about yourself how

157
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,080
you got started in

158
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,000
how you got started in the industry and

159
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,120
what you're doing now

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
yeah so

161
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,478
thanks for having me um you know the

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,959
cannabis plant has been a part of my

163
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,560
life since i've been a young guy being a

164
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,599
you know

165
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
you know

166
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
15 16 years old i started growing my

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
first plants

168
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,959
really

169
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,359
in an amateur sort of way being

170
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,038
influenced off of books from mel frank

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,840
and things that i was reading a lot of

172
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,360
pop culture kind of influenced me from

173
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,478
the grateful dead scene to the fish

174
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
scene

175
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,519
and of course other styles of music like

176
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:00,879
jazz

177
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,758
um so

178
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,918
you know i got really excited about

179
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,479
plants um at a really young age and

180
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,478
cannabis was um to me at the time really

181
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,879
the ultimate plant to explore

182
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,719
um there was a lot of uh it was very

183
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,879
apparent very quickly

184
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,280
that there was a lot to this particular

185
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,839
plant and a lot of um

186
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,399
a lot to explore so um you know whether

187
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,560
that be uh different types of varieties

188
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,879
or you know just a plant morphology in

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,959
general was very interesting at the time

190
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,879
and that really you know drove me into

191
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,079
looking and reading and researching and

192
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,439
it drove me to places like you know

193
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,359
laughingmoon.com which was uh

194
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,000
run by a canadian group which

195
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,240
you know kind of formed into uh

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,079
you know overgrow.com from the you know

197
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,960
british columbia growers associations

198
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,399
days

199
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,079
and there was a wealth of knowledge

200
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,598
there were you know there are people

201
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:56,478
like vic high

202
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:58,000
and um sub cool and um dave watson

203
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,680
robert clark and and several other

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,439
individuals that were posting

205
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,280
information that i could quickly grab

206
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,478
onto and start to read and start to

207
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,719
iterate on

208
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,159
my own uh version of what that was at a

209
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,479
young age

210
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
um and you know

211
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,639
i you know immediately i've been an

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,639
artist my whole life and um i started

213
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,598
studying horticulture um in a really

214
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,079
serious way as i got into my 20s

215
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,360
um i went to school for art and design

216
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,120
and science

217
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,479
and i studied organic chemistry during

218
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
that time

219
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:32,240
i went to school in new york and had a

220
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,839
really big deep dive into that world of

221
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,839
looking at um

222
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
you know this just organic chemistry in

223
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,279
a really

224
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,560
open-minded way and that's what led me

225
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,559
to uh

226
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,000
cannabinoid distraction and really

227
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,919
starting to learn

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,879
about what that was you know i just

229
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,639
immediately started washing hash in 1999

230
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,639
and that was my first forte into

231
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,278
actually extracting any type of

232
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,080
cannabinoid from the plant um and any

233
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,000
type of chemical you know so to speak so

234
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,160
it was you know those days it was a hot

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,519
wash it was you know ice and water

236
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,679
middle of the day or mixing with a

237
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,278
wooden spoon or a spoon and then you're

238
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,239
drying it in these large patties

239
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,278
creating pretty much charis which is a

240
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,919
you know

241
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,679
a type of hash that's a cured resin

242
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,039
that's an air dried resin

243
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,159
and through that time you know you

244
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,399
started

245
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,639
you know started noticing

246
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,120
the nuances of extraction through that

247
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,039
that simple process but it also got my

248
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,799
curiosity into solvent-based extraction

249
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,000
so i started you know playing with

250
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,439
ethanol and

251
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
as soon as the other types of

252
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,959
extractions came around i was naturally

253
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,639
just interested

254
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,278
but circling that back into where i

255
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,600
began and why um you know it was really

256
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,278
um the idea of art and science merging

257
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,000
together that really caught my attention

258
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,919
to this is that you know plants were

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,919
like art you grow these things and

260
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,838
they're immediate art is very immediate

261
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,919
it's a very immediate

262
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,839
function that you and reward that you

263
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,519
you can you know give yourself

264
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,279
and i really enjoyed that simple

265
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,799
pleasure of that so that's where the

266
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,320
idea of growing lots of different

267
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,240
varieties

268
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,560
at a young age came into play because it

269
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,159
was very fascinating to see a california

270
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,239
orange next to

271
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,759
a skunk or

272
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,560
an nl5

273
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,519
you know sitting next to a strawberry uh

274
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,559
cough or a sour diesel and you could see

275
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,480
the the

276
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,879
not only the polymorphic you know

277
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,120
differences but the aromic properties

278
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,879
and and the actual

279
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,639
you know just the the presence of the of

280
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,399
the plant structure itself

281
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,439
really was immediate in terms of the

282
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,519
reward that you saw and then the

283
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,399
exchange of information between

284
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,000
you know comparing and contrasting those

285
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,720
it was really interesting to me and it

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,120
really just drawn me in and drew me into

287
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,519
the world of just getting into reading

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,759
everything that dave watson had you know

289
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,839
put out and skunk man sam had put out

290
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,919
and diving into robert clark's

291
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,839
literature and then going even further

292
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,719
you know going into real

293
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,320
you know

294
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,278
looking at white papers that i could

295
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,760
find

296
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,320
um and ultimately becoming friends with

297
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,319
uh you know marcus richardson who is a

298
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,278
dear friend of mine and somewhat of a

299
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
mentor

300
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,958
at an early age of all this

301
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,480
we were exchanging lots of information

302
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,559
and um

303
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,639
yeah so it just kind of snowballed from

304
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,838
there but it was really the intent and

305
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,000
the uh

306
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,760
the ideology that we could we could

307
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,679
learn more about this plan and it was

308
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,360
immediate and we could actually react to

309
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,159
it

310
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,560
that

311
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,600
simple thing actually

312
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,599
through the years you know grew into

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
what i would consider today

314
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,639
an actual business which i didn't really

315
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,920
plan for

316
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,600
at all um i wasn't you know i never

317
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,838
really bel it's not that i didn't

318
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,639
believe i didn't really know where this

319
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,560
was all headed um and i knew at some

320
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,799
point we would be able to grow these

321
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,919
plants and mass population as we see

322
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,599
today

323
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,278
there's you know there's more people

324
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,560
growing this plant than there ever has

325
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,320
ever in the world so you know with that

326
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,159
comes what we see

327
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:12,000
of an industry there's the good bad ugly

328
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:14,399
and um you know the the the legacy

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,360
farmers and then there's the the new

330
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,559
uh

331
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,759
you know individuals that are coming

332
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,679
into the industry that are now

333
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,799
interested because of um

334
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,719
you know interests that are that are

335
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,319
beyond the plan you know which quite

336
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,278
frankly yeah the plan is a part of it

337
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,480
that the driving factor is not the plan

338
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,958
um

339
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,480
in most cases

340
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,199
yeah

341
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,519
so

342
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
you started when you were 15.

343
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,560
yeah you must have had um

344
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,720
either some

345
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,159
understanding parents or some parents

346
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
who weren't paying much attention which

347
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,679
was it

348
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,639
um i had some parents that were

349
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,838
understanding and um also cautious at

350
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,639
the same time

351
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,600
um

352
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,959
you know i i think you know my my dad um

353
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,240
was really encouraging and he

354
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,119
you know he didn't actually believe that

355
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,360
i could manage all of it honestly and

356
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,200
when he saw all of it he he kind of

357
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,519
chuckled and said well

358
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,120
at least they know what you're good at

359
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,639
and uh

360
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,639
you know

361
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,320
you know i i was obsessive you know like

362
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,159
every day after school straight to the

363
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,920
patch you know and this is outdoor at

364
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,360
the time you know the indoor was really

365
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,120
um difficult at the time you know a

366
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
young guy like that you're not growing

367
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,320
going under lights like that it's uh you

368
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,039
know

369
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,120
but um what i would say is um it was it

370
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,439
was uh all i thought about all i could

371
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,560
think about um every day day in and day

372
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,040
out um that art and music were the the

373
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,638
three things for me that were

374
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,639
just all-encompassing it's all i cared

375
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,320
about um and still to this day it's

376
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,039
quite frankly it's all i truly care

377
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,480
about um and um

378
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,519
you know it's

379
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,879
it's interesting you know it's um

380
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,240
like music um cannabinoids are really um

381
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,000
dynamic and

382
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,320
and like harmonics you have this moment

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
where things come together and dissipate

384
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,839
and that's um

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,159
that's cannabinoids to me in a in a

386
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,360
nutshell after you've uh combusted them

387
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,559
you know or or you utilize them for um

388
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,480
for delivery

389
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,559
so you know they have this beautiful

390
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,320
harmonic frequency that they bring to

391
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,399
your body and your body is able to grab

392
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,278
onto your endocannabinoid system which

393
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,000
is very individual just again just like

394
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,198
how sound travels to your to your your

395
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
nervous system

396
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,838
the rest of your body

397
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,759
so

398
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,720
with that said you know

399
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,600
i had an opportunity to build a company

400
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,000
in uh in in the you know in the state of

401
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,519
massachusetts so i spent um

402
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,078
you know the past three four years of my

403
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,600
life dedicating my time and um

404
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,479
to bringing all the things that i've

405
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,159
researched um and consulted on

406
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,079
because i was a consultant before i went

407
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,000
after my my own license

408
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,519
and i was working with several different

409
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,278
outfits to optimize their workflow

410
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,560
lab workflow their sku creation

411
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,399
you know their branding their

412
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,000
go-to-market strategies

413
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,000
um how

414
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,519
a product sits in a market

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,600
and why

416
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,839
that said sku should be made

417
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,240
and these are questions and things that

418
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
need answers to that

419
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,278
you'd be surprised not many people have

420
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,560
answers to them

421
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,519
um in in the market today um

422
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,278
so

423
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,240
i think there's a big big white space

424
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,360
right now

425
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,278
um and there continues to be um because

426
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
the spirit of cannabinoids is still

427
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,439
widely under

428
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:34,239
really understudied and underutilized

429
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,160
um so yes we have products we have we

430
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,440
have things that we grab onto such as

431
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,159
tack and

432
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,000
you know the the ideology of terpenes

433
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,399
and in by volume

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,360
um but these are widely uh understudied

435
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,159
and under underutilized in terms of um

436
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,759
quantitative and qualitative results you

437
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,198
know so

438
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,560
when you look at these things you know

439
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,559
we we're

440
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,958
at this moment in the industry there's a

441
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,879
really great opportunity for innovation

442
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,278
and um

443
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,039
and uh you know expansion in the terms

444
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,958
of product skus and offering and

445
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,480
delivery for the human

446
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,359
we really aren't

447
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,199
where

448
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,440
most individuals want us you know

449
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,120
believe that we are which is really far

450
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,800
ahead and we have very sophisticated

451
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,278
delivery systems

452
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,639
um you know it's it's

453
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,439
it's going to take some time it's going

454
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,278
to take the right minds to come together

455
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
yes we have a culture

456
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,480
but

457
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
we don't study

458
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,720
toxicology

459
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,519
in these these environments we study

460
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,360
the plant we study

461
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,440
the chemicals that grow on the plant to

462
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,199
optimize those chemicals to to you know

463
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,279
so we can then utilize them for

464
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,958
extraction but there's there's so much

465
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,639
more to explore

466
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,719
and um

467
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,600
you know it's it's a it's a really

468
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,000
exciting time because i think everyone

469
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,278
um has an opportunity to really have a

470
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,639
voice right now

471
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,078
and the industry really needs um

472
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,519
needs innovation

473
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,399
yeah you know

474
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,759
we're i feel like we're kind of

475
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,839
stuck in a vacuum and a lot of respect

476
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,199
yeah no i i think it's interesting you

477
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,639
say that that

478
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,640
you know maybe the industry is not as

479
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,520
far as long as we like to think that it

480
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
is so

481
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,720
where do you

482
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,600
where would you like to see it

483
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,120
um

484
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,240
see it go

485
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,438
you know it's a good question um

486
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,440
i i'd like to see us go into more um

487
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,519
you know real research on on these

488
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,120
chemicals and better testing standards

489
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,200
for um

490
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,839
you know building the right testing

491
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,600
procedures to actually tell the a larger

492
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,359
and more detailed story

493
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,719
right now it seems like we're about five

494
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,319
percent of

495
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,679
the chemicals we're

496
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,439
we're testing for about five percent

497
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,360
right now it seems you know based on

498
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,240
what what is known that is there on the

499
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,599
plan

500
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,519
versus what

501
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,038
um the test results that we get back

502
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,839
from these labs

503
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:00,160
and um that doesn't really give you much

504
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,000
insight you know it's very top it's not

505
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,240
even top line it's it's just very

506
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,400
overview and very general

507
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,759
um so i'd love to see a standardization

508
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,519
but i also

509
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,839
don't through that

510
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,079
through that lens i don't believe we

511
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,918
should be hindering labs because they

512
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,038
need to be developing new standards

513
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,880
along the way

514
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,839
yes we need to agree on something but we

515
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,200
also need to let them

516
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,759
innovate and and collaborate with policy

517
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,319
makers to help them understand

518
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,599
the intricacies of you know testing for

519
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,000
these chemicals

520
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,839
um you know i see

521
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,319
you know a lot of different states have

522
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,918
a lot of different types of mandates for

523
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,960
different requirements that they have in

524
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,840
their rules and regs and you know if we

525
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,279
can't all agree on something

526
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,639
behind the scenes i think it's

527
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,038
problematic

528
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,720
state to state it just it really becomes

529
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,798
difficult

530
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,960
if you're an operator in florida

531
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,918
you have sops that are specific to that

532
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,360
state and those mandates you go to

533
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,679
california

534
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,639
are those the same sops and how do you

535
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,120
standardize a product across

536
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,640
markets if you don't have the

537
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,678
standardization

538
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,200
um

539
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,679
you know from the from a testing

540
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,679
standpoint

541
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,559
so um and and you know i'd also like it

542
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,080
to go into um

543
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,079
you know just want to add this is that

544
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,960
you know there's a lot of legacy growers

545
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,798
that

546
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
have put

547
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,319
more work in than they can actually talk

548
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,279
about in a bed

549
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,119
and the um the path that they've walked

550
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,879
is a path that has been

551
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,319
extremely stressful and dangerous for

552
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,679
them and their families and their

553
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,359
communities

554
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,280
and i feel that

555
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,879
sometimes yes

556
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,359
it's hard to run a business and not

557
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,280
everyone's fit to run a business but

558
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,079
i think it's hard to swallow when we

559
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:54,480
don't have a path for people to

560
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,798
create a business

561
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,079
in a market or

562
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,319
if you want to call it a state or

563
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,960
whatever you want to call it

564
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,558
for these individuals to live on and to

565
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
pass those torches on you know you're

566
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,879
talking about generational growers and

567
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,279
individuals have kept these varieties

568
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,000
that a lot of these big box individuals

569
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,918
are coming in and just getting a cut for

570
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,119
five six six hundred thousand dollars

571
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,480
and

572
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,639
all of a sudden they have a brand too

573
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,480
and they're growing the same varietals

574
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,320
um and

575
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,599
you know it's it's tough to swallow that

576
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:28,879
there's um

577
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,918
you know

578
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,520
there's really no one to help

579
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,679
the dying breed of community and um

580
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,960
and culture that that is you know legacy

581
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,679
cannabis

582
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,519
um it's really hard to see so

583
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,240
uh a good example of that is is where

584
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,200
we're at in california um and i think

585
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,079
you know if we can have better policy

586
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,200
um better cooperation from

587
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,879
you know

588
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,640
how things uh had run from 215 to 64 to

589
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,480
where it's going now

590
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
um i think the conversation could be

591
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,240
steered and

592
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,319
we get to have a better future for a lot

593
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,960
of these individuals that are truly

594
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,240
truly here for the plant truly here for

595
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,600
um

596
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,960
you know the best

597
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:17,119
resin the best uh terpenes that they can

598
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,880
they can grow on the plant and the the

599
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,959
fullest expression these these specific

600
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,720
rivals that they can't get so

601
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,558
i'd love to see a path for everyone to

602
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,960
participate legacy the corporations

603
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,678
the you know the niche

604
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,038
um you know and that's what i'd like to

605
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,679
see yeah

606
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,599
and how much of it is

607
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,759
sort of over regulation creating

608
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,719
barriers for some of these like you said

609
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,200
legacy growers or those who don't have

610
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,400
you know endless funding to sort of pay

611
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,480
for all the necessary licenses or

612
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,159
requirements that the regulators set

613
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
forth like how much of that is the issue

614
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,000
with

615
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,839
kind of

616
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,038
gatekeeping these folks

617
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,918
i think it's i think it's a lot of um

618
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,240
over

619
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,759
regulation in terms of the

620
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,839
the steps you have to go to get to

621
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,000
market and what you have to pay for to

622
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,359
get that product in market

623
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,599
and what the

624
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,639
the pit stops of of that cost structure

625
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,639
meaning

626
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,240
if i pay for testing

627
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
if i'm making water hash let me just use

628
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,079
an example i'm i'm testing the flour i'm

629
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,679
testing the water hash and i'm testing

630
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,720
the rosin right that's three touch

631
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,200
points of rosin earth of testing

632
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,279
that um could be

633
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,640
you know half the cost of the overall

634
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,158
grant

635
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,600
um and

636
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,640
you know if you're not doing large

637
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,639
batches the state is going to tax you

638
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,320
based on that number and the times that

639
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,919
you're testing and then it has to go to

640
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,119
distribution and they have to do their

641
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
own

642
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,158
right

643
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,679
so there's there's um

644
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,000
there's too many pit stops and um

645
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,360
the cost to do these things

646
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
amounts

647
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,399
to you know just pricing yourself right

648
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,880
out

649
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,200
you know so i think that

650
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,600
that's the biggest problem too and also

651
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
the cost of uh you know cost per gram

652
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,000
now is

653
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,679
you know it's strong in some states but

654
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,839
really weak in others

655
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,280
and it's really hard when you know a

656
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,199
farmer's been

657
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:16,720
doing this for a really long time and

658
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,679
then all of a sudden

659
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,839
you know

660
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,679
yeah they might be making a pound for

661
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,558
450 and

662
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,798
you know

663
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,240
but by the time they add up labor and

664
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,319
testing costs and everything else

665
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,798
they're more like 750

666
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,158
you know and that's a really difficult

667
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,158
thing to swallow

668
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,120
as a business that is growing and young

669
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,760
and you know like i was young once too i

670
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,918
i i learned a lot about business through

671
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,400
lots of trial and error you know and you

672
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,000
know i'm fortunate to have come out the

673
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,120
other end really

674
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,599
sound and

675
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,959
you know better for it but um

676
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,678
you know i didn't have catastrophic

677
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,640
events happen where everything was gone

678
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,278
so

679
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,840
that's that's what i see

680
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,119
just the way that it's evolved is

681
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,720
there's a lot of pit stops and then you

682
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,678
have to deal with distribution which is

683
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,720
kind of

684
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,480
its own beast in itself and um you know

685
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,159
these things need to be streamlined so

686
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
individuals can get product to market

687
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,000
where they're not taxing themselves

688
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
literally out of the market

689
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,558
yeah

690
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,319
all right i want to

691
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,200
switch gears a little bit and start

692
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,960
talking about um genetics because i know

693
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,159
uh you've got quite a collection of

694
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,200
cultivars

695
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,360
uh we've amassed one over the years uh

696
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,919
including some rare genetics some land

697
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,839
ray strains um sorry if you talk about

698
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,240
like what are some of your favorite cuts

699
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,480
that you have or that that are out there

700
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,200
and maybe kind of talk about

701
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,000
what we're seeing in the marketplace in

702
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,159
terms of different varieties

703
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,558
yeah so that's a good question so when i

704
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,360
say we're we're in a vacuum i i i think

705
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,720
um

706
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,959
i think i'm really talking about that

707
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,440
from not only a product's u perspective

708
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,000
but also a varietal perspective um you

709
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,038
know we let pop culture drive a lot of

710
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,798
our decisions as humans around us and

711
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:03,759
and i think

712
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,720
in

713
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,480
the instance that we're in right now um

714
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,319
you know there's there's certain players

715
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,278
in the game and certain individuals that

716
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,798
are um are really pushing their

717
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,440
their point of view in terms of what

718
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,879
they believe is good and that's

719
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,880
resonating with

720
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,320
everybody you know and and back to the

721
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,240
music analogy

722
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,399
um you know there's trends that come

723
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,079
along you know their styles of music and

724
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,919
their styles of genetics that are going

725
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,319
to come along and we're all going to

726
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,240
start doing that type of style

727
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,119
to stay current to say contemporary

728
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,079
right

729
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,479
and um you know cannabis has just like

730
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,480
music has vintage varietals it has

731
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,038
classic varietals it has

732
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,240
the backbone and the the language of in

733
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,240
which we

734
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,038
you know are the building blocks if you

735
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,159
will of of it all you know it's the

736
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:56,079
your your

737
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,760
your nl5 and your your skunk one and

738
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,599
your haze

739
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,519
and then moving forward from your haze

740
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,798
you have your modern haze which is the

741
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,960
jack herrera which is kind of been

742
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,558
you know again that's another bridle

743
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,240
that is in a vacuum you know it kind of

744
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,440
does chirps that terpenolane just kind

745
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,679
of took over

746
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,880
um jack carrera was probably you know if

747
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,080
i was i'm

748
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,840
kind of

749
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,599
you know making a joke about it he's

750
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,678
kind of like the first kind of uh

751
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,839
influencer you know that was ben donkers

752
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,679
kind of took jack carrera and utilized

753
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,918
him as a as an influencer and and

754
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,880
created the varietal around him right

755
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,200
and that was really to curb the sativa

756
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,840
to be more commercial to be a 16 12 you

757
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,000
know 12 16 week variety could be

758
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,798
um could be actually 11 12 weeks you

759
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,599
know

760
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,798
so

761
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,839
um i think you know genetics today

762
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,599
um

763
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,558
you know i think we're getting a little

764
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,480
not bottlenecked but um you know i think

765
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:53,200
just in the commercial sense

766
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,278
we're all growing the same things

767
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,480
um and we're all trying to package them

768
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,038
differently

769
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,599
and they're predominantly the same

770
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,798
and you know yeah this guy may have used

771
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,678
more sugars in week seven than the next

772
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:07,679
but

773
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,600
predominantly at scale in a commercial

774
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,600
setting you know there's it's all the

775
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,678
same stuff you go on everyone's menu

776
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:17,199
it's a version of each other

777
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,440
um and you know look the cannabis is

778
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,360
it's such a vast

779
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,558
i mean look at the canopy it's such a

780
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:27,278
vast sea of amazing

781
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:30,398
uh chemotypes and phenotypes and i i

782
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,319
wonder um yes i understand in commercial

783
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,359
that we we have to stay within certain

784
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,678
scheduling but i always wonder

785
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,918
why we pigeonhole ourselves to

786
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,960
try to try to get things out onto a

787
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,200
market to just stay relevant um and you

788
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,038
know listen i i'm a true believer if

789
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,679
you're not innovating you're dying

790
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:52,319
and if you're just buying and saying

791
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,000
growing the same cuts everybody else is

792
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,319
that's not innovating to me

793
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,240
you know um and there's just so much

794
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,319
good stuff out there you know i have

795
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,599
older land race stuff that i was gifted

796
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,918
that you know

797
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:06,079
i would still consider a hybrid of of

798
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,600
sorts you know sure it's it's

799
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,278
quote air quotes uh land race but um

800
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,439
you can see the expressions out of these

801
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,599
plants that they're um they're robust

802
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,919
they have great resin production

803
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,398
their you know terpene profiles are

804
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,799
super intense they're a bit more spicy

805
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,319
and a bit different than you know a lot

806
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,398
of these contemporary varietals but

807
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,319
they're very special

808
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,879
very different um

809
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,079
in terms of how they produce and and

810
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,120
and all the things that go along with

811
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:38,000
that so um i i would love to see people

812
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:41,359
start to explore um

813
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,319
you know just new new avenues um and

814
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,519
yeah

815
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,839
the thing that's really interesting to

816
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,319
me is like flavors now this idea of

817
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,240
flavors right are all being repackaged

818
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,319
and represented to us but

819
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,399
i mean none of this stuff is really new

820
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,639
in terms of taste right i mean all these

821
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,719
flavors have been here um

822
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,480
you know when gmo came through it was

823
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,000
just like a really great super skunk to

824
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,839
me you know it just started really

825
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,240
producing

826
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:09,119
it had this really dank you know

827
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,960
beautiful um you know chem d feel to it

828
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,798
but it was tight and better better you

829
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,960
know tighter structure so that's where

830
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,639
the girl scout cookie came in on that as

831
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,079
an example of the contemporary variety

832
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,480
that everyone grows

833
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,079
and look most of these things are grown

834
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,200
time and time again because it's

835
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,558
horticulturally sound to do that it's

836
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,640
at scale

837
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,480
you know it's why people love to hate on

838
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,399
blue dream but man if you've ever grown

839
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,120
that variety it's it's

840
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,798
it's pretty great to grow i mean yeah do

841
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,319
i do i think there's much better things

842
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,558
yeah but but

843
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,079
in that moment you see why you're like

844
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,079
oh yeah okay

845
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,000
it's insane that's a great plant it's a

846
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,158
grower's plant so

847
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,919
on the flip side og kush is not really a

848
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,320
grower's plant it's really sparse it's

849
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,440
really lanky it falls over all the time

850
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,879
it needs lots of support so you know in

851
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,640
commercial settings those plants are

852
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,600
hard to grow and they don't yield much

853
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,360
you know

854
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,119
so

855
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,678
my point is is that

856
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,038
there's a lot to explore

857
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,559
there's a lot of great breeders out

858
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,398
there today that we just didn't have

859
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,480
before um you know you could really

860
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,798
count them on your hands for a while you

861
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,480
know it was really that was it and and

862
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,440
beyond that was like you know of course

863
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,839
you know

864
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,720
the common turn a pollen checker right

865
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:25,439
um but you know let's face it most of

866
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,440
our contemporary and you know varietals

867
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,880
that we have seen through the 90s were

868
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,278
all bag seed

869
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,960
chem 91 chem four

870
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,000
you know ken juan you know

871
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,720
sour d all these things were not

872
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,880
actually bred by someone intentionally

873
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,319
um they were

874
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,360
people that were good stewards of the

875
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,319
plan

876
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,319
so um with that i you know

877
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,720
i encourage people to explore explore

878
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,240
the bag see that you were going to throw

879
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,640
out

880
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,200
grow seeds and you know be a good

881
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,320
champion a good steward of them

882
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,240
i'm not saying you're going to find the

883
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:05,038
next chemd but i think it's good to

884
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,079
live in that world of um

885
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:09,679
i want to explore and you know in the

886
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,879
world of discovery

887
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,880
yeah

888
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,080
no and it sounds like from what you're

889
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,760
saying that

890
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,278
sort of all the overhead all the

891
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:21,440
additional testing all the licenses

892
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,278
is sort of stifling innovation right

893
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,880
because you want to grow these plants

894
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,798
that are going to yield the most and

895
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,278
that are proven

896
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:31,918
uh winners in retail too like they're

897
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,519
gonna they're gonna sell so right sort

898
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,159
of the appetite to really put yourself

899
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,519
out there and take a risk is not really

900
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,320
there

901
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,079
yeah and especially when you have um

902
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,398
you have people to answer to right if

903
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,839
you're let's say your company that has a

904
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,199
set schedule and you only have a certain

905
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,959
amount of rooms

906
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,278
you can only produce a set amount of

907
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,798
pounds per month per year

908
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,720
you have to stick to the schedule

909
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,038
because that's tied to other things that

910
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,440
are way outside of creativity right

911
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,919
these are these are hardline things that

912
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,120
don't incorporate creativity but i have

913
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,120
to

914
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,239
to remind everyone and invite them to

915
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,000
say look

916
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,839
then you need to build creativity into

917
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,038
the business plan because if you don't

918
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,158
have it

919
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,319
then

920
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,120
what are you truly doing you're just you

921
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,119
know

922
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,879
is that is that uh

923
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,479
is that what you want you know

924
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,480
um so

925
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,120
that's one thing i would i you know i

926
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,278
truly look at a lot as um how people are

927
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,918
looking at the world around them and the

928
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:33,200
the space that they occupy

929
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,440
and um you know again it's it's

930
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,360
retail is predominantly not all that

931
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,759
different than one another go to another

932
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,918
shop it's just a different registers and

933
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,319
to the left instead of the right and

934
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,960
there might be a touch screen in that

935
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:50,240
corner instead of the left hand side

936
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,038
corner right but predominantly the

937
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,679
education isn't really there yet and we

938
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:59,599
don't have the language quite yet to be

939
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,240
educational on a sales floor and to be

940
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,759
able to talk about a varietal in a way

941
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,960
that actually

942
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,119
um

943
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,480
does its justice you know is is really

944
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,199
it's tough man

945
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,038
um but it's uh it's something that i i

946
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,960
really hope that we can get

947
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,640
a good handle on in the next you know

948
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,079
five to ten years and

949
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,679
start to develop language around um

950
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,000
you know the right way to talk about

951
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,759
cannabis it's it's really hard man as

952
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,599
much as we all think we know we just

953
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,599
don't know yeah

954
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,918
no and you're spot on with you know the

955
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,000
retail experience being

956
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,919
being very similar i mean i i can only

957
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,960
speak really to here in massachusetts

958
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,038
and i know it might be different in

959
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,880
other states but sure i mean you you

960
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:41,759
look at the menus and it's all the same

961
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,880
stuff

962
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:47,200
um they're only really reporting on thc

963
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,799
cbd content they don't even really talk

964
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,120
about the terpenes

965
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,960
and it's it's sort of like how am i

966
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,839
supposed to know

967
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,640
if one's better than the other um right

968
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,759
and

969
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,120
i mean it's all thc dominant too like

970
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,879
you rarely ever see a one-to-one or any

971
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,480
other even just

972
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,960
different ratios of cbd to thc let alone

973
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,519
uh turbulence so yeah i agree with you

974
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,039
there's just a huge fact

975
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:18,639
yeah we need to be exploring more

976
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,398
cannabinoids um i i

977
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,399
you know to your point to the one to one

978
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:23,918
point i you know one to one two to one

979
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,000
three to one uh

980
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,440
twenty to one you know forty to one i

981
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,918
mean listen

982
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,440
there's a lot of um

983
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,279
there's a lot to be explored with how

984
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,200
cannabinoids interact with one another

985
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,240
and then how that interaction interacts

986
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,918
with you

987
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,598
and to you your point here um thca and

988
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,759
th delta nines

989
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,399
ruled the game right it is

990
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,119
is the selling a quantitative selling

991
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,960
point for for bud tenders right now and

992
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,119
i have to say this out loud that is

993
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,599
completely a false

994
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,160
sense of reality

995
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,480
that is not going to tell you

996
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,719
anything about what that varietal is

997
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,800
going to do for you individually

998
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,199
at all it's going to give you a glimpse

999
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,200
into what the testing told you

1000
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,639
what could possibly be there by mass by

1001
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,838
weight right

1002
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:16,559
um and you know furthermore

1003
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:20,239
it's not telling you how that variety is

1004
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:23,599
was taken down or trimmed or cured

1005
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,719
and uh are the the trichome heads cloudy

1006
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,359
or amber

1007
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,159
um things like this are

1008
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:32,319
are wildly left out of the conversation

1009
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,598
and you know harvest date you know when

1010
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,440
was it harvest

1011
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,039
do you buy do you buy based on

1012
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,119
expiration date i mean when you go into

1013
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,000
whole foods you buy based on expiration

1014
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,079
date

1015
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,679
and the back label

1016
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,359
right and

1017
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,598
the unfortunate part about cannabis is

1018
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,838
we can't lead with the back label quite

1019
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,079
yet but i think that what we can do is

1020
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:55,358
we can look at the chemical properties

1021
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,000
by volume and generally start to draw

1022
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,759
these correlations between what your bio

1023
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,760
assay is telling you

1024
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,000
and you can start physically

1025
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,440
kind of in your you know in interacting

1026
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,280
with this product

1027
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,838
in a way that tells you the results so i

1028
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,359
do think that there is value in the data

1029
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,119
i think we need to start looking at it

1030
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,838
from educational standpoint and better

1031
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,519
build better language around it so then

1032
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,759
the blood tenders that we give these

1033
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,960
amazing products to can actually talk

1034
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,560
about them

1035
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,119
and have a person walk away with some

1036
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,799
sort of subtype of substance

1037
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,920
that allows them to be better educated

1038
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,680
and better for it yeah

1039
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,320
no it's a great point you make about you

1040
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,719
know how it was aged or how it was cured

1041
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,480
and you know i always sort of

1042
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,118
draw the analogy whether appropriate or

1043
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,599
not to to alcohol right like

1044
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,760
a lot of whiskey products are

1045
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,838
are marketed based on you know how they

1046
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,480
were aged which type of barrels they

1047
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,078
were put in so i mean the whole concept

1048
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,960
shouldn't really be foreign to people

1049
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,079
that

1050
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,838
you know we could be looking past just

1051
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,280
data points that come out of the lab

1052
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,639
that there there's more to the end

1053
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,320
product than that

1054
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,679
that's right and you know back to this

1055
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,920
one to one thing i want to touch on that

1056
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,519
just one more time is one of my favorite

1057
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,039
varieties for

1058
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,759
searching for those types of things is

1059
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,400
the work that ringo did ringo's gift and

1060
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,359
the varieties that come off of that um

1061
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,880
harlequin is another one from um

1062
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,880
wade laughter

1063
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,160
house of harlequin has been a staple i

1064
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,880
think in those types of

1065
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,319
ratios of cannabinoids and the work that

1066
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,640
he has put in

1067
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,280
um over the years to to make sure that

1068
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:36,480
those varieties are in circulation is

1069
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,000
is really inspiring in stellar work um

1070
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,119
you know cantatonic is another great

1071
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,320
variety

1072
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,000
um

1073
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,599
so there's there's there's quite a few

1074
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,280
and that's just me you know throwing a

1075
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,960
few out there but um

1076
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,400
yeah those are some varieties i think

1077
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,159
would be uh

1078
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,240
great to explore and there's a lot of

1079
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,279
possibilities there

1080
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,039
now

1081
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,640
kind of going back to that whole idea of

1082
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,000
drawing the parallels to

1083
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,078
alcohol

1084
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,760
um do you ever see envision a future

1085
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,920
we'll have something that's similar to

1086
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,160
like say craft beer where we have more

1087
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,880
craft cannabis like these smaller

1088
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:12,719
growers who maybe do smaller batches

1089
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,640
of these more unique varieties

1090
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,159
i know it doesn't sound like given the

1091
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,358
climate today that that's really

1092
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,118
feasible but

1093
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:20,719
you know potentially

1094
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,160
that would be i mean that'd be great

1095
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,838
right

1096
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,239
yeah i think i think it would be great

1097
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,239
um you know

1098
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,639
boutique cannabis is um you know

1099
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,719
cannabis is a perishable um i just want

1100
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,799
to start saying that uh let's have to

1101
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,719
get that in there um cannabis is a

1102
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,720
perishable and you know there's a point

1103
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:42,000
when you do have too much

1104
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:44,159
um you know and i think that's something

1105
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,880
not everyone has the foresight to to

1106
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,960
check themselves on um when they start

1107
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,000
looking at balance sheets and you know

1108
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,199
pounds per month it starts just you know

1109
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,960
you get in a different mindset and i i

1110
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,879
invite everyone to look at this from a

1111
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,199
more practical standpoint

1112
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,119
and you know ask yourself could we be

1113
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,439
better for it if we focus on other

1114
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,160
things rather than more

1115
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,800
um you know look at the industrial age

1116
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,639
it's mediocre products for mediocre for

1117
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,400
a mediocre environment

1118
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,598
and um

1119
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,039
that shouldn't be cannabis um i i don't

1120
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,640
you know sure there's people that want

1121
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,480
that angle and you have to kind of ask

1122
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,159
yourself who you want to be

1123
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,519
but um

1124
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,519
yeah you know i think that there's a

1125
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,759
world where craft canvas

1126
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,159
is what people

1127
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,240
truly want and i think that's the world

1128
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,159
that we're going to that will shape up

1129
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,319
eventually

1130
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,519
you know if we can learn from

1131
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,280
all the other markets that have

1132
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:43,119
developed around us

1133
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,400
and and you know specifically a federal

1134
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,358
market

1135
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,240
you know going big is not has not really

1136
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:53,039
worked out and um you know growing an

1137
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,519
ornamental crop like cannabis

1138
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,279
is very difficult at scale and you have

1139
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,119
to be you know your teams have to be

1140
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,960
firing off on all cylinders everybody

1141
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,960
has to be in great communication the

1142
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,000
systems have to be running great

1143
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,318
in most all cases that's not the case

1144
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
you know and

1145
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,759
that's problematic i think for high

1146
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,960
quality cannabis and and all of these

1147
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,640
things that we've been speaking about

1148
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,720
which is getting

1149
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,920
bulbous and capital cecil and capitate

1150
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,039
stocked

1151
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,280
you know resin glands to grow in in

1152
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:26,318
large amounts and the nasal chemicals to

1153
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,960
grow within them um you know you have to

1154
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,719
have um you know you start at 100

1155
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,400
and everything you do wrong knocks the

1156
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,879
point off right

1157
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,480
and it's

1158
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,680
you know whether it's environmental in

1159
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,039
your vpd or ppfd you know you don't you

1160
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,759
don't know

1161
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,519
but

1162
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,119
all of these things together have to be

1163
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,639
in harmony and

1164
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,559
those that harmonics has to come

1165
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,199
together um together

1166
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:53,920
in a really methodical way to make high

1167
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,598
quality cannabis at scale happen

1168
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,720
and i don't think the world's seen that

1169
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,880
yet i think we've seen some pretty

1170
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,039
you know some pretty great things happen

1171
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,720
i think the the industry is evolving in

1172
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,559
a really interesting way but there's a

1173
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,719
lot of a lot of room there for

1174
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,519
improvement and and

1175
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:14,000
i invite everyone to look at you know

1176
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,280
just because you can should you

1177
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,800
yeah

1178
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,880
no that's a good point about you know

1179
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,800
growing at scale

1180
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,400
and kind of going back to this whole

1181
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,079
idea of

1182
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,160
you know the everyone's growing the same

1183
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,200
thing and how much of that is that

1184
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,318
because

1185
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,838
you know if you were growing all

1186
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,960
different types of varieties you're

1187
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,559
going to have to have them in different

1188
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,599
environments that are sort of best

1189
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,679
suited for those plants and like that's

1190
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,599
just that's just not gonna work

1191
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,078
we're not there yet you know in terms of

1192
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,400
you know genetics um

1193
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,960
you know look

1194
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,200
we're super far away from this idea of

1195
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,240
standardization and maybe there are

1196
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,598
teams that aren't sharing the

1197
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,919
information that i don't know about

1198
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,838
which is entirely possible and i always

1199
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,039
say this if you're thinking about it

1200
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:58,880
it's happening

1201
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:00,559
um you know

1202
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,079
it it

1203
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,679
we have a long way to go to say that

1204
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,318
these varieties should be grown in these

1205
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,719
regions at these temperatures

1206
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:11,039
um we've just a lot of data to collect

1207
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,118
and a lot of breeding to do

1208
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:15,039
um to be able to get the the genetics in

1209
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,280
a place like that um

1210
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:21,440
but you know i hope one day we we have

1211
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,960
some ideology um around that but i don't

1212
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,800
at the same time i want to say this as

1213
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,480
well it's like i don't

1214
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,560
in this in the pursuit of

1215
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,318
standardization let's not lose sight of

1216
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:36,239
creativity and the fact that f1 and

1217
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:38,480
the idea of of not leaving an f1 is um

1218
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,639
is exciting now i think that the

1219
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,880
industries pigeonholed itself to not go

1220
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:45,039
past f1 because people are just moving

1221
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,880
on too quick right

1222
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,559
but to standard you know stabilize

1223
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,318
something to have something that's truly

1224
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,679
unique in uniform

1225
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,759
i think um

1226
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,759
you know we have we're a long ways away

1227
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,640
from that

1228
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,000
yeah

1229
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,318
and i guess another thing that kind of

1230
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,358
just struck me too is you know

1231
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,599
if

1232
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,000
you know until the industry sort of

1233
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,480
keeps up and they're able to to innovate

1234
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,920
and and grow these different varieties

1235
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,240
i mean i guess there's always the option

1236
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,800
to to grow yourself right to home grow

1237
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,879
and that's a good way to express

1238
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,560
or to connect everybody varieties

1239
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,160
everybody should grow at home everyone

1240
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,480
should have plants at home i think they

1241
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,279
you know look growing cannabis is very

1242
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,000
hard it's not an easy task and i think

1243
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,359
it's important for people to understand

1244
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,679
um

1245
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,679
understand that it's it's uh

1246
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,000
again back to music it's like music you

1247
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,679
can grab a guitar from from a guitar

1248
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,039
center but you still have to learn how

1249
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,239
to play it before you get in front of

1250
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,318
people and that's similar here you gotta

1251
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,679
learn and go through it and understand

1252
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,400
what uh

1253
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:52,159
what spider mites are um well nowadays

1254
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,119
what what pm looks like you know and um

1255
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:57,279
what the hop laden viroid uh might look

1256
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,519
like you know these are all things that

1257
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,040
um you know those are two newer things

1258
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,159
that we didn't have

1259
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,759
as prevalent back uh in the early 2000s

1260
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,759
and late 90s but

1261
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,960
these are things that you have to go

1262
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,800
through i think

1263
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,440
and sometimes listen you can grow some

1264
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,599
amazing stuff and you can have your own

1265
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,920
your own version of what you see around

1266
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,200
you in pop culture

1267
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,119
so you mentioned pm and

1268
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,639
and viroid kind of being these

1269
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,880
newer issues on the scene that

1270
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:28,159
cultivators have to deal with

1271
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,000
uh i guess i was more familiar with

1272
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,318
hoplate and viroid sort of being newer

1273
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,639
but it was interested to hear that pm

1274
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:36,639
wasn't as much of an issue uh years ago

1275
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,799
when you were first getting started

1276
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,440
yeah no you know i

1277
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,200
yeah honestly um

1278
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,559
you know

1279
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:50,078
those types of diseases um

1280
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,880
i was not pre you know i i was not aware

1281
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,318
of

1282
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,440
you know

1283
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,599
in

1284
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,440
let's say 99 2000 2001

1285
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,960
and then that's when i started reading

1286
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,720
more about

1287
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,318
powdery mildew

1288
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:08,480
and seeing more powdery mildew um being

1289
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,880
passed around through cuts or

1290
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,159
friends that were you know saying hey my

1291
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,920
my whole grows bond out what do we do

1292
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:19,118
and that's where products like green

1293
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,960
cure came in and

1294
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,559
you know sulfur and all these things

1295
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,679
were being talked about

1296
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,679
at a at a time like that now

1297
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,358
was uh pm

1298
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,879
a disease that's been identified yeah

1299
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:34,480
absolutely

1300
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,400
but for myself and other growers um

1301
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,280
we were not um

1302
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,240
as as infected by things like that at

1303
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,720
all

1304
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,799
um sure you'd see the case of like you

1305
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,039
know mites and stuff but

1306
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,640
again we didn't have russet mites right

1307
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,920
we didn't have

1308
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:51,920
these super bugs that

1309
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,079
took out whole gardens in the matter of

1310
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:56,879
you know 72 hours

1311
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,920
so

1312
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,838
it's

1313
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,960
you know those types of things were

1314
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:04,318
really new at the time and then you know

1315
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,838
that you know of course we made all

1316
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:09,199
kinds of bad mistakes everybody used

1317
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:10,000
eagle 20. i mean gosh it was it was bad

1318
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,519
um

1319
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,760
you know and again this is all because

1320
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,358
we didn't have anyone to talk to

1321
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,680
there's if if we had a bigger

1322
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,358
pipeline of communication everyone could

1323
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,358
have been better educated at the time

1324
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:25,920
and we just weren't yeah and i think

1325
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,679
that's highly contributed to that

1326
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,960
and then fast forward to today with

1327
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:32,719
hoplade and viroid you know um

1328
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,039
we had identified a couple plants that

1329
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:38,559
came from a nursery in california that

1330
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:41,519
um were hot for hlbp and with top lane

1331
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,440
viroid and um

1332
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,199
you know it's

1333
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,639
it's it's heartbreaking to see things

1334
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:48,879
like that because we don't have the

1335
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:51,519
right guidance um that's publicly

1336
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:55,599
available and a roadmap that doesn't

1337
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:58,239
cost you 12 months and and 15k

1338
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,240
to get a varietal clean again and the

1339
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,318
best answers i've gotten were call the

1340
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,719
plant today or

1341
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:07,358
you could go into the deep dive right so

1342
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,719
how you know as a community do we

1343
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,039
start to talk about this and have

1344
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,118
dialogue on it to help

1345
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,838
help each other

1346
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,480
not have this type of viroid wreak havoc

1347
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,480
on your businesses because

1348
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,719
cannabis has always been kind of loose

1349
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,719
right like yeah it's weed we grow plants

1350
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:28,879
you know but today it's not loose it's

1351
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,399
tight it's there's margins there's

1352
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,200
people that have their whole lives on

1353
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,280
the line and a viroid like this will

1354
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:37,358
wipe out your whole business

1355
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,839
and from growing these plants and

1356
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,279
studying a hotblade enviroid in confined

1357
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,480
spaces

1358
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,839
and having my own bio assay with it

1359
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,519
as i call it

1360
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:51,039
you can see how

1361
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:52,400
it performs and adversely could totally

1362
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,599
ruin everything

1363
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,358
i mean

1364
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,039
the way that the flower structure grows

1365
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,279
on these plants versus plants that don't

1366
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,759
have it is night and day

1367
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,079
um and if you didn't know what you were

1368
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,920
looking for you would never know

1369
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,760
you just said oh that's a low yielding

1370
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,680
yielding plan that's just one that's the

1371
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,240
way she is

1372
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,159
that's not the case um oh she's you know

1373
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,719
they didn't produce enough terpenes this

1374
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:19,118
run well no it's because it's sick how

1375
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,879
does a human perform when you're sick

1376
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,720
right how is the plant supposed to

1377
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,519
perform when they're sick

1378
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,118
so

1379
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,599
those are the things that we have to be

1380
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,838
really um we used to be looking out for

1381
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,119
not only ourselves but each other

1382
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,039
because

1383
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,119
one day you're going to want to cut from

1384
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:37,119
your buddy who's going to be happily

1385
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,200
giving it to you

1386
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,200
and you're going to then grow it and

1387
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,039
start cloning other things with it not

1388
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,118
even knowing because it's your buddy and

1389
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,199
you trust your buddy

1390
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,519
and your buddy's just a nice guy and

1391
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,039
he's unbeknownst to him he's passing you

1392
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,679
know hot blade and viroid to your whole

1393
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,279
garden and it's it's a it's a domino

1394
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:58,078
effect of just

1395
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,079
great intentions with the worst outcome

1396
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,480
you know and and that's what i see today

1397
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,480
is you know nurseries they have all the

1398
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,760
best intentions you know we all do we

1399
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,519
all have great intentions but um if if

1400
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,040
we're not checking ourselves and that's

1401
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,358
why i think you know the work that

1402
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:14,558
medicine genomics is doing is super

1403
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:15,358
important

1404
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,000
um

1405
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:21,279
to the future of where agriculture and

1406
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,519
and horticulture is going for cannabis

1407
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,280
um because we need

1408
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,119
to have the insight

1409
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,839
to be able to make better decisions that

1410
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,358
are educated based on

1411
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:32,159
cleanliness

1412
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:34,558
uh

1413
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,078
vigor and fit to perform

1414
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,480
you know and and

1415
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,880
if these things aren't done

1416
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,280
one day we might find uh sour diesel

1417
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,599
chem 91 and chem d completely out of our

1418
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,400
language because the last man standing

1419
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:52,000
got got hlv because

1420
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,000
he uh took a cut from his buddy

1421
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,318
yeah i mean and that is sort of the most

1422
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,280
at least in my mind the most kind of

1423
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:00,558
insidious thing about it is that it's so

1424
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,680
like you said

1425
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,280
unless you knew what you were looking

1426
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:06,480
for you wouldn't you wouldn't know you

1427
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,319
even had it i mean things like pm

1428
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,159
um it's pretty obvious you know you have

1429
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,880
white splotches all over your plant like

1430
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,118
oh i got pm but up late and viral it's a

1431
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,800
lot harder to identify

1432
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,039
yeah it's impos it's not impossible that

1433
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,880
it's it's um from a visual standpoint

1434
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:22,960
there are cues that i've been learning

1435
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,599
that the plant will give you like

1436
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,639
like your stems will just snap like

1437
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,359
clean

1438
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:31,279
like surgical clean bone snap right in

1439
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:33,119
half um

1440
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,920
it's like cucumber almost it's like a

1441
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:39,440
cucumber snap so you start to pick up on

1442
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:43,119
these these these cues that six plants a

1443
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,880
sick plant will give you but um again

1444
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,960
there's no

1445
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,599
real literature that will say that it's

1446
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,720
definitively can be eradicated from the

1447
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,800
plant quite yet there's there's some

1448
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,358
and if someone does out there on this

1449
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,760
it's a listener under no away

1450
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,078
please reach out and um we'd love i'd

1451
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,640
love to speak with you on to how

1452
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,920
you're approaching um you know you know

1453
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,078
eradication

1454
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,760
um because you know most of the things

1455
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,160
we see

1456
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,000
are you know therapies and in different

1457
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:16,960
you know tc and meristem

1458
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,960
um you know paths to to do it however

1459
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,838
there's been no definitive evidence that

1460
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,880
it doesn't come

1461
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:25,039
back and this is probably a dumb

1462
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,400
question but i'm going to ask it anyway

1463
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,838
um

1464
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,720
i i read that it's not common for hlvd

1465
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:35,039
to be passed through seas so

1466
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:38,480
what about sort of selfing a sick plant

1467
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,480
in trying to grow from those seeds

1468
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,318
um you know i think there's

1469
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,719
i think i think that needs to be studied

1470
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,480
more um you know i i

1471
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,558
i've i've heard that you know five

1472
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,599
percent of the seed could be infected

1473
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,680
right um

1474
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,079
you know i

1475
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,919
it's really who knows i think that's

1476
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,839
that's the the larger

1477
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,318
honest answer there

1478
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:01,838
but um i think that larger populations

1479
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:05,199
and studies larger studies need to be

1480
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:07,039
done to better identify what um is being

1481
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:08,159
passed on and

1482
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,880
you know

1483
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,279
again it needs a host right so how is

1484
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,640
the seed going to be a host um

1485
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,280
you know so there's a lot to to learn

1486
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:21,358
but uh i think that you know

1487
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,480
that's a really good point you know i

1488
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:25,519
i'm not sure if an s1 would do the trick

1489
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,280
um

1490
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:28,880
but i think it's something that you know

1491
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,800
again we need we need

1492
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,559
more long-term studies we need some

1493
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,720
we need to really understand it

1494
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,400
yeah absolutely i mean it's a lot of

1495
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:40,318
work to be done on that front

1496
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,000
all right um i definitely do want to be

1497
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,679
mindful of your time calling and thanks

1498
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,199
so much for taking the time but before i

1499
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:48,000
let you go i want to give you a chance

1500
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:49,679
to plug any website social media any way

1501
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,199
people can get in touch with you or or
