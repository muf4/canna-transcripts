1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,888
last year I spoke on autism and this

2
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:10,809
year I really wanted to address epilepsy

3
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:14,320
which has really been the the majority

4
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:16,390
of my career and an incredibly important

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,089
topic for me personally not just

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,850
professionally and I'd like to dedicate

7
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:23,859
really to talk to say I'll get emotional

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,070
but patient mind and city may Meehan who

9
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:29,830
we lost in March last year to epilepsy I

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,929
I apologize if I broke up on that but

11
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,460
she's a beautiful girl who I took care

12
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:35,948
of since infancy I had the great

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,730
pleasure of knowing she passed in at age

14
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:39,128
13

15
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:41,979
due to her seizures and it really it

16
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:43,718
highlights the importance of really

17
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:46,199
improving what we do for patients with

18
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,939
epilepsy she taught me a great deal

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,980
personally I'm professionally as did her

20
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:53,229
mother Susan Meehan and I'm sure some of

21
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,849
you probably know her it's worth noting

22
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:58,119
Dustin Sulak who's speaking tomorrow

23
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:01,899
also took care of Cindy Mae and you know

24
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:04,838
was just very warm and very involved

25
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:08,500
with the family and so that's why we do

26
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:11,739
what we do is to really to help patients

27
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:16,030
and to avoid such a such a devastating

28
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:17,949
consequence so when a new therapy comes

29
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,569
up and this is something that we've had

30
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,728
to approach in both autism and epilepsy

31
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:24,368
is we've had a lot of new therapies and

32
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:25,868
it's not always clear upfront what what

33
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:29,618
do we do what's the best approach and

34
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:31,090
what's safest for the patient so it's in

35
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:34,060
terms of my approach to this and this

36
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,250
really began to arise more in autism and

37
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,390
epilepsy when I first started out but we

38
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,489
have to first we have to learn as much

39
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,629
as we can about the treatment and we

40
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:42,910
have to learn as much as we can about

41
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:45,098
the patient because from those two were

42
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,929
ultimately going to balance risk benefit

43
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:49,270
and that that's really what we need to

44
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:53,079
do so so we can provide proper informed

45
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:54,429
consent to the family so some practical

46
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,140
things that have helped me in doing this

47
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:58,659
when we have therapies that are

48
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,368
considered unproven one is to make one

49
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:02,170
change at a time because we have to

50
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:04,450
assess both for efficacy as well side

51
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,450
effect you always want to start low and

52
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,679
go slow when you introduce a new therapy

53
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,289
it's important to define what your goals

54
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,439
are up front so we know at what point do

55
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:15,459
we take away this therapy at what point

56
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,569
you know should we start to take away

57
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,400
some of the old therapies that you've

58
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,609
been on and so what what what's going to

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,050
be

60
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,110
considered success and that sometimes

61
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,060
hard to define and that also requires

62
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,200
very careful assessment of treatment

63
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,580
response and close follow-up and we need

64
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,379
to know - that the therapy itself is

65
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,030
consistent over its time course because

66
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:37,030
we don't want to assume something as

67
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,789
ineffective simply because the

68
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,009
consistency is an issue so in my

69
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:44,049
practice when cannabis was approved for

70
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:46,509
medicinal use I was in Rhode Island at

71
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,219
the time and in terms of knowing the

72
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:50,289
patient I first started with the most

73
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:52,030
medically refractory patients because I

74
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:53,650
figured if we're if we had limited

75
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,250
resources at that time that's what we

76
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,450
needed to really focus on first to make

77
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,789
sure that we're doing it the right way

78
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:02,349
we had no in a small state this was

79
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:04,419
actually fairly easy we only had two

80
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,400
licensed dispensaries at the time so I

81
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,539
met with them we tried to figure out

82
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
what are we gonna use for epilepsy

83
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:11,919
actually when they first opened epilepsy

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,919
wasn't high on the radar so we made sure

85
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,119
that we got the strains we needed and we

86
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,589
figured out what we're gonna use in each

87
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,890
patient and how are we gonna make sure

88
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,390
it's consistent and as we introduced CBD

89
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,759
in this case we started with a CDC

90
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:27,759
strains was about at that time of added

91
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,949
21 CBD to THC ratio we kind of held

92
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,979
their other antisera medications stable

93
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,329
so we did one change at a time we asked

94
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,729
patients to keep very close seizure

95
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,310
journals so we we did epilepsy we did

96
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,439
seizure counts for four weeks leading up

97
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,719
to the therapy with old meds stable and

98
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,419
continued those very close seizure

99
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,669
counts after starting therapy and I did

100
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:51,729
24-hour yuji's before and after each

101
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:53,259
patient and also assessed their anti

102
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:54,729
seizure of medication levels and so

103
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:56,768
that's what I chose to do in my own

104
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,329
practice but at that time I had less

105
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,400
data to tell me it was effective and I

106
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,900
want to really be sure that I wasn't

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,730
leading patients down a pathway of

108
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,260
something ineffective I had seen many

109
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,659
ineffective therapy's along the way for

110
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:09,069
various things and we want to be sure

111
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:11,349
this was really working and those were

112
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:13,810
the things that we did to help ensure

113
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,669
that I'm gonna roll through I have about

114
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,370
a like a two hour talk here so I'm just

115
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,108
gonna roll through it very quickly but I

116
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,019
want to give you some of my challenges

117
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:25,569
in the office and so having it approved

118
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:27,879
by the state is not even half the battle

119
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:29,680
and and the basic summary of all of this

120
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,459
is going to be that the scheduling is a

121
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,280
major major problem in the clinic

122
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:35,899
realm my opinion it in dangers both

123
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:37,549
patients and caregivers in different

124
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:39,379
ways and so scheduling remains a problem

125
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,590
even though we have state approval I'm

126
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:45,079
going to give you examples as to why and

127
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:46,909
so this is a typical patient I'd see

128
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,889
somebody who has dravet syndrome is a

129
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,689
patient with multiple seizure types very

130
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,120
refractory to our existing therapies and

131
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:56,168
that risk these are patients were at

132
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,060
risk of dying from epilepsy and so

133
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:01,399
having gone through this many therapies

134
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,769
none of which were working or causing

135
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,659
side effects you know the mother asked

136
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:08,899
me that question I've heard about this

137
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,000
is this something you can prescribe and

138
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:14,719
have to explain that well I can't really

139
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,970
prescribe it exactly we I can advise

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,710
consideration or I can have a First

141
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,960
Amendment right to a discussion on the

142
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:22,728
topic but we at this stage I still can't

143
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,879
prescribe it I have a DEA license which

144
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:27,769
would prohibit me from doing so and in

145
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,240
Massachusetts we have our own specific

146
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:31,038
requirements each state has their own

147
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,978
Massachusetts for Pediatrics patients

148
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,800
you need to certified physicians you

149
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:37,969
have to state you have to test that the

150
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,680
patient has one of the medically

151
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:44,479
required conditions and it's important

152
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,129
to note that because I can't I am

153
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,228
because I can't technically prescribe it

154
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:50,779
it really affects the way we practice so

155
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:53,269
first of all how do i document that if a

156
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:54,859
patient's telling if i'm helping advise

157
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,839
a patient on to how to start their dose

158
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,879
where to begin it I can't really

159
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,129
document that without that fear that I'm

160
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,019
actually crossing that line from First

161
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:05,569
Amendment free speech into prescription

162
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:06,948
of course that'll discourage physicians

163
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,240
from being involved in this area in the

164
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,030
first place because the rules aren't so

165
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,408
clear it's going to limit our ability to

166
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:14,299
provide written instructions which we

167
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:16,399
should do but of course this makes it

168
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,228
complicated and you know so how do we

169
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,049
chart how do we document these things in

170
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:23,899
our notes and our phone calls in this

171
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,930
patient we she did start an ac/dc strain

172
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:28,250
about a 20 to 1 ratio starting about a

173
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,650
quarter milligram per pound per day

174
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,259
gradually increasing did very well

175
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:35,359
improved alertness improved attention no

176
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,979
side effects seizures pretty

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,240
dramatically improved so she had some

178
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:41,389
breakthroughs during her menstrual cycle

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,360
which is not uncommon but only one

180
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,139
pediatric ICU admission for her in the

181
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,479
last three years

182
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:50,269
is phenomenal and and again potentially

183
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:53,598
lifesaving she was somebody who was very

184
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:56,448
frequently intubated and and often in

185
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,579
the ICU she continues to keep journals

186
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,400
we continue to review her progress with

187
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:02,449
teachers with the parents

188
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,609
neuropsychological assessments are very

189
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,499
helpful I think they should it be great

190
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,939
ideally to do on every patient be

191
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:10,490
wonderful to see how the kids are

192
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:12,229
progressing with therapy and we monitor

193
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,389
of course the consistency of the

194
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:16,158
treatment we can independently test to

195
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:18,680
make sure that that what she's taking

196
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:22,550
remains consistent and we monitor her

197
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,259
anti-seizure medication levels so other

198
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,520
conditions and I'll roll through these

199
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,370
really quickly I won't present the whole

200
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,658
history for each for the sake of time

201
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,158
again though in dravet syndrome

202
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,199
it's very common the seizures remain

203
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:34,908
refractory sometimes very prolonged so

204
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,908
in a patient who has seizures that are

205
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:39,649
20 minutes 40 minutes an hour those

206
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:41,509
become life-threatening and those

207
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,459
present a risk of harm even if not

208
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:46,370
life-threatening even a risk of harm to

209
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:47,989
the brain in a permanent risk and so how

210
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,418
can we treat that well this patient was

211
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:53,060
actually giving and I have to credit

212
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:55,250
doctors who like for starting a few

213
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,990
these patients and and helping instruct

214
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,848
on this but this patient was using THC

215
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,439
issues using about a half milligram per

216
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:04,188
pound in the buccal mucosa for prolonged

217
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,899
seizures and worked tremendously well

218
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:08,870
for her she noticed that before she was

219
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:10,430
using rectal valium which caused her to

220
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,918
be sedated for the entire day and wasn't

221
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,990
working that well in the first place

222
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:17,718
using THC through the buccal mucosa

223
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,550
meaning the cheek seizures were breaking

224
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:21,709
more quickly the patient was back to

225
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,680
herself in about an hour so huge

226
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:27,019
difference and you know now that's a

227
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,149
little that always raises some caution

228
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:30,560
for a clinician because prolonged

229
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,078
seizures are such a potentially

230
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,828
dangerous issue so how do I do that in a

231
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:39,948
way that's safe typically we would treat

232
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:43,250
with benzodiazepine after about five

233
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:44,719
minutes into a seizure so initially when

234
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,399
I where the first few patients came with

235
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,440
this approach or this question to me

236
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,328
what we opted to do is actually treat

237
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,910
them a little bit sooner just because I

238
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:54,500
2 to 3 minute mark because I wanted to

239
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:56,448
still allow time to see if the seizure

240
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,549
broke and then we still had the option

241
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,818
of using a benzodiazepine if need be and

242
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:00,019
that

243
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:02,149
what most of my patients will do they

244
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:04,999
have they had now have two tools in the

245
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:08,328
toolbox they can use the buccal mid

246
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:11,298
THC or they can go back to die stadt or

247
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:15,019
nasal midazolam more standard therapies

248
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:17,778
that they've used for for many years in

249
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:20,028
patient this is this is a daily issue I

250
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:22,788
face this came up last night I got paged

251
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:25,278
emailed multiple people about a patient

252
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:28,879
who's inpatient now this is a very

253
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,769
confusing topic this will happen though

254
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,178
if you treat patients as an outpatient

255
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,739
especially for something like seizures

256
00:09:32,178 --> 00:09:36,048
eventually they're gonna get admitted

257
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:38,798
and we don't have hospital systems in

258
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:41,328
place presently to address this topic so

259
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:43,639
another example the patient she had

260
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:45,409
tried everything nothing worked the only

261
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,389
thing that worked was was she was

262
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:49,338
actually on THC daily for seizure she

263
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:50,720
had tried to see be really a high CBD

264
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,479
product initially which was not

265
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,819
effective she also used THC as a rescue

266
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:57,859
so she was using it both as daily

267
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:59,178
maintenance plus rescue working very

268
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,859
well for her but the problem is every

269
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:02,358
time she had a fever or infection

270
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:06,139
she'd present with a prolonged seizure

271
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:07,819
and sometimes needed a mission so here

272
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,519
you have a patient the only thing that's

273
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:13,158
worked as a cannabis product can you

274
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:17,209
give it in the hospital and if you can't

275
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:20,298
can you stop it is it safe to do that so

276
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:23,028
it's complicated and the short answer is

277
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:24,259
that mufasa 'ls have not worked out a

278
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:25,698
system here where they could do this

279
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,499
legally and the problem remains the

280
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:29,628
federal government plays a major role

281
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:32,178
for hospitals so the Centers for

282
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:35,658
medicare/medicaid their requirement is

283
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:37,788
that if you have your own medication

284
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:39,198
whatever it happens to be whether it's

285
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:41,928
your home medication or an herbal

286
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:43,639
product they they were they demand that

287
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:45,918
the patient give it to the pharmacist

288
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,918
will then confirm what it is and then

289
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:50,720
dispense it the problem is is that if

290
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:52,999
the pharmacist dispenses a Schedule one

291
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,220
medication that's a violation of the

292
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:58,249
Controlled Substances Act so you're

293
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,389
stuck and these federal requirements are

294
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,339
obviously at odds with each other but

295
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:02,959
keep in mind hospitals receive huge

296
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,239
federal funding not just from Medicare

297
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,219
or Medicaid but research funding goes on

298
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:08,389
and on so they don't want to violate the

299
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,329
controlled substance act for those

300
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:12,860
reasons some states have taken steps to

301
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:14,689
correct this

302
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,519
in Connecticut governor Daniel Malloy

303
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,010
did sign legislation to protect nurses

304
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,350
Connecticut Maine are also explicitly

305
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,330
provide immunity to the hospitals but

306
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,379
hospitals are more important in fun

307
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,850
I mean what's more important than is

308
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,649
actually the funding sometimes than the

309
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,570
immunity and it still doesn't fully

310
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:31,909
address the funding question and that's

311
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,680
why you know I say that we we still have

312
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:36,529
to work out the scheduling moves remains

313
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,879
a major issue for the inpatient and the

314
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,829
Controlled Substances Act does state

315
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:41,480
that when you have state and federal law

316
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,300
at odds with each other you have to take

317
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,070
the more stringent of those two creates

318
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:47,419
problem and I'm not a lawyer I don't

319
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,490
want to be one or a politician

320
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:51,439
but we have a lot of work to do here so

321
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,029
because these are the options we face

322
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,380
you can either stop the cannabis

323
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,449
products in which case the patient may

324
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:59,149
go into a prolonged seizure potentially

325
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,129
life-threatening you could have the

326
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,899
patient self administer but then Centers

327
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,820
for medicare/medicaid tell us we

328
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:06,169
shouldn't do that we should actually

329
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,990
confirm what's being given first and

330
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:10,279
then dispense it or you could have the

331
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,570
hospital pharmacists do that and

332
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,669
dispense it but then they're violating

333
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,410
they're violating controlled substance

334
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:17,990
act or you can do a don't-ask-don't-tell

335
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:18,919
policy in which case he does create a

336
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,600
little bit of problem cuz you're not

337
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:22,429
documenting then what what's actually

338
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,550
being given may be an issue if their

339
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:27,709
side effects these the ones I'll go a

340
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:29,059
little faster but second opinions come

341
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,500
up a lot and I see a quite a few

342
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:33,049
patients second opinions this gets back

343
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,190
to why we have to know the patient very

344
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:38,359
well and also so that's one critical

345
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,280
thing the other thing is that we the

346
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,600
physician does need to remain very

347
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,519
involved in the care of all these

348
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,560
patients and this patient highlights

349
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,000
that so this is a ten-year-old boy had

350
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:48,649
been diagnosed another Center with

351
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,139
seizures came to me on six different

352
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,909
anti-seizure meds the mom on her own had

353
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:55,210
started CBD but the seizures were

354
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:57,829
actually escalating upon doing so and

355
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,680
she was wondering is the CBD making the

356
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,020
seizures worse so to figure that out

357
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:05,629
what we did is we admitted him for a

358
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,610
video EEG it turned out the seizures

359
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:09,679
that he was on six medications for and

360
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,000
at the moment start CBD for actually

361
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,459
were not seizures they were what we call

362
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,230
psychogenic non-epileptic seizures as

363
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,940
many as 40 pending on the studies you

364
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,019
look at as high as 40% of patients with

365
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,330
epilepsy will have psychogenic

366
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,889
non-epileptic seizures but of course the

367
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,450
meds weren't working this is not what

368
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:25,159
they work for he did have epilepsy

369
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,390
though so many patients have both

370
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:28,399
they're not exclusive

371
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,289
entities but it explained why the

372
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,090
treatment wasn't working and this

373
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:34,789
highlights the importance of the

374
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:37,040
physician remaining deeply involved with

375
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:38,569
the care of the patient and and and also

376
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,509
why we have to have open discussions

377
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:45,590
about treatment school remains a major

378
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:47,389
issue so many my patients have to this

379
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,180
is an example of patient who is taking

380
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:52,429
strain called auto number two was having

381
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:55,339
afternoon seizures so it was wearing off

382
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:56,989
now if I used a higher morning dose she

383
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,399
was a little more sedated we're trying

384
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,620
to find that balance so three times a

385
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,009
day was perfect for her problem is the

386
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,330
school nurse can't administer you know

387
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,950
that schools again they received title

388
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,350
one funding most schools have

389
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,850
zero-tolerance policies for any drugs on

390
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,560
campus and of course the nurse fears

391
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,350
their own liability and administering

392
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,179
the sort of product so what do you do

393
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,860
and you have I have parents who drive to

394
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:21,649
the school have to take the kid off the

395
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:24,139
school grounds you know I mean my my day

396
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:26,600
is busy enough my wife and I both work I

397
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:29,120
couldn't imagine how you do this but

398
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,879
it's it's not easy but this is what it

399
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,080
has to be done sometimes alternatively

400
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,059
you could just raise the morning dose

401
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,410
but then you might risk sedation you

402
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:38,750
know so you have to be careful we do

403
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,250
have a few schools that have a few

404
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,590
states that have moved towards

405
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:45,500
protecting kids in school and protecting

406
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,090
the school's themselves and they will

407
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,470
allow the legal guardian to administer

408
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,649
the treatment and the students won't be

409
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,000
punished for having them or receiving

410
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:56,149
them so so there is some movement

411
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,519
towards improving this travel of course

412
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:59,840
remains an issue patient of mine this

413
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,789
came up last week so all these things

414
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,610
I'm mentioning like every one of these

415
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:08,240
within the week I've managed this

416
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,950
patient up just last week got a got a

417
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,779
make-a-wish trip to a state where

418
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,660
cannabis is not legal medical cannabis

419
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:17,480
is not legal so the question is she

420
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:19,159
called the TSA TSA said we you're fine

421
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,810
leaving we're not going to do anything

422
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,039
in Massachusetts but the problem is when

423
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:24,529
you get to where you're arriving we

424
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,669
can't guarantee what the TSA will do so

425
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,279
it leads the mom with a couple questions

426
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:30,169
do you bring it in the luggage and risk

427
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,269
dealing with the TSA and in the state

428
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:33,709
you're going to do you FedEx it to your

429
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:36,590
arrival destination that raises other

430
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,690
issues do you hold it for the duration

431
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,280
of the vacation or risk seizures do you

432
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,250
cancel your make-a-wish trip

433
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,939
we just we're looking forward to you

434
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,409
know at all these bad options right I

435
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,730
could tell you I I mean I have little

436
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:51,350
side discussions with patients about

437
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:55,490
what I think they can do but those are

438
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:58,190
many of those are off the record someone

439
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,409
mentioned us so that's why I talked

440
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,210
about that you know politics directly

441
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:05,449
affects what I do day in and day out

442
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,490
this is a big issue it affects how we

443
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,020
document how we counsel what we do in

444
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,720
the hospital setting what I do in school

445
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:14,329
what we do for travel the scheduling

446
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,220
right now from my patients and I see a

447
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,379
subset I see mostly kids with autism and

448
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,050
epilepsy but it puts my patients at harm

449
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:22,820
the current scheduling it also puts

450
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:25,089
physicians nurses pharmacists in the

451
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,290
hospitals at fear of legal jeopardy I

452
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,509
didn't even mention research right

453
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:31,069
that's the whole other topic of course

454
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:32,450
it limits the physicians willingness to

455
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,220
see and treat patients and this is a

456
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,560
major reason why so few physicians are

457
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,680
involved in this it hinders our

458
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,049
inpatient care prevents documentation

459
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:44,059
you know three memnon no charities like

460
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:46,189
the the overriding principle to first do

461
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:48,079
no harm that many physicians operate

462
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,360
under but we have to be careful that we

463
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,580
don't harm patients for fear of all the

464
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,289
legal issues too it's a balance we don't

465
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,089
want to administer treatments that don't

466
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,679
work or harmful but we also want to make

467
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,270
sure that we're not harming patients

468
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,419
because we're overly cautious about our

469
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,990
own liability and so the uplifting part

470
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:06,349
of this

471
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:09,400
this is Susan gonna cry I apologize but

472
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:13,219
this is me and with Governor Malloy and

473
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,650
she worked so hard to get legalization

474
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,600
in Connecticut and was successful and

475
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:21,430
that that happened in October and they

476
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,429
named the law after my patient Cindy Mae

477
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,579
you
