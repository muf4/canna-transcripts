away from canmed 2022.

12
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,718
i for one cannot wait for cam at 2022

13
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,799
but when you consider it's been 28

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,520
months since our last event i guess

15
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,038
three months isn't that long to wait

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,039

at harvard medical school as well as a

82

and today he joins us to talk about the

90
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,639
research that has been done to determine

91
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,399
whether cannabis can be used to treat

92
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,798
covit19 and or prevent infection

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,879
more specifically we discuss

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,438
what role the endocannabinoid system

95
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,639
plays in preventing and clearing a viral

96
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,479
infection

97
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,679
the different levels of clinical

98
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,840
research

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,680
the importance of peer review

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,719
and we also talk about some specific

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
studies

102
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:15,120
most notably the university of chicago

103
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,560
study that claims cbd inhibits sars cov2

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,798
replication

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,358
the oregon university study that claims

106
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,879
cannabinoid acids can prevent covet

107
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,359
infection

108
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,040
animal models showing cbd can calm the

109
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600
cytokine storm

110
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,520
a pre-print study claiming cbd primes

111
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,840
the innate immune system

112
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,639
and we also look at claims that cannabis

113
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,560
smokers have a greater risk of covin-19

114
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,478
infection

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,720
before we get to my conversation with

116
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,758

my conversation with dr ethan russo

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:34,579
[Music]

132
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,478
good morning ethan thanks for joining us

133
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,879
on the podcast well thanks for having me

134
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,719
absolutely all right so

135
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,038
throughout the pandemic we've seen

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,320
headlines about cannabis as a potential

137
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,800
treatment for coven 19. but as is the

138
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,879
case with most things these days it's

139
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,840
hard to know what's real and what's

140
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,000
being sensationalized for clicks so

141
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,918
first thank you for coming on to be a

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,279
trusted expert that

143
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,159
can help us

144
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,799
find the signal and all the noise

145
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,880
well we'll try um you know

146
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,120
a lot of this by saying that there's a

147
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,879
big difference between the way i would

148
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,399
like things and the way that i think

149
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,560
that they are

150
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,318
so let's issue that caveat and this is

151
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,759
where i remind people that my training

152
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,479
is as a neurologist not a virologist but

153
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,919
um hopefully we can translate some of

154
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,680
the

155
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,599
scientific

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
jargon into things that are

157
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,280
understandable

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,399
great so

159
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,079
maybe it's best to start broadly um and

160
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,560
then we can kind of get into discussing

161
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,639
some of these specific studies and and

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,360
see which ones have the most promise

163
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,680
so first given what we know about

164
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,879
cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,038
system

166
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,120
is there potential for cannabis medicine

167
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,959
to be helpful in the fight against covet

168
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
19

169
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,318
perhaps

170
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,080
there are always

171
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,840
there is always more than one

172
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,719
consideration here

173
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,318
um

174
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,199
first would be

175
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,039
uh are there medicines that uh help

176
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,478
prevent infection

177
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,000
uh or

178
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,399
kill the virus

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,560
or in the case of covid

180
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,839
are there things that help with the

181
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,839
aftermath or preventing further damage

182
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,598
people are probably familiar at this

183
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,799
point with the idea of the cytokine

184
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,038
storm

185
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,680
this may have less to do with the virus

186
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,240
itself than it does with the body's over

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,879
reaction to its presence such that it's

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,800
attacking its own tissues particularly

189
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,000
the lungs

190
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,720
so all of these are branch points where

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,038
any medical intervention might help and

192
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,000
so the question then becomes

193
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,759
could cannabis or components help here

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,519
here or here

195
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,080
so all of these things need to be

196
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,120
considered

197
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,878
excellent

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,399
and another thing to consider at least

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,360
when we're kind of looking at the

200
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,439
research that's being put out is

201
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,639
sort of the different levels of clinical

202
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,560
research

203
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,478
and i was hoping you could kind of help

204
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,800
explain that again to kind of set the

205
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,959
table because from what i can gather a

206
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,598
lot of the work that's been done on

207
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,598
cannabis and covid is very preliminary

208
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,120
which means that the results that are

209
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,680
seen there might not hold up when we

210
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,439
start working with actual patients

211
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,439
yeah exactly right

212
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,399
so i mean the first step is looking at

213
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,038
things in the lab uh maybe at cells and

214
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,879
culture and sometimes they do things

215
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:39,918
like use agkl's hek cells which stands

216
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,240
for human embryonic kidney

217
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,120
those are used because they're easy to

218
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
hook

219
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,080
on

220
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,799
cell receptors to

221
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,839
so that you can test the hypothesis

222
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,599
however it's a long way from matt

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,440
to saying that something's going to work

224
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,480
in the human body

225
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,440
so the next echelon up is animal studies

226
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,839
but again do these translate well and as

227
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,959
we'll we'll see sometimes they're

228
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,120
injecting very large doses

229
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,958
into a rodent

230
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,000
and it's not the same as what can be

231
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,879
achieved in a human

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
third

233
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,519
and most important would be human

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,600
clinical trials

235
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,879
and typically these go through three

236
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,000
phases

237
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,320
on phase one is only possible after

238
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,799
you've established to the satisfaction

239
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,440
of the food and drug administration

240
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,199
that the compound you're testing

241
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
is safe and

242
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
not toxic

243
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,519
to a degree that is going to be

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,240
dangerous by itself

245
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,959
after that steps passed phase one means

246
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,320
that you test your drug in normal

247
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,879
patients

248
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,640
or normal participants

249
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,080
to see what its pharmacokinetics and

250
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,199
pharmacodynamics are that's a fancy way

251
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
of saying

252
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,519
how much gets into the blood and what

253
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,839
kind of reactions do people get to it um

254
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,360
then phase two you're actually studying

255
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,000
the disease process and how people

256
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,399
are affected by it so these are called

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,320
safety and efficacy studies

258
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,879
along the way you also have to go

259
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,320
through chemistry manufacturing control

260
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,278
to show that

261
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,519
your

262
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:27,919
study drug is consistent over time and

263
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,078
is made to

264
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,838
what are called good manufacturing

265
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,958
practice standards

266
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,000
finally phase three is in large numbers

267
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,958
of people

268
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,799
again looking at safety and efficacy

269
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,039
if you pass all that

270
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,719
you get fda approval but this is a

271
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:49,519
process that often takes 10 to 12 years

272
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,920
and upwards of a billion dollars

273
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,720
on now with a neutral product there's a

274
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:58,319
possibility of it doing in less time

275
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,920
case in point would be epidiolex

276
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,200
but they are again we were dealing with

277
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:08,958
decades of information regarding the

278
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,800
relative safety of cannabidiol

279
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,639
in humans

280
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:16,719
and then getting it through clinical

281
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:19,838
trials for a very uh important set of

282
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,480
disorders um where basically

283
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,920
conventional medicine has fallen short

284
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
um so

285
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,719
you know it was also under what's called

286
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,600
an orphan designation meaning that less

287
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,639
than 250 000 people in the us were

288
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,120
affected

289
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,838
so that's a shortcut with covid you

290
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,159
wouldn't necessarily have that shortcut

291
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,720
but you may have other shortcuts because

292
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,000
of the uh severity and wide reach of the

293
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,399
pandemic

294
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
uh anyway that's a long-winded answer to

295
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
a

296
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,240
short question

297
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,920
yeah and

298
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,838
at least from what i gather in in the

299
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,319
studies that i sort of put together for

300
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,959
this conversation i didn't see anything

301
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,639
getting beyond animal models is that

302
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,958
accurate

303
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,360
ah yeah

304
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,000
there was on the new yen study that i

305
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,480
just read yesterday this is called

306
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,559
cannabidiol inhibits sars cov2

307
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,039
replication through induction of the

308
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,559
host er stress and innate immune

309
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,278
responses

310
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,759
they did look at humans but in a very

311
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,000
indirect way we could go into that

312
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,360
detail if you like right now

313
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,480
yeah sure

314
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,839
okay so what they did um and this is a

315
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
little bit hazy because in the

316
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,040
methodology section they didn't go into

317
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,879
this in a lot of detail but purportedly

318
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,480
they looked at people

319
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:47,919
who were on a high potency cannabidiol

320
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,680
preparation which i assume was epidiolex

321
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,519
because they described it and it's the

322
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,638
only one i know of

323
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,000
basically 100 milligrams cbd per

324
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,759
milliliter

325
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,519
in patients so this must be epidiolex

326
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,958
um and they looked at the incidence of

327
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
sars

328
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,359
cov2

329
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,519
in patients on that preparation compared

330
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,278
to patients who were not on it and

331
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,919
supposedly

332
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,919
um they were comparable in demographics

333
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,039
but there weren't a lot of detail there

334
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,199
now why is this important well first who

335
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,199
gets epi dialects

336
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,480
it is approved in three groups of

337
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,759
patients those with travail syndrome

338
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,600
lennox gastow syndrome and seizure

339
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,039
disorders associated with tuberous

340
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
sclerosis

341
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,759
these are all generally children

342
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,399
sometimes adults

343
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:47,198
with extremely severe seizure disorder

344
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,198
syndromes and developmental delays

345
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,638
one would have to think that in the era

346
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,278
of covid that these are patients that

347
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,680
are really being sequestered uh by their

348
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,600
family they're not gonna be out and

349
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,919
about and they're not gonna be eating in

350
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,680
restaurants unmasked or this kind of

351
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,120
thing so

352
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,919
could the

353
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,159
uh was there a benefit to them being on

354
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,879
this high potency cannabidiol

355
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,039
preparation or was it more that they've

356
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,519
been isolated

357
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,240
and we're getting less infection so this

358
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,799
is something you cannot answer

359
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,799
from the available evidence now

360
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,519
there were statistically significant

361
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:31,759
differences i think it's intriguing but

362
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,560
it is very preliminary i hope it's true

363
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,720
but let's keep this in context

364
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,759
let's suppose it is true

365
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,920
the concentration is very high

366
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,600
and the doses required

367
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
would be very high

368
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,879
um

369
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,159
extrapolating from the studies they did

370
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,838
in rodents

371
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:54,639
um this could be anywhere from

372
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:57,199
113 milligrams of cannabidiol a day up

373
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,839
to 450 milligrams

374
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:02,319
um in the patients

375
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,839
where they're actually describing use

376
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,360
and reduce covid uh incidents

377
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,279
um generally the dosing on that is 15

378
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
milligrams per kilogram per day of

379
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,600
cannabidiol

380
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,559
so in an adult this is going to be

381
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,240
upwards of 1500 milligrams or 2 000

382
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,198
milligrams a day

383
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,159
um

384
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,838
that

385
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,600
even if available is going to be

386
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,839
prohibitively expensive right the

387
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,879
projected average cost per patient of

388
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,320
epidialex in the us is 32 500 a year

389
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,480
and if we're talking about something

390
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,959
that's given as a preventive

391
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,759
not as a treatment at the time

392
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,119
that's an enormous cost that you could

393
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,919
not bear

394
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,320
across the large population i mean that

395
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,240
would absolutely bankrupt the system we

396
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,440
have enough drugs that are bankrupting

397
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,600
the system right now so

398
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,040
again

399
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,320
interesting is what i'd say uh the

400
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:08,399
answer absolutely not and not yet

401
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,278
um so we need a lot more work um to see

402
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,039
if

403
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,879
there's something there

404
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:17,679
um yeah i hope it's true but again um

405
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:21,039
we have to throw some cold water

406
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:23,519
uh on this as uh being anything more

407
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,719
than a little bit intriguing at this

408
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,679
point

409
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,160
right and so this was looking at it um

410
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,120
using cbd as a preventative to have that

411
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,319
right

412
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,600
prima primarily um you know there would

413
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,959
be a role for treatment um they showed

414
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,079
um

415
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,159
that

416
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,198
cannabidiol at least in the animals

417
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,439
could

418
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:51,359
decrease replication

419
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,440
uh and inhibit viral gene expression

420
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,360
uh etc

421
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,800
and um yeah this may be really helpful

422
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
um

423
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,919
again i i hope it's the case

424
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,599
but you know the animal studies they did

425
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:10,159
also were done by doing intraperitoneal

426
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,318
injections so in other words they lift

427
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,319
the skin of the abdomen and inject this

428
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:18,159
and it goes around

429
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:21,519
the gut um so that's a highly vascular

430
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,160
system and it absorbs relatively well

431
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,720
there's a big difference between that

432
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,200
and saying that an oral dose in humans

433
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,440
is going to be absorbed to a sufficient

434
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,840
degree to come anywhere near close to

435
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,798
the tissue concentrations that were

436
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,959
achieved in the animals

437
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,119
similarly in one of the other studies uh

438
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,679
one that's been out longer and gotten a

439
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,639
lot more play this is the van bremen

440
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
study about cannabinoids blocking

441
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,840
entry

442
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,480
obviously in that organ

443
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:55,759
yes it is now they're different it

444
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,839
wasn't cbd it was cannabidiolic acid

445
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,720
cbda and cbga

446
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,798
um uh

447
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,679
now here

448
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,359
the problem is an even greater one

449
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,679
and

450
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,279
you know i i think again this is a very

451
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,480
interesting study

452
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,480
there was good science involved but i

453
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,079
fought this one

454
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,640
the way it was reported i fought that to

455
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,319
lack of adequate peer review now what

456
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,320
does that mean

457
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,279
to be published in a peer-reviewed

458
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:32,079
journal it means it's got to go through

459
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,079
a panel of experts

460
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,720
who critique the article and suggest

461
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:40,798
changes of corrections and i think that

462
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,960
that fell down somewhere along the way

463
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,240
so for example with cbga

464
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,640
cannabidrolic acid

465
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:53,039
um they described an

466
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,320
inhibitory concentration of

467
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,879
[Music]

468
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,879
35 micrograms per milliliter

469
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,639
now

470
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,678
the problem is that's not the way that

471
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,200
we usually report things it's done in

472
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,679
what's termed a tissue concentration

473
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,480
now converting that uh we get a

474
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:20,240
calculation of 97 to 102 micromolar for

475
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,880
cbga micromolar means millionths of a

476
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,960
mole a mole of the molecular weight in

477
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,559
grams per per liter um

478
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,720
so

479
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:34,079
what this means is

480
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,279
that a tremendous concentration

481
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:41,439
uh is needed generally anything above 10

482
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:43,519
micromolar is considered non-druggable

483
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,519
non-druggable is a

484
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,720
term of the industry meaning whether you

485
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,160
can turn it into a pharmaceutical or not

486
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,400
and

487
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,200
people who have experience in this area

488
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,559
will tell you that i think it's totally

489
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,880
impractical

490
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,200
that you could create these kinds of

491
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,960
tissue concentrations

492
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,600
by giving this orally to someone

493
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,600
it's true that the cannabinoid acids

494
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,719
have sometimes been shown to have a

495
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,119
greater bioavailability ability to get

496
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,759
absorbed and into the body

497
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,158
than the neutral cannabinoids but i

498
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,558
don't think this is achievable

499
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,080
again it's possible you could do this on

500
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,279
a surface

501
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,240
um like spraying it on the virus

502
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,079
but

503
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,919
you know to be fear

504
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,439
you can spray 70

505
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,159
ethanol

506
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,000
or rubbing alcohol in that concentration

507
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,720
on the virus and you'll kill it because

508
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,359
it's what's called an envelope virus

509
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,558
if you knock out the envelope the virus

510
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,359
can't work

511
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:47,639
um

512
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,959
you know and this has led to the kind of

513
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,159
misconceptions like with president trump

514
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,000
um at the time recommending uh people

515
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,640
ingest bleach uh to kill the virus no no

516
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,960
no no not quite you do not understand

517
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,080
the science um

518
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,840
so

519
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,918
um

520
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,678
in the article and this this is again

521
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,080
where i fought the

522
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,240
what i think is a lack of

523
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,319
peer review

524
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,400
they felt that these kinds of

525
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,960
concentrations would be clinically

526
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,798
achievable i dissent

527
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,279
um

528
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,200
yeah and again i've talked to many of my

529
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,519
colleagues about this and we're in

530
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,400
agreement that this is just uh not

531
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,240
practical at all

532
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,038
so it's not even the fact that it would

533
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,079
be cost prohibitive it's just that it's

534
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,158
just not achievable is that right that

535
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,279
that's what i believe and again not what

536
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,200
i'd like i'd love for this to be true

537
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,158
now there could be an a's in the hole

538
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,360
here

539
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,280
they got a good response with both cbda

540
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,719
and cbga

541
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,720
what happens with the two of them

542
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,120
together they didn't test that if there

543
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
were some kind of synergy a boosting of

544
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,558
effect

545
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,640
of the two together which often we see

546
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,480
with botanical mixtures

547
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,038
maybe they could get it into a range

548
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,960
where it's more meaningful but right now

549
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,720
it's not even close

550
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,759
um you know again um

551
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,640
numbers that high you just don't see

552
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,240
in

553
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,038
a drug that goes to market it just

554
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,279
doesn't happen

555
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:32,319
and so so we know that cannabinoids are

556
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,000
um or phytocannabinoids are plant

557
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,678
compounds that mimic our

558
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,839
endocannabinoids that our body makes

559
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,519
ourselves so

560
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,119
is there some takeaway here or some

561
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,359
application here where

562
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,678
you know there's something to boost our

563
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:48,879
our own endocannabinoid production that

564
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,280
can help you know prevent an infection

565
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,000
right all right well let's take a little

566
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,678
bit of leap of faith here

567
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
let's say that

568
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,880
there's some signal here that indicates

569
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,200
that cannabidiol can influence the

570
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,400
cytokine storms

571
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,440
and

572
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,640
could reduce damage associated with the

573
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,720
virus

574
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,200
well you know that that's really

575
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,000
possible again i don't think that that's

576
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,759
been demonstrated uh this would require

577
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,319
clinical trials

578
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,200
but one of the things that

579
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,158
um

580
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,279
overall the endocannabinoid system is a

581
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,760
homeostatic regulator or physiology in

582
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,319
other words it keeps things in balance

583
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,038
if a system is overactive it brings it

584
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,119
down into the normal range if it's under

585
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,679
active it brings it up into the normal

586
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,558
range so a lot of this has to do with

587
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,400
protective influences

588
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,038
and

589
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,440
one of the things that cbd does

590
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:54,158
is inhibit the breakdown of anandamide

591
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,519
one of the endogenous cannabinoids and

592
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,919
so over time cannabidiol may well

593
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,599
increase the gain of the endocannabinoid

594
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,600
system and offer

595
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,480
protective effects

596
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,158
particularly against these sort of

597
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,919
immunological battles

598
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,000
that people go through after a severe

599
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,679
covet infection

600
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,720
so that's that's a maybe

601
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,798
and again the last thing i would want is

602
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,079
to say that none of this has any

603
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:28,000
application

604
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:31,038
or future viability i just think that a

605
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,079
lot more research needs to be done

606
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:36,079
and i would point out that um yeah it's

607
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,639
really possible that compounds from

608
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,639
cannabis or other natural products

609
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,919
are going to turn out to be part of the

610
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,720
answer here

611
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,720
um but it is all

612
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,600
too soon

613
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,000
right

614
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,278
right and i know sort of just talking

615
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,759
about

616
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,679
cannabis as as regulating your body's

617
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,798
homeostasis and one of the things is

618
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,278
that

619
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,440
depending on the patient's situation

620
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,880
that cannabis can be an immune booster

621
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,640
or it can be an immune reducer

622
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,320
and one of the the pre-print studies

623
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
that came out just this month was

624
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,480
talking about cbd

625
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,639
being used to potentially

626
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,679
prime components of the innate immune

627
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,080
system increasing readiness to respond

628
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,960
to viral infection so

629
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,759
um

630
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,798
is there some potential there as well

631
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,558
uh perhaps um you know i'd say this

632
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,440
about preprints

633
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,200
uh

634
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,480
first i'm again it

635
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,080
um you know the in the past

636
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,000
you

637
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,199
had to submit your

638
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,038
article for review in a journal it went

639
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,558
through peer review and then hopefully

640
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,759
was published

641
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,240
now

642
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,079
there has developed this tendency to put

643
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,000
things online

644
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,678
and they get a lot of press coverage

645
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,200
before they've been through peer review

646
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,320
at all

647
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,519
sometimes they never even make it um

648
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,519
so

649
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,798
i think

650
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,079
it is a situation that does fraught with

651
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:07,278
pitfalls

652
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,359
um

653
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,119
you know an earlier study in relation to

654
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,119
cbd

655
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,879
and

656
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:19,199
sars cov2 was a kovalchuk study

657
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,320
on this was the idea that

658
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,600
cbd was going to interfere with

659
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,879
binding

660
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,359
to the

661
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,919
spike protein of covid

662
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,759
that where it binds

663
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,520
to the ace2

664
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,400
receptor

665
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,240
the problem with that study was that

666
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,038
they looked at different cannabis

667
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,839
extracts different levels of cbd

668
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:46,079
and there was no dose response effect in

669
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,240
other words some worked better than

670
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,038
others but it really didn't relate to

671
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,839
the concentration of cbd

672
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,519
um and um

673
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,678
you know again there might be something

674
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,359
there but it equally could be the case

675
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,120
that it was another component of the

676
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,719
extracts that was really uh responsible

677
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,839
um so

678
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,240
again it

679
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,879
really it is absolutely essential that

680
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,079
people look at this very skeptically

681
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,640
with a proverbial jaundiced eye

682
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:21,839
to try and find out what the bottom line

683
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,840
truth of the matter is

684
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,480
yeah and that's a great point you make

685
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,759
about pre-prints right is that

686
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,519
as you said they haven't gone through

687
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,960
peer review they haven't gone to the

688
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,319
same scrutiny as something that's

689
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,000
published in a in a true journal and i

690
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,119
think that's some a good thing to keep

691
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,038
in mind as people are looking into this

692
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,719
yeah absolutely i mean i've taken a

693
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,759
stand that i wouldn't uh do preprints on

694
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,839
on

695
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,679
research that we've done even when we

696
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,278
think it's really exciting and we'd like

697
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,320
to get the word out

698
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:53,599
um

699
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,398
but it's

700
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,798
the internet age and um

701
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,479
again what i really don't like is that

702
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,398
these things get publicized and

703
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,480
misinterpreted

704
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:08,319
because of this exposure without the

705
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,240
proper degree of initial scrutiny

706
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:13,119
right it is a double-edged sword though

707
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,798
right because this being an ongoing

708
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,798
pandemic and

709
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,519
there's really a

710
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,000
need for information so that people can

711
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,679
um can act appropriately that waiting

712
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,839
for to go through the full peer review

713
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,240
process might not be prudent

714
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,240
always

715
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,240
perhaps however

716
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,278
it is our best defense against uh junk

717
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,759
science

718
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,839
that's true that's true it's yeah it's a

719
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,119
it's a difficult spot

720
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,798
so

721
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,359
as we're sort of getting to the end here

722
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,038
i did want to sort of bring up the

723
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,879
the question of

724
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,599
is there a potential that cannabis use

725
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,360
could actually be detrimental to

726
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,879
someone's experience with kovi could

727
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:59,519
actually you know as we said

728
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,080
cannabis can regulate your immune system

729
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,119
in either way could it be that cannabis

730
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,000
could

731
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,439
actually reduce your immune response and

732
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,798
make you more vulnerable to covet

733
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
infection

734
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,079
uh maybe i mean the main danger would

735
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,159
relate to smoking and

736
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:18,480
the

737
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,120
damage to the lung tissue

738
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,319
it is simply inarguable

739
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,199
um the issue of whether smoking's good

740
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,798
for the

741
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,399
lungs

742
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,200
it's true that

743
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,839
smoking cannabis does not lead to lung

744
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,960
cancer epidemiologically

745
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,678
however

746
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,880
it is absolutely clear that it does lead

747
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,559
to irritation cough and phlegm

748
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,200
greater susceptibility to upper

749
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:48,480
respiratory infections and

750
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,399
perhaps even a greater susceptibility

751
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,599
to covid

752
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,918
however

753
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:57,918
this would not relate to

754
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:59,120
immunological damage um

755
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,440
the

756
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:05,678
dosing of thc for example that immune is

757
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,720
immunosuppressant is very high

758
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,200
previously estimated at 50 to 100 times

759
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,880
the psychoactive dose

760
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,880
so yes

761
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,278
various cannabis components can be

762
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,520
immunomodulatory

763
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:24,398
but you know cb2 activity may be helpful

764
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:27,918
you know it's again it depends on what's

765
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,199
in it and how it's administered smoking

766
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,200
not good

767
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,960
for the lungs and certainly would be

768
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,919
something to avoid at this juncture

769
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,720
less of an issue with vaporization

770
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,360
obviously oral administration is going

771
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,399
to be safer with any kind of of lung

772
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,278
issue

773
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,319
um

774
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:52,079
so on the one hand yeah um people should

775
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:54,558
avoid smoking um in general

776
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,558
anything

777
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,038
and

778
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,000
but beyond that it's unlikely that use

779
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,558
of

780
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,880
cannabis-based medicines is going to

781
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:08,240
cause harm in this instance

782
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,120
bigger question is can it uh help in any

783
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,640
respect and the answer right now is

784
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,398
maybe but it's got to be proven

785
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,799
right and you know when you mentioned

786
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,798
that the the amount of thc to kind of be

787
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,398
immunosuppressive is is really high it

788
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,158
seems like this is sort of a common

789
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,278
refrain throughout the conversation here

790
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,880
is that the dose is really

791
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:33,119
what might be the limiting factor here

792
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,799
absolutely

793
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,558
absolutely

794
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,879
okay

795
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,960
i think i think we covered most of the

796
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,120
studies that uh that i had pulled out

797
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,679
for us to discuss is there anything that

798
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:49,119
that you had that that we missed

799
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,000
well no i mean i just advise people to

800
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,839
um

801
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,839
you know if you read something about one

802
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,158
of these studies and aren't sure try to

803
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,599
talk to somebody that might be a little

804
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,760
more familiar

805
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,558
um be skeptical

806
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,119
and

807
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,599
good advice would be wait until

808
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:08,158
um higher authorities

809
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,158
um say what seems to be helpful and

810
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,278
what's not and that's a moving target

811
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,559
we've got a situation now

812
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:19,119
with uh some of the antibody treatments

813
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,158
uh that used to help don't work on

814
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:25,038
omicron um but there's one left that

815
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,240
does and now there's some oral agents

816
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:30,158
that work

817
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,880
um you know keep up with what the cdc

818
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,039
and fda might be saying now not what

819
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,799
they were saying three months ago

820
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,480
because everything is in a state of flux

821
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:41,440
yeah absolutely it's always changing and

822
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,519
it's funny you said that about the

823
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,960
monoclonal antibodies because that just

824
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,278
the alert just came up on my phone

825
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,240
before i came in here to talk to you so

826
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,079
um

827
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,159
yeah it's ever-changing

828
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,759
you bet

829
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,440
all right ethan well thanks again for

830
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,038
coming on and talking with us i'm going

831
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,399
to put links to all these studies in the

832
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,798
notes so people can read up on it is um

833
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:05,199
i guess one final thing if you want to

834
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,798
share any websites or social media or

835
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,360
ways people can keep up with the work

836
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:12,000
that you're doing please plug away

837
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:16,038
okay well uh you know our our company is

838
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,759
credo science and that's credo

839
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:19,278
c-r-e-d-o-science.com you can see what

840
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:23,839
we're up to there

841
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:26,558
um on the news front we just last week

842
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:28,398
released a

843
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,278
diagnostic screening test for

844
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:33,839
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

845
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:36,398
information on that can be found on what

846
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,480
is chs that's what

847

chs.com

849
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,158
on there's a lot of useful information

00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:48,720
and links there

851
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,120
absolutely yeah that's great we've had

852
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,600
alice moon on the podcast before talking

853
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,518
about cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

854
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,199
so it's great that we're

855
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,960
we're getting to a point where we can

856
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,880
and start

857
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,360
determining what's what's causing that

858
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,919
because that seems to be quite the issue

859
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,319
well we think we have an answer in

860
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,639
genetic susceptibility basically we

861
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,119
showed five genes

862
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,800
that were statistically significantly

863
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,480
different in chs patients as compared to

864
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,919
patients who used high amounts of

865
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,079
cannabis but didn't have chs

866
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,799
so we believe that

867
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,960
there are some underlying

868
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,320
susceptibilities and this is again

869
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,679
worth exploring further

870
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,320
absolutely

871
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,760
all right well thanks again ethan and i

872
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,440

873

874
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,000

875
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:48,599
