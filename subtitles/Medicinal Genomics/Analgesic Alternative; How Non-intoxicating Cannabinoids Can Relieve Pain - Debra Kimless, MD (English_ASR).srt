1
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:14,058
good afternoon and thank you for the

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:16,099
mckernon family and the organizers for

3
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:18,500
providing this amazing opportunity to

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:21,679
present today and thank you all for

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,359
listening so my name is Deb Kim Ellis

6
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,699
I'm the medical director of forward grow

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,949
a cultivation and processing company in

8
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,589
Maryland and I'm also a medical adviser

9
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:33,409
for pure green and manufacturer of the

10
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:35,899
tablets I'm about to talk about and I

11
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:38,149
usually talk about nutrition microbiome

12
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,179
and ruining everybody's lunch but today

13
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:43,310
I'm going to talk about pain so I'm an

14
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:45,979
anesthesiologist by Board Certification

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,890
and the fact that there are over 110

16
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:51,859
million people in our country suffering

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:55,600
with chronic pain is troublesome

18
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:57,738
that's a third of our population and

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,079
people are also suffering with

20
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:02,689
comorbidities associated with chronic

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,759
pain including insomnia anxiety and

22
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:08,359
depression which of course leads to more

23
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:12,950
pain and the interesting thing about

24
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:14,569
this is that even though 110 million

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,539
people are a lot of people

26
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:20,118
Big Pharma has really not come up with a

27
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:22,670
novel pain medicine since the

28
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:25,819
development of Nappers naproxen sodium

29
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,819
and that was in the 1970s yes there's

30
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:31,639
modifications of this molecule but there

31
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:33,850
really has been no new pharmacologic

32
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:39,019
medication that's safely and reliably

33
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:42,228
addressing painful conditions and so in

34
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:44,449
this month's Consumer Reports hardly a

35
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:47,299
medical journal they tried to summarize

36
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,639
specific pain relieving target options

37
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:53,450
which they broke down into four

38
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:58,248
categories acetaminophen NSAIDs opioids

39
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,629
and muscle relaxers and interesting you

40
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:01,789
know consumers is not a medical journal

41
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:04,699
they they neglected to mention that

42
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,709
there are some fda-approved medicines

43
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,530
for painful conditions so for

44
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:12,110
fibromyalgia pregabalin duloxetine and

45
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,169
Milne a sopran and for neuropathic pain

46
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,480
pregabalin and duloxetine however the

47
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:18,579
rates and successes of this pain

48
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,209
relieving medic

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:25,000
Chin's are variable at best and that

50
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,510
pretty much everything else we prescribe

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,939
for pain relief are off-label uses and

52
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:32,919
what does that mean the anti-epileptics

53
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:35,729
and the antidepressants that we write

54
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:38,379
for have are associated with no

55
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:40,269
double-blind randomized trials

56
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:42,939
supporting their use nor they

57
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,810
fda-approved for the indication of pain

58
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:48,520
but we still prescribe them and in fact

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,039
one out of every five prescriptions that

60
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:56,140
we prescribe as physicians are for

61
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:58,599
off-label use fun fact and commensurate

62
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:00,309
with the fda-approved medications as

63
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,959
well as the off-label there's a whole

64
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:12,250
host of side effects and for some reason

65
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:14,020
they're never good thank you and we

66
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,639
should never underestimate the fact that

67
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,760
patients who take over-the-counter

68
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:22,439
medicines actually believe that they're

69
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:25,599
safe and have either minimal or zero

70
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,340
risk which is why of course they believe

71
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,959
it's over the counter and not

72
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:34,150
prescription however I read a recent

73
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,009
study that said that there's 50 to 80

74
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,700
percent of patients do not take their

75
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:41,919
medications as prescribed and this is

76
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:44,889
for prescriptions not over-the-counter

77
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,869
stuff and so I can I can almost

78
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,389
guarantee that nobody reads a label as

79
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,209
evidenced by who here only takes one

80
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:54,849
ibuprofen for a headache ever right

81
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,500
however there are risks and so we all

82
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:00,459
are aware of the risk of liver failure

83
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:04,560
commencement with an overdose of Tylenol

84
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:07,090
and NSAIDs causing cardiac dysrhythmias

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,009
including ibuprofen because most people

86
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:15,189
take it in prescription doses as well as

87
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:16,539
the risk of NSAIDs even as taken as

88
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,600
directed on the label of which of course

89
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:24,310
no one does associated with an increase

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,100
in myocardial infarction and now the NIH

91
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,500
has come out with the overdose death

92
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,530
rates from all prescription medicines

93
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:36,879
and they continue to increase

94
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:39,069
and then when you take out opiates again

95
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,339
they continue to increase over the years

96
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:44,560
and these increases in opioid related

97
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:47,439
deaths is in spite of our country's

98
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,139
leadership declaring that opioid crisis

99
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,610
as a public health emergency so I don't

100
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,819
think that declaration is really doing

101
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:58,180
much because as the CDC has written that

102
00:04:54,819 --> 00:05:00,849
every day more than a thousand people go

103
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,579
to the emergency room for not using

104
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,590
prescription opioids as directed and so

105
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,969
if we do some math which I'm not a fan

106
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:10,629
of but if we do anyway

107
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,820
the average visit costs about $1,900

108
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:15,399
across the country which means that

109
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:19,120
we're spending 2 million dollars a day

110
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:21,579
for this indication only and yet a

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:27,160
hundred and fifteen people die each day

112
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:28,750
from opioid overdose and interestingly I

113
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,689
call this under the category of

114
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,550
unintended consequence beyond all of the

115
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:35,949
other reasons why there's a rise in

116
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:39,069
opiate addiction and overdose I found

117
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:41,889
this in JAMA surgery that basically said

118
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:44,469
that when they rescheduled hydrocodone

119
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,689
to a schedule two physicians were

120
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,310
writing for more not less pain pills and

121
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:50,949
so with the exception of bariatric

122
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,228
surgery for every other surgery there

123
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:55,509
was a statistically significant increase

124
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,680
in pill writing and the reason was

125
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:58,240
because they couldn't call in

126
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,939
hydrocodone and they didn't want

127
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,430
patients to have to go to an ER or have

128
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:06,459
to go back to the office to get pain

129
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,139
relief or also to make them so that they

130
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:10,019
don't look bad because they don't want

131
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,870
to look like they didn't know what to do

132
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:16,899
so back again to Consumer Reports in

133
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,639
that magazine they said that they're

134
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:20,918
addressing the possibility of cannabis

135
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,740
as a novel medication for pain relief as

136
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:27,129
the medical community we should be

137
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:31,240
ashamed that that consumer reports

138
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:33,040
actually addresses us first and so I was

139
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,079
troubled as we all are about the opioid

140
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,939
crisis as well as needing solutions for

141
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,759
patients who may or may not have access

142
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:42,370
to every iteration of cannabis medicine

143
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,529
due to their geography and so I figured

144
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,120
what is it that we can do that is needed

145
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:49,479
so we need something that's a

146
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,579
give reliable and safe something that's

147
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,729
easy to use to improve compliance so

148
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:56,198
people take it as directed a reliable

149
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:58,209
composition so everybody feels

150
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,540
comfortable taking it something that can

151
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:03,849
be titratable non-intoxicating because

152
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,889
most patients don't want to be sidelined

153
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,570
by their pain but they also don't want

154
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,329
to be sidelined by their pain medicine

155
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:13,719
and ideally something that's affordable

156
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:15,159
and so I was given the opportunity to

157
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,970
create a novel pain reliever so I

158
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,260
formulated this CBD at five milligrams

159
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,910
palmitate ethanol um I'd which from now

160
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,199
on will be called peña because that's

161
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,100
too difficult to pronounce

162
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,560
and then terpenes four iterations which

163
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,450
are going to in a sec total of 0.1

164
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,740
milligram in a rapidly dissolvable

165
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:37,449
sublingual tablet and so why PA well I

166
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,478
believe in the entourage effect and as

167
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:43,389
an anesthesiologist we use medicine

168
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,339
synergistically we administer a little

169
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,810
bit of many drugs to try to enhance the

170
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,899
positive effects and minimize adverse

171
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,418
effects and at a can med conference in

172
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:54,969
Boston a couple years ago doctor

173
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:58,599
Michonne showed a slide of molecules

174
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,970
that he called endocannabinoid like he

175
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,250
said they were naturally occurring that

176
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,770
they are a bioactive and he wondered why

177
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,720
no one was studying them so I quickly

178
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:10,240
wrote them down in a notebook because

179
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,450
I'm a bit of a geek and I began my

180
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,870
research and what I found was with peña

181
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:18,819
an endocannabinoid like molecule really

182
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,168
isn't something new it was new to me but

183
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:22,478
it wasn't new always discovered the

184
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:25,168
1950s and actually has been used for

185
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:28,120
pain relief by itself albeit at higher

186
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:30,609
concentrations and for those of you that

187
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,219
don't know PA is a fatty acid amide like

188
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:36,278
it's endocannabinoid relatives has a

189
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,979
complex multimodal mechanism of action

190
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:40,979
it activates intracellular nuclear and

191
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,778
membrane-associated receptors and

192
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,209
regulates many physiologic functions

193
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:49,330
related to the inflammatory cascade and

194
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:52,119
chronic pain states so for example it

195
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:55,990
directly targets people are alpha GP or

196
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,480
55 GP you are 119 it indirectly affects

197
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,210
CB 1 and 2 receptors through enhancing

198
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,590
and and

199
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,470
through the entourage effect by

200
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:06,290
competing with Fah pe a down modulates

201
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,629
math cell activation inhibits release of

202
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:11,299
inflammatory mass L mediators histamine

203
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:15,200
and TNF alpha and mast cells are often

204
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:17,389
found near sensory endings sensory nerve

205
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,520
endings and their degranulation can

206
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,080
enhance the nociceptive signal and the

207
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,389
reason why peripheral mass cells are

208
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,080
considered to be pro-inflammatory and

209
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:29,809
pro nociceptive so this just skims the

210
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,120
surface of PE A's magical and

211
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:33,649
complicated mechanism of action and how

212
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,720
it can play a role in mitigating pain

213
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:39,919
however I found this incredibly

214
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,200
interesting so we combine PE a CBD and

215
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,360
for terpenes beta carefully and humulin

216
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,670
mercian and little all in a rapidly

217
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,649
dissolvable sublingual tablet the goal

218
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:51,049
was to treat mild to moderate pain to

219
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,909
compete with tylenol and ibuprofen

220
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:56,719
I actually didn't believe this was gonna

221
00:09:52,909 --> 00:10:01,669
work i trialed it first on me and then

222
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:06,379
on 16 patients nine females seven males

223
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:08,599
a meaning age 50 3.2 patients had a

224
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:10,070
variety of painful conditions back in

225
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,340
neck P North rightous musculoskeletal

226
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:17,360
neuropathic dysmenorrhea in one person

227
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:19,490
had a hangover during the trial and then

228
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,129
we used the Wong Baker of pain scale for

229
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,169
easy reading and so the average

230
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:26,870
pretreatment pain scale score was five

231
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:29,899
point one three after one tablet the

232
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:33,289
average pain score dropped to two that's

233
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:35,329
more than half in 20 minutes or less the

234
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:37,730
score dropped again to omotte but almost

235
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:41,900
by half to one point two five in another

236
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:44,629
20 minutes and then again to 0.44 after

237
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:47,990
an hour and then two hours dropped to

238
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:52,250
0.25 and this was statistically

239
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,169
significant and this is a graph of the

240
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:58,309
individual pain scale scores for every

241
00:10:54,169 --> 00:11:03,169
patient and this was the average score

242
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:06,289
over two hours and this formulation

243
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:08,360
approximates the onset of traditional

244
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:10,879
mild to moderate pain relievers hours a

245
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,980
little bit faster we didn't officially

246
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,840
check beyond two hours because it

247
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,930
and I really didn't think this was going

248
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,660
to work but we did ask patients to take

249
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:22,849
down notes as to when their pain

250
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,730
returned most documented somewhere

251
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,610
between four and six hours and two

252
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:33,110
people claimed that with a single tablet

253
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:35,269
it lasted 24 hours and so of course we

254
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,769
worry about side effects right so we

255
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:38,809
want to make sure everything is safe a

256
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,269
survey of the literature looked at the

257
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:43,669
side effects of peña and there are no

258
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,939
reports of severe adverse reactions and

259
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:49,579
in fact the rate of adverse events are

260
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:54,770
even less than placebo in a double-blind

261
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:56,810
study and so we're all understanding the

262
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:59,899
favorable safety profile of CBD and

263
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:02,239
right that's why we're here today so now

264
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:05,480
we're actually looking at this with an

265
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,190
expanded study multi-site and if

266
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,899
anybody's out there in a legal state

267
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,770
that wants to participate please see me

268
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:18,470
afterwards and the preliminary results

269
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:20,899
seemed to mirror the prior study and so

270
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:24,820
the medical statement has always been

271
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:28,309
first do no harm but the question is how

272
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,680
so perhaps dr. McCollum Consumer Reports

273
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:34,159
and all of us here today have

274
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:36,139
illuminated a path and I thank you and I

275
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:42,199
really beat the clock it's I'm from

276
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:51,039
Jersey so I speak quickly and if anyone

277
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:51,040
has any questions I'd be great yes sir

278
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:59,958
when use the pain the reason the number

279
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,999
of pain patients the United States do

280
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,669
you know if any of a lot of the states

281
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:07,360
that allow for medical marijuana

282
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:09,860
classify pain as a kind of catch-all

283
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,720
condition and I'm wondering if that

284
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:16,308
affects that statistic I think they do I

285
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,720
actually think they do classify it as a

286
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:19,068
single like pain I don't think they

287
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,990
break it down in neuro Pathak or

288
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:23,269
whatever although I did see Studies at

289
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,299
the majority of the pain conditions the

290
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:31,999
top two or back pain and the second one

291
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:33,799
is neuropathic pain thank you I just

292
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:36,319
wanted to ask if you could suss out the

293
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:39,558
neuropathic pain responses from others

294
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:40,759
other types of pain so we didn't do it

295
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:42,588
we had a couple patients with

296
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,329
neuropathic pain and their pain was

297
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,420
reduced significantly didn't go away

298
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:49,909
completely but theirs was the less steep

299
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:52,429
of the curves but we are going to do

300
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:55,549
that study there's somebody you

301
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:57,739
mentioned for terpenes very quickly

302
00:13:55,549 --> 00:14:00,979
could you please repeat those and then

303
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,680
my second question is is this tablet and

304
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,920
a CBD isolate is it derived from

305
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:09,528
industrial hemp or is it derived from

306
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,289
therapeutic so the four cannabinoids or

307
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:17,838
beta carry awfully no Moline little

308
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:24,769
immersing the CB is CBD is isolated from

309
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:27,860
a cannabis plant so not hemp I'm

310
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:29,720
wondering what if any are previously

311
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,938
known uses of PE a that may have

312
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,949
inspired this at all so pain

313
00:14:33,938 --> 00:14:38,808
predominantly and works in metabolic

314
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:42,919
issues as well but the studies that I

315
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:46,308
researched it's quite the comprehensive

316
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:48,649
but they use PE a lot for for pain

317
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:50,328
mitigation and inflammation and then a

318
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:52,818
follow-up are you guys working on any

319
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:56,419
alternate formulations absolutely thank

320
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:59,719
you thanks for your talk Deb is this

321
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:02,408
available to patients now it is so the

322
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,699
companies out of Michigan and

323
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:06,979
we can talk about that another time but

324
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:12,378
yes absolutely the CBD iteration they

325
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:13,788
ship across state line and is the DEA is

326
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:17,119
that something you can eat is it enough

327
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:19,668
food so pH but we make it and plants

328
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:22,309
make it and people use it as a

329
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:26,088
nutritional supplement and you can eat

330
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:29,088
it and you know take it as pain medicine

331
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:30,979
three minutes so the the study you were

332
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,869
talking about the multi-site study that

333
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:35,149
you're doing yes I might have missed

334
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:38,028
something but is it do you have a

335
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:39,528
control is it randomizers it's just like

336
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:41,778
a single arm study where you're just

337
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:43,908
right now it's a single arm study to for

338
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:47,568
real proof of concept I mean sixteen

339
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:49,009
patients is you know is interesting but

340
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:51,528
doesn't really speak to everything so

341
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:53,119
first step is to to do a proof of

342
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:55,698
concept to expand that one and then

343
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:58,220
ultimately will develop a placebo which

344
00:15:55,698 --> 00:16:01,428
should be pretty easy and then do a

345
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,769
double-blind randomized trial and what

346
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:09,249
is the advantage of deriving your CBD

347
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:15,408
from marijuana rather than hemp without

348
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:19,038
so the advantage is that the company in

349
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:21,769
Michigan has access to a lot of cannabis

350
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:24,229
Drive CBD and so therefore that a lot of

351
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:26,658
people who clapped here probably believe

352
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:28,669
that there are molecules that go along

353
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:31,188
with it that when you do extraction and

354
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:33,168
so from the cannabis plant is a little

355
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:35,778
bit different from the hemp plant if

356
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:40,728
it's a complete isolate CBD is a

357
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:43,099
molecule CBD CBD but thank you for your

358
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:45,709
work thank you have you done the pain

359
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:48,919
test with adjust PA tablets without the

360
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:50,719
CBD to see results I have not but there

361
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:53,749
are lots of studies out there that have

362
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,720
shown it but it's at 300 milligram to

363
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:57,979
1200 milligram a day again this is why I

364
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,269
didn't think it was going to work

365
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:02,629
because it ours is just a hundred

366
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,609
milligrams but I again I'm I thinking

367
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:06,078
about the entourage effect with the CBD

368
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:10,849
in combination with the PA in the

369
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:14,178
terpenes speaking of the entourage

370
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:15,509
effect how many different strains of

371
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:17,880
cannabis are you Carol

372
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:20,490
testing these with I'm sure I said it

373
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,470
again are you using one strain of

374
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,539
cannabis to test this with your

375
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,539
medication or multiple types in it too

376
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:30,000
hominy right so know that they had one

377
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:32,839
purveyor of cannabis and it was one

378
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,339
strand that the extraction was made from

379
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:36,299
good question and good thought I like

380
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:40,429
where you're going with that there's

381
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,430
there's major differences absolutely

382
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,289
anything else great thank you so much

383
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:48,289
for your attention
