this episode we welcome back michael

73
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,199
levinson a criminal and defense attorney

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,920
with 20 years of experience representing

75
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,039
people in all areas of the cannabis

76
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,759
industry including patients cultivators

77
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,759
retailers and health care providers

78
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,079
we catch up on new developments in

79
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,878
cannabis law since last we spoke

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,719
including ryan's law which requires

81
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,518
california hospitals providing

82
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,400
palliative care allow terminally ill

83
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,120
patients use cannabis medicine

84
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,640
we get into the likely reason ryan's law

85
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,799
is restricted to terminally ill patients

86
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,798
as well as what hospitals and providers

87
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,159
will have to do to accommodate this new

88
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
requirement

89
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,079
we also explore the possibility that

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,239
other states will follow california's

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
lead and enact requirements that are

92
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,158
similar to ryan's law

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,920
we also talk about restrictions that

94
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,079
prevent health care providers from

95
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,399
recommending developing and endorsing

96
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,719
cannabis-based therapeutics the

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
likelihood that the more act which is a

98
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,000
federal legalization bill will become

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,920
law

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,639
and finally we talk about what a more

101
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,000
realistic federal legalization path

102
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,679
might look like

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
i guess that last one's a bit of a

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,360
spoiler for michael's thoughts on the

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
moore act

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,879

141
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,879
since last we spoke i believe it was

142
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,879
all the way back and episode 11 of the

143

podcast

144
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,279
yeah and on that episode we talked a lot

145
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,360
about the legal considerations for

146
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,519
medical providers when recommending

147
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,199
medical cannabis which was a lot of

148
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,159
great information i encourage everyone

149
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,919
to to go back and listen to that episode

150
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,439
in the archives but

151
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,159
since then there's there's been a lot of

152
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,439
updates to cannabis law and i wanted to

153
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
bring you back to talk about some of

154
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,399
those one in particular is ryan's law

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,319
which was just recently signed into law

156
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,000
in california

157
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,639
and i was hoping that you could tell us

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,319
a bit about ryan's law who is ryan and

159
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,478
what does this law mean for health care

160
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,080
providers

161
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,439
so ryan

162
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,240
was ryan

163
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,800
was unfortunately ryan bartel who was

164
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
the son of the mayor of santee which is

165
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,000
a town in

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,560
san diego county

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,639
he had stage four cancer

168
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,680
i believe it was pancreatic cancer he

169
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,199
was ill

170
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,918
and in the later stages of his life

171
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,319
was in hospital or

172
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,680
essentially hospice care and he was

173
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,360
being given a whole lot of opioids

174
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,199
and it put him in a position where i

175
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
mean essentially

176
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,520
um

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
he was not

178
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,879
going to live a whole lot longer so they

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,079
were giving him the opioids essentially

180
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,240
to make him

181
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,478
comfortable which is commonly called

182
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,038
palliative care

183
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,639
and uh but it was what it was doing

184
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,240
according to his family was that it was

185
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,160
making him so

186
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,439
basically incoherent and out of it that

187
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,599
they couldn't talk to him they couldn't

188
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,439
relate to him and that was breaking

189
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,598
their hearts basically

190
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,120
it was very difficult situation

191
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,478
they tried to

192
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800
have the

193
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,959
medical facilities that he was in allow

194
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,598
him to use cannabis

195
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,758
uh so that he would be more coherent and

196
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,959
then excuse me perhaps

197
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,479
not suffering as much pain but it would

198
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,918
would not be suffering as much pain but

199
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,800
would be coherent they could relate to

200
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,439
him so he wouldn't be just completely

201
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,000
wasted all the time the answer was no

202
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,399
and eventually he had his family moved

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,639
into a facility in washington state

204
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,319
which did allow it

205
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,559
although i don't know that it was a

206
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,959
matter of legal uh

207
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,559
wrangle wrangling so to speak they just

208
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,759
found a place that would let him do it

209
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,479
okay

210
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,080
and he initially this got started a

211
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,159
couple of years ago

212
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,879
and uh there was some back and forth

213
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:54,240
about how it would be regulated

214
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:57,439
in terms of uh whether it would uh

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,240
require facilities that get medicare

216
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,399
benefits etc to do it whether it would

217
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,839
be voluntary or allow them to do it

218
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,519
require them to do it if they get

219
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,440
certain benefits

220
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,360
and so the governor at the time felt

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,880
that it was kind of too restrictive of

222
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,278
health care facilities that were

223
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,240
otherwise beneficial

224
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,958
um

225
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,919
so it was he didn't sign it

226
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,838
so they

227
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,120
brought it back in essentially the same

228
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,600
form

229
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,000
and uh this time around

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,519
and they sort of made it uh they had to

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,360
write in a uh

232
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,959
provision that basically the major

233
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,360
change was that

234
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,039
office they kind of put in a protection

235
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,600
for facilities

236
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,039
that they cannot be punished essentially

237
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,959
if they allow this they cannot be

238
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,480
restricted from getting state medicaid

239
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,359
and federal medicare and medicaid

240
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,440
benefits which apparently was not

241
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
sufficiently strong in the first version

242
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
of it otherwise it's essentially the

243
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,000
same and it says that healthcare

244
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,560
facilities

245
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
cannot prevent someone from using

246
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,639
cannabis

247
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,278
as palliative care

248
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,000
if they are a terminal patient

249
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,200
okay and terminal is defined as one year

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,559
of life

251
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,320
uh the pr prognosis of of one year of

252
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,479
life essentially from the time that the

253
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,079
prognosis is made

254
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,278
and um

255
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,199
it doesn't allow smoking or vaping so

256
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,078
presumably oils

257
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,278
and inhaling uh like the uh you know

258
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,719
those uh tornado inhalers those appear

259
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,120
to be allowed under the law which is a

260
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,360
very good way of getting cannabis into

261
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,200
your system

262
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,639
without burning it essentially and i

263
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
think the the

264
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,039
even even with vaping

265
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,399
it is essentially considered burning it

266
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,799
and there is

267
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,000
some form of smoke that comes off you

268
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,278
know it's funny in a way and this is a

269
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,879
little bit of an aside but during the

270
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,720
pandemic you know you

271
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,480
i mean at least i have you know you're

272
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
home more even though you're working

273
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,879
sometimes you watch old movies on turner

274
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,159
classic movies it's amazing you see

275
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,559
movies from the

276
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,399
50s and even into the 60s people in the

277
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,000
hospital are smoking they're smoking in

278
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,679
in hospital rooms they're smoking in the

279
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,759
hallways and hospitals

280
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,159
you look at this now and you're like

281
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,120
it's like an entirely different universe

282
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,278
um

283
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,399
but in any event so that this uh

284
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,919
cannabis

285
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,600
uh use must be allowed uh as long as

286
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,719
they follow the rules

287
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,159
um but it's in terms of not smoking not

288
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,320
vaping

289
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,879
they can't be restricted from certain

290
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,278
federal benefits as a result of it

291
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,559
and it's it's essentially what what it

292
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,919
really boils down to is it is

293
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,199
essentially hospice palliative care

294
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,759
for people in

295
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,440
hospice which is essentially end stage

296
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,958
you know the

297
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,320
there's a end-of-life uh uh stage so to

298
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,838
speak

299
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,600
okay so i just want to clarify here so

300
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,480
is it that the law is saying that

301
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,560
hospitals have to allow cannabis use or

302
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
just that they won't be punished if they

303
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,479
allow it

304
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,120
so the question is whether

305
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,039
uh healthcare facilities must allow the

306
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
use of cannabis and the answer to that

307
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,278
is yes

308
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,200
they are prohibited from restricting it

309
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,879
as long as there is certain type of

310
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,399
health care facility

311
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:19,039
and the type of healthcare facility is

312
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,278
most healthcare facilities

313
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,879
that receive any medicare or medicaid

314
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,559
benefits okay so real quick a kind of an

315
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,480
interesting analogy is something called

316
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,958
the emergency medical treatment active

317
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,480
labor act of 1986

318
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,039
that requires

319
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,759
uh what's called stabilizing care for

320
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,399
any hospital or emergency room

321
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,278
that receives medicare or medicaid funds

322
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,078
so it's

323
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,240
that is the um

324
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,078
requirement that they have to pro allow

325
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
this they don't have to provide it but

326
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,199
they have to allow it to be done as long

327
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,360
as those the restrictions

328
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,440
of not allowing smoking

329
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,639
and vaping are allowed are following

330
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
rather

331
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,440
excellent well that's i mean that's

332
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,439
certainly a positive being able to allow

333
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,160
patients to be using this medicine in

334
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
that setting and i'm curious if

335
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,480
hospitals wanted to take it one step

336
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,600
further and allow patients to use

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,759
cannabis

338
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,759
patients who aren't terminally ill are

339
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,360
they able to do that are they allowed to

340
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,039
do that or does that get into a bit of a

341
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,600
gray area they they certainly could if

342
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,759
they wanted i think that that this law

343
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,800
requires them to do it but only for

344
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,559
hospital for palliative care for hospice

345
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,719
patients or terminally ill patients the

346
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,479
answer is yes they could certainly allow

347
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,879
it which presumably was what happened i

348
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,039
mean we're talking about nationwide now

349
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,759
that's what happened when ryan went to

350
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,599
washington state it was allowed

351
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,600
um you will you'll be hard-pressed to

352
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,399
find any facilities that will really do

353
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,159
it though uh they they had

354
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,078
essentially they were actually part of

355
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,120
the lobbying in favor of this law so

356
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,198
that they could say well hey you know

357
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,759
we're forced to we don't have any choice

358
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,278
because they feel that the terrible fear

359
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,198
amongst healthcare providers is that

360
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,759
they're going to lose their fda approval

361
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,919
for dispensing uh prescription

362
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,278
medications if they get involved in this

363
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,278
and that's the other protection that

364
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,320
they have out of this law too

365
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,000
okay so that makes sense so the hospital

366
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,800
doesn't really want to stick their own

367
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,799
neck out there

368
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,319
by the feds

369
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,399
yeah the medical field is very

370
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,839
risk-averse

371
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,440
to say the least

372
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,240
understandably so

373
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,680
um

374
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,519
to your knowledge are there other states

375
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,479
that have similar laws like this on the

376
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,278
books

377
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,039
i'm aware of of two one is maine and the

378
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,519
other is connecticut

379
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,278
and uh they actually kind of beat cali

380
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,039
excuse me california to the punch on

381
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,120
this which is a little unusual because

382
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,120
california usually has so far has been

383
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,799
the leader right before he passed the

384
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,560
first medical marijuana law in 1996

385
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,639
and um

386
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,799
it's a little i think that california

387
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,399
would have had it first probably but it

388
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,399
but because of the quirky way that it

389
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,639
was worded initially and that's why the

390
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,078
governor vetoed it i mean i you know

391
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,399
it's quite clear to me that you know

392
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,399
this and in his veto statement he said

393
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,240
look every part essentially said every

394
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,240
part of me wants to do this this is a

395
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,159
terrible injustice this needs to be

396
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,278
corrected and so they basically

397
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,799
corrected it

398
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,039
excellent yeah

399
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,039
um no and you made a good point there

400
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,278
that california does seem to be the

401
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,519
leader in a lot of these laws and now

402
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,480
that this has been put in place

403
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,078
is it

404
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,839
unreasonable to think that other states

405
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,879
might fall asleep

406
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,480
um no it's not unreasonable um if the

407
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,159
moore act comes in

408
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,839
is passed especially then all states

409
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,360
will i'm not holding out a lot of hope

410
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,279
for that though

411
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,800
uh that's the federal

412
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,600
law that essentially mimics prop 64

413
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,639
in california and essentially

414
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,959
decriminalizes it's the marijuana

415
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,879
opportunity

416
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:53,518
revitalization and expungement act and

417
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,799
it basically stimulates

418
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,879
the cannabis business stay nationwide by

419
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,879
expunging a lot of records

420
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,799
by decriminalizing it

421
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,039
and by you know setting up a tax

422
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,799
structure that sort of makes it

423
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,480
incentivized for people to get involved

424
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,679
in this business the government claims

425
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,039
it's going to get all this money from

426
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,000
taxes

427
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,439
um you know that remains to be seen

428
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,480
um for

429
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,800
i if you i'll tell you why it's i mean

430
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,959
the other big news lately

431
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,879
in california isn't just this hospice

432
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,039
law but the the degree to which the

433
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,720
black market is flourishing

434
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,240
and uh

435
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,040
that has to do with the fact that they

436
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,879
vote frankly have overtaxed cannabis

437
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,799
and so the black and since because it's

438
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,320
been decriminalized which was

439
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,399
certainly on its face a good thing

440
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,720
decriminalized in the

441
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,799
entirely for certain possession amounts

442
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,680
but also reduced to misdemeanor almost

443
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,799
all the offenses relating to growing and

444
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,078
selling cannabis that used to be

445
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,278
felonies so uh basically the penalties

446
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,599
are pretty low and the police don't

447
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,559
really care so there's a lot of

448
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,800
illegal growing and selling going on

449
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,159
and uh you know they take down these you

450
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,038
know you read they're taking down

451
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,480
enormous grow operations and and the law

452
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,160
enforcement is saying look we're getting

453
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,078
we're barely even scratching the surface

454
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,839
of this because we know what's out there

455
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,480
but that's that's another subject for

456
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,678
another day if they think if the federal

457
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,759
authorities think that they're going to

458
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,360
do away with the black market by taxing

459
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,798
cannabis a lot

460
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,359
that if california's any any uh model

461
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,038
the answer to that is no

462
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,439
not not quite

463
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,200
yeah that's that's interesting i hadn't

464
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
thought of that to you know

465
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,160
decriminalizing and reducing the

466
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,120
penalties

467
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,840
um

468
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:40,239
would sort of enable the black market

469
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:43,599
well if you're if you're it enables the

470
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,558
black market because uh it's it's

471
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,199
cheaper

472
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,359
basically to buy it on the black market

473
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,880
and depending on what you're looking for

474
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,038
okay if you're just looking for

475
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,400
basically smokable flour

476
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,919
um

477
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,400
you know particularly if you that

478
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,240
frankly there's another uh fact that's

479
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,480
been reported lately in california which

480
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,919
is that use of cannabis

481
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,000
did not increase when props it has not

482
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,679
increased since the institutionalization

483
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,679
of prop 64.

484
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,360
so in other words it's legal so you

485
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,679
think well gosh no it's legal so many

486
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,359
more people must be doing it right well

487
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,038
actually no

488
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,558
apparently not and

489
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,558
which would imply

490
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,798
that what you really had frankly which

491
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,879
is what probably people in this industry

492
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,839
knew or that is to say people who

493
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,480
studied this new which is that you had a

494
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,639
well about uh eighty percent of the

495
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,558
product is used by about twenty percent

496
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,559
of the users okay

497
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,839
so in other words you have this sort of

498
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,119
relatively small

499
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,199
uh group of

500
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,678
um you know i'm gonna use this term

501
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,440
affectionately but potheads okay there's

502
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,400
just a certain bunch of people just

503
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,080
smoke pot a lot of pie okay that's just

504
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,759
kind of their thing you know and it's

505
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,279
probably quite frankly if you looked at

506
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,599
the liquor industry you'd probably see

507
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,519
about the same thing maybe 20 percent of

508
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,119
the people use about 80 of the product

509
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,519
or just people that are just like

510
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,519
drinkers you know and then there are the

511
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,599
occasional users you know whatever

512
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,960
parties the occasional but there's

513
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,918
drinkers about 20 maybe 20 25

514
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,000
i mean

515
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,240
and so those people were using it pretty

516
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,279
heavily i'm talking about cannabis now

517
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,839
before it was ever legal sure they have

518
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,639
supply lines they know how to get it the

519
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,798
penalties are minimal

520
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,600
you know they don't really need to go to

521
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,279
the to the legal marketplace to buy it

522
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,839
they do it maybe because it's convenient

523
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,678
and it's less risky

524
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,519
which brings to mind several other

525
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,798
issues about why really the medical

526
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,720
marijuana industry should be doing

527
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,440
should be kind of flourishing better in

528
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
a

529
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,480
in a different way

530
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,519
but you didn't ask me to touch on that

531
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,919
subject so i won't but i will okay no i

532
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,160
feel free to i mean we like to try to

533
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,600
well you know

534
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,558
well one of the questions you put to me

535
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,240
was

536
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,558
i think you said whether doctors could

537
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,400
recommend specific products sure the

538
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,279
answer to that is they can recommend

539
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,080
them

540
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:13,200
so they can what i advise my clients to

541
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:15,119
say is that uh you know this particular

542
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,600
product has been beneficial to my

543
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,119
patients my patients have told me this i

544
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,439
have found that my patients have

545
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,519
benefited from this particular product

546
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,558
and they can even say a brand name

547
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,558
what what doctors cannot do is is profit

548
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,359
from at least in california they can

549
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:34,079
have no financial relationship with any

550
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,199
producer or seller of a cannabis product

551
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,199
okay

552
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,679
which is um

553
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,120
kind of wrong it shouldn't be that way i

554
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,640
i the the impetus behind it is perhaps

555
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,158
understandable

556
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,559
which but it's

557
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,720
just wrong because

558
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,319
the idea was well look you know really

559
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,279
what it is is it

560
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,879
it stems from the idea of almost all of

561
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,158
these laws that we're talking about stem

562
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,679
from the idea

563
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,240
really that this is all bad and wrong

564
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,679
but we might allow it in certain

565
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,798
situations so for example take

566
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,200
the hospice law okay well

567
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,038
that was really the way that the medical

568
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,840
cannabis law was pitched initially in

569
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,359
1996 it's called the compassionate use

570
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,199
act okay

571
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,359
and part of the way it was pitched i

572
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,279
remember hearing it on public radio when

573
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,240
it was being debated you know before the

574
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,038
vote

575
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,880
advocates i mean understandably so but

576
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,400
what they were saying was well you know

577
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,880
basically look these are people that

578
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,559
have really serious illnesses cancer

579
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,799
aids

580
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,240
you name it they're on there

581
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,240
quite frankly they're on their way out

582
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,159
anyway do you really care if they get

583
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,440
high for a few months before they pass

584
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,679
away okay and you know there was

585
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,080
that was part of the pitch and so people

586
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,840
were like well no i guess not you know

587
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,798
it seems perfectly fine

588
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,678
now

589
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,480
that certainly that was what was used to

590
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,200
get

591
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,960
prop 215 passed that was not the only

592
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,960
thing but that was a big part of it okay

593
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,798
it was i mean you know come on do you

594
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,159
really care that much about that for end

595
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,519
of life

596
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,840
stories you know

597
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,000
well

598
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,798
um obviously there's way more medic

599
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,599
medical benefit to cannabis okay it also

600
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,200
stems and and uh this i've many my

601
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,678
clients who are doctors and friends and

602
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,640
people at conferences i've spoken to

603
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,038
you know

604
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,240
i've asked the basic question okay of

605
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,400
them is do you think that most doctors

606
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,558
think that the only real medicinal

607
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,720
benefit to cannabis is that it

608
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,399
intoxicates people it gets them kind of

609
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,919
off and therefore they just don't feel

610
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,360
their pain or they don't care about what

611
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,080
they're going through

612
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,079
and

613
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,879
almost universally they say yes that is

614
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,759
what most doctors think right

615
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,679
and that is a shame okay

616
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,759
because that you know it's sort of like

617
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,120
well that and that really i think is the

618
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,158
impetus now behind this hospice care

619
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,839
law

620
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,720
for sure

621
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,678
um the story of ryan bartel and why it

622
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,919
was

623
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,519
why that law was needed is a compelling

624
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,120
story okay and for sure nobody thinks uh

625
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,679
that there's anything wrong with him

626
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:16,639
using it but it shouldn't be i just

627
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,798
think it's not right to just think that

628
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,320
um that's the only benefit that it could

629
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,359
really have okay

630
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,798
um

631
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,279
and and there's way

632
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,038
way more medicinal benefit to it

633
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,119
persuading people gets harder though

634
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,038
when you think i i think when it's it's

635
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,038
sort of sold as well it's just you know

636
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,879
for end of life and

637
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,839
you know certainly because people think

638
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,919
well you know why not okay when there's

639
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,079
way way more to it than that

640
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,440
so getting back to that what getting

641
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,359
back to the

642
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,360
the question of whether doctors can

643
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,798
endorse products

644
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,278
you know

645
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:54,158
when you go to get um

646
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,400
certain surgeries or prosthetics or what

647
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,720
have you you're using doctor named

648
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
techniques and you get a doc you know

649
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,400
you get the

650
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,919
you know uh uh

651
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,400
dr jobe elbow prosthetic you have the

652
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,000
job surgery technique done and he gets

653
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,400
he well he's no longer alive this is the

654
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,519
guy that invented the tommy john surgery

655
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,600
you know

656
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,519
well there's a curl in job clinic and

657
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,599
when they do their surgery you they do

658
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:24,240
the curb the the job technique they do

659
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,839
they have their named prosthetics that

660
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,960
they use and nobody thinks there's

661
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,359
anything wrong with it these are

662
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,360
approved products they're approved

663
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,639
techniques and procedures and they

664
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,639
developed them why shouldn't they get

665
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,480
money for them okay

666
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,278
that's for

667
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,319
for

668
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:42,640
i think obvious but not so good reasons

669
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,038
that is not allowed in the cannabis

670
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,679
business so doctors

671
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:50,319
cannot develop a product that they think

672
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,278
is really beneficial they cannot develop

673
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,278
a either an oil or excuse me a vape

674
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,440
product or what have you that they've

675
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,759
you know clinically developed in their

676
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,000
practice that they think is beneficial

677
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,158
put their name on it and have it sold

678
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,919
they just can't do that and

679
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,000
again obviously

680
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,400
going back to the fact

681
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,558
that that use did not increase when it

682
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,000
was legalized the theory behind why

683
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:14,960
doctors aren't allowed to do that is

684
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,599
because

685
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,200
it goes back to the idea again that this

686
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,879
is bad

687
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,400
and we should only allow it in certain

688
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,360
circumstances

689
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,640
so

690
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,158
doctors

691
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,120
shouldn't be in the business of you know

692
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,278
of benefiting from recommending this

693
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,879
product because after all only a very

694
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,798
few people should really need it

695
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,320
medically anyway

696
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,240
and we're afraid that if more and more

697
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,558
people start using this things are just

698
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,798
going to go haywire okay well the first

699
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,918
thing we found out is they legalized it

700
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:46,798
completely

701
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,200
right

702
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,359
basically i mean it's totally it's not

703
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,960
unlawful to possess it just up to

704
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,558
certain amounts and just

705
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,159
hypertechnically it's never been illegal

706
00:25:54,558 --> 00:26:00,240
to use it okay but uh in california but

707
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,520
um

708
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,400
the point being that it was fully

709
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,639
legalized use did not go up so what

710
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,559
makes you think that doctors uh you know

711
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,080
sort of approving the use of it is gonna

712
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,918
make it go up i mean people that are

713
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,399
going to use it

714
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,440
in in you know too large in large

715
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,798
degrees

716
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,038
aren't going to wait around for a doctor

717
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,839
recommendation for it what doctors need

718
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,359
or what patients need are products from

719
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,000
doctors

720
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,240
uh i think that are recommended that

721
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,839
doctors know are good that doctors have

722
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,839
developed themselves

723
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,439
and that really do achieve the goals

724
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,439
that they're after one of the biggest

725
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,720
problems that a lot of doctors have

726
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,038
particularly when it comes to the more

727
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,240
complicated medicines for child

728
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,879
illnesses

729
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,120
is a consistent supply of the products

730
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,400
that they think are the the best ones

731
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,639
the ones that work the best for the

732
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,798
patients and by the way

733
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,960
the ridiculous prices that have to be

734
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,158
paid for some of these things

735
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,038
um

736
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,720
and that's due to the idea it's really

737
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,359
based on the idea that this should be

738
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,720
scarce okay scarcity drives a price

739
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,959
there should be scarce this should be

740
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,038
highly regulated this should be

741
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,720
you know this is all very dangerous and

742
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,558
should only be allowed in certain

743
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,839
circumstances

744
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,519
and the reality is it's kind of the

745
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,879
other way around it's really not that

746
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,119
dangerous

747
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,559
and uh it's more far more beneficial

748
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,959
than dangerous

749
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,240
and uh it really if it's used

750
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,319
appropriately

751
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,120
i'm talking about oils and and

752
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,119
particularly cannabis oils for chil and

753
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,918
largely for children or people with uh

754
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,199
uh

755
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,559
cancer

756
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,038
those things

757
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,200
um are not dangerous and they're they

758
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,679
are beneficial and there's no reason why

759
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,120
doctors shouldn't a be able to benefit

760
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,480
from having their names on those

761
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:44,158
products as long as they think they're

762
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,960
beneficial and

763
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,278
uh

764
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,240
and b uh they shouldn't be there's no

765
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:49,359
reason they shouldn't be used in

766
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,278
hospitals

767
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,719
now going one of the questions you also

768
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,558
asked me was whether pharmacies

769
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,319
one of the questions you sent me was

770
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,158
that whether pharmacies would stock

771
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,678
these pro hospital pharmacies would

772
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,360
stock these products

773
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,038
that will not happen in california

774
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,158
because they can only be sold through

775
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,919
licensed uh distributors and retailers

776
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,080
cannabis licensed distributors and

777
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,240
retailers and i'm not aware that any

778
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,918
hospital pharmacy has one of those you

779
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,759
have to have a specific license to be a

780
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,480
canvas retailer from the

781
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,278
from the department of cannabis control

782
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,120
and that's it so it would be supplied

783
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,798
by a well

784
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,759
more than likely the way it would work

785
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,200
actually

786
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:30,558
is

787
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,798
if someone's really sick and they're in

788
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,200
the hospital they will have someone

789
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,440
designated as their primary caregiver

790
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,840
who can go to the to the cannabis

791
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,840
dispensary buy it and then bring it to

792
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,199
them and dispense it to them there

793
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:47,199
which is what they do for people when

794
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,000
they're home and very very sick anyway

795
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
okay

796
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,440
but now can the hospital physician

797
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,960
recommend cannabis for their patients i

798
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,919
know they don't they don't technically

799
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,079
prescribe it right they recommend it um

800
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,679
would they be willing or able to do that

801
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,798
as well or do they have to actually seek

802
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,960
out a different doctor to get it for you

803
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,599
well you don't have to be a special

804
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,038
designated cannabis doctor in texas you

805
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,038
actually do

806
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,759
and maybe in some other states but in

807
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,919
california you do not you just have part

808
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,079
of one of the things that prop 64 did

809
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,000
that was passed in 2016

810
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,398
is it said that you a physician who

811
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,398
recommends cannabis has to be now has to

812
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,558
be the attending physician which means

813
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,558
that you have to take responsibility for

814
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,200
their care okay

815
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,480
what that really means is not a whole

816
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200
lot okay

817
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,880
really what what it was was an impetus

818
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,720
um

819
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,399
the impetus for that was that there were

820
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
basically frankly a lot of sort of

821
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,479
fly-by-night doctors that you know pay

822
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,480
me 40 bucks and i'll write you a letter

823
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,960
so you can you know get away with having

824
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,960
cannabis but technically in california

825
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,519
it need the the recommend it can be a

826
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,159
recommendation or approval

827
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,319
okay and the approval part really goes

828
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,320
back to the real basis of the

829
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,119
compassionate use act which was a lot of

830
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,960
people that were already using cannabis

831
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,639
and so they wanted to be able to have a

832
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,720
conversation with their physician and

833
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
say i'm already doing this

834
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,798
do you think it's okay

835
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,200
and all the doctor legally speaking all

836
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:19,278
the doctor had to do was say yes

837
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,440
and then that person was considered a

838
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,679
qualified cannabis patient in california

839
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,759
because they had an approval it need not

840
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,919
have been in writing it still does not

841
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,599
have to be in writing it just has to be

842
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,120
demonstrable

843
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:36,079
uh if need be it was it was put in this

844
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,359
law was passed in 1996 is the defense

845
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,798
never had to be in writing the reason it

846
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,278
was put in writing

847
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,879
when it was was so that

848
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,558
well at the time there really were no

849
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,278
dispensaries but then there was a new

850
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:50,558
law that was passed in 2004

851
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,798
uh that sort of created the idea of

852
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,240
dispensaries and collectives and they

853
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,480
wanted to have something in writing

854
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,480
before they would sell you anything

855
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,919
before that the the idea was that you'd

856
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,679
have something in writing if you ever

857
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,360
got stopped by an officer and you could

858
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,399
show it to the officer

859
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,798
and maybe

860
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,759
you know they'd let you go okay well

861
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:12,000
that didn't pan out so well

862
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,640
but at least gave you some way of

863
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,278
claiming that you already had this and

864
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,600
you could take it to a judge and uh you

865
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,319
know i mean the the the question of you

866
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,639
know lawfully possessing

867
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,038
an ounce of marijuana when you had a

868
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,559
doctor's recommendation was litigated

869
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,798
endlessly until

870
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,720
well into the 2000s when it

871
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,398
need not have been but it was

872
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,399
wow

873
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,959
yeah okay so i did what i did want to go

874
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,959
back a bit to the this whole idea of you

875
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,558
know physicians or medical professionals

876
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,600
having their name or having their own

877
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,000
products

878
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,759
um and i think that your your analogy

879
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,480
was great with the with the prosthetics

880
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,158
and the in the different um procedures

881
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,159
um but what about i mean if i'm gonna

882
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,080
play devil's advocate what about

883
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,679
um pharmaceuticals um

884
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,798
are they are they able to do that as

885
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,480
well or is there some sort of

886
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,480
limitations around that i don't know

887
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,319
that they have their names on them but

888
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,399
they are allowed to endorse them and

889
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,720
they are allowed to uh

890
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,398
uh profit from them

891
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,679
they are a lot that is allowed there's a

892
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,199
website

893
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,399
called i think it's i'm gonna make i'm

894
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,919
gonna double check it right now but i

895
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:23,119
think it's called dollars for docs

896
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,159
yes dollars for docs and it lists out or

897
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,000
is it yeah

898
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,080
dollars for docs

899
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,759
well it used to be dollars for docks

900
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,439
bonnie bonnie goldstein turned me on to

901
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,440
it and i can't

902
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,278
uh if i i just looked it up that doesn't

903
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,600
seem to be right but she knows about it

904
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,640
it's a it's a website that lists how

905
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,319
much money various doctors make

906
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,200
from the pharmaceutical products that

907
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,038
they endorse okay and from the uh

908
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,558
over-the-counter uh

909
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,000
products that they endorse and there are

910
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,278
doctors making

911
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,359
serious you know millions off of this

912
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:59,119
um so pharmaceuticals uh you can doctors

913
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,719
many of them can have

914
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,439
uh they can have investments in the

915
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,000
companies that make them and sell them

916
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,919
they can endorse them they can recommend

917
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,398
them to their patients as long as they

918
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,360
if they recommend it to their patients

919
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,798
um

920
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,558
or prescribed into the patients there

921
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,240
are certain disclosures

922
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,839
that have to be made so you know i have

923
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,759
an investment in this company but i

924
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:20,798
believe it's the right thing for you etc

925
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,599
etc

926
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:26,079
um i mean the entire pharmaceutical you

927
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,319
know selling uh

928
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,519
business right is uh you know that's a

929
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,200
whole that's a subject perhaps for a

930
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,359
whole nother sure yeah and i know

931
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,120
there's anti-kickback and all those

932
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,759
other sorts of

933
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,759
things put in place

934
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,240
well not to mention just uh you know

935
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,519
this is something that i didn't know it

936
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,038
i guess i'd maybe i'd read it but i

937
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,159
didn't know till recently you know they

938
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,480
they hire

939
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,559
super attractive

940
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,759
women to go around to the doctors and

941
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,079
get them

942
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,240
to buy their products and recommend you

943
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,439
know recommend and and prescribe them to

944
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,120
their patients

945
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,320
you know and and and the other no you

946
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,079
know if you're watching

947
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,000
old movies during the pandemic the other

948
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,879
thing you're watching is

949
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,918
endless advertising for pharmaceutical

950
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,838
medications on television okay ask your

951
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,719
doctor for

952
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,719
and i i've asked i have friends who are

953
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,598
doctors and clients and i ask them

954
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,799
do people really do that they say 100

955
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,079
they do it

956
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,359
because that was our under the

957
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,359
impression it would sort of be the other

958
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,039
way around the doctor asks you what's

959
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,559
wrong and then

960
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,918
but apparently i mean obviously they

961
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,320
wouldn't do this advertising if it

962
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,199
wasn't paying off for them big time so

963
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,480
so

964
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,480
you know ask your doctor for this

965
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,000
is uh and many that and there are

966
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,159
doctors that have they're allowed to

967
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,079
have investments in these companies okay

968
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,240
and i'm not i'm not suggesting there's

969
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,320
necessarily anything wrong with that as

970
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,918
long as the disclosures are made and so

971
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,280
on and so forth and if they are approved

972
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,358
medications

973
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,320
uh you know i guess i don't think

974
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,078
there's anything wrong with that now

975
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,559
when it comes to

976
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,359
opioids okay i think there's a

977
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,440
restriction against that and uh they're

978
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,598
not supposed to have any uh direct

979
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,079
interest in opioids because those are

980
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,880
addicting medications okay

981
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,119
um but the way in which those were sold

982
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,880
to physicians and the you know the just

983
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,200
the monumental deceptions that were

984
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,960
undertaken by the pharmaceutical

985
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,239
companies to grow and sell these

986
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,599
products

987
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,679
and the number of people that have been

988
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,480
harmed from it i mean

989
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,719
i mean

990
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,280
i mean it just pales in comparison to

991
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,679
anything that could even ever be done

992
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,240
you could you could uh you know take the

993
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,919
cannabis industry's worst

994
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,439
abuses and they're not even scratching

995
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,960
the surface of what's happened with the

996
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,880
opioid problems

997
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,519
absolutely

998
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,039
and

999
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,759
i think we're hopeful in a lot of ways

1000
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,719
that cannabis can maybe help solve some

1001
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,960
of the damage that the opioid crisis had

1002
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,719
has provided um well right

1003
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,639
talk with several doctors who think that

1004
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,480
there's there's a path for that

1005
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,920
right well that's uh yes that's correct

1006
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,480
to cure to sort of be the stop gap or

1007
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,320
cure uh addiction that was that actually

1008
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,280
was the impetus behind

1009
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,920
ryan's law was to find some a palliative

1010
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,560
care that was approved in hospital

1011
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,960
use that wasn't an opioid one of the

1012
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,799
first clients i had when i started doing

1013
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,639
marijuana cases was a guy that got his

1014
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,119
knee all messed up

1015
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,598
in afghanistan as a soldier

1016
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,000
and he was growing his own plants here

1017
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,559
in california and he got raided and he

1018
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,639
said he said look he said this the

1019
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,838
reason i'm doing this is because the va

1020
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,078
will give me the

1021
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,679
opioids all day long he said but i can't

1022
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,519
do anything when i take that stuff i

1023
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,719
can't work i can't think i can barely

1024
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,400
function

1025
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,759
um it certainly helps my knee from

1026
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,440
feeling better but i just don't want to

1027
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,760
be that way i want to be able to do a

1028
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,480
lot more he said does marijuana

1029
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,280
marijuana probably isn't as good for

1030
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,559
pure pain management probably not quite

1031
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,200
as good as that

1032
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,039
but it takes enough of the edge off

1033
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,799
but i can still function and i'm

1034
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:03,440
thinking to myself sounds like a good

1035
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,440
plan we actually beat that case okay

1036
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,079
based on medicinal use grounds and also

1037
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,078
because the search warrant was fed but

1038
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,119
this guy had just a long story but this

1039
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,440
guy only had like 12 plants okay

1040
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,000
uh but it was enough for his own use uh

1041
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,400
but you know in those days you know

1042
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,239
this is post uh prop

1043
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,480
uh uh 215 and even after what was

1044
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,919
commonly called senate bill 420 total

1045
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,199
misunderstanding thought you were only

1046
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,519
supposed to have

1047
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,358
uh so many plans and they had to be all

1048
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,599
they couldn't be mature and

1049
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,838
all of this ridiculousness

1050
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,599
but all the police had to do was see one

1051
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,358
plant and they could get a search

1052
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,359
warrant raid your property and take

1053
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,639
everything you have

1054
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,279
those days are

1055
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,799
those days are pretty much gone

1056
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,320
well that's good

1057
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,640
well

1058
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,480
let me let me correct that it's good

1059
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,719
except in california you can only grow

1060
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,358
six plants on your own now

1061
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,959
almost almost everywhere so

1062
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,319
it's good and it's not so good then they

1063
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,320
fine you

1064
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,320
hundreds of dollars for each plant over

1065
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,359
six and that's another issue but we'll

1066
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,359
talk about that another time

1067
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,440
so going back to this um ryan's law and

1068
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,200
you know it is limited to terminally ill

1069
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,480
patients which you know we've talked

1070
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,159
about some of the reasons why we think

1071
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,880
that might be the case but

1072
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,559
does the passage of this um sort of

1073
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,640
leave the door open that they might

1074
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,719
expand it to include all hospital

1075
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,679
patients at some point well i think i

1076
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,719
think yes in the same way that you know

1077
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,319
even when props 215 was passed in 1996

1078
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,399
there was a lot of people saying you

1079
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,559
know they would not necessarily say this

1080
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,119
out loud because they were afraid of i

1081
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,679
always i love the phrase from the

1082
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,000
movie i think it was ghostbusters 2

1083
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,279
when uh

1084
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,199
bill murray

1085
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,200
and sigourney weaver are having dinner

1086
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,519
at the tavern on the green in new york

1087
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,439
okay the fanciest restaurant in town and

1088
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,440
then dan aykroyd

1089
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,639
and the other guy i can't think of his

1090
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,320
name they come running in and they're

1091
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,960
talking about the slime and everything's

1092
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,240
going crazy and bill murray says boys

1093
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,079
you're scaring the straights okay well i

1094
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,319
think they were afraid of scaring the

1095
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,680
straights by coming out and just saying

1096
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,000
what they really believed which is look

1097
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,519
this is step one this there were people

1098
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,599
behind the scenes that were saying that

1099
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,239
in 1996 but they didn't want to scare

1100
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,920
the straights so they said okay you know

1101
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,319
this is just for the really sick people

1102
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,519
blah blah blah and then slowly but

1103
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,800
surely it took 20 years 20 years until

1104
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,960
prop 64 passed now prop 64 has a whole

1105
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,000
panoply of problems that can be

1106
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,599
associated with it but it functionally

1107
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,280
decriminalizes the possession of

1108
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,760
marijuana up to certain amounts in

1109
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,320
california which was something that at

1110
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,119
least until 1996

1111
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,359
frankly nobody really thought would ever

1112
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,280
happen it was always talked about it was

1113
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,679
always talked about when i do other

1114
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,240
kinds of presentations i cite

1115
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:01,838
to a an episode of the old tv show

1116
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:04,318
dragnet from 1968

1117
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,799
in which a guy says he's being harassed

1118
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,318
by sergeant friday about possessing

1119
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,359
marijuana

1120
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:14,000
and he says oh in five years when all

1121
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,078
the kids start wearing ties and working

1122
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,679
they're gonna and get into seats of

1123
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,680
power they're gonna legalize this you'll

1124
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,118
be able to walk into a store and buy it

1125
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,239
just like a pack of cigarettes or a

1126
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,160
bottle of liquor 1968 well it took a

1127
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,639
while

1128
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,118
almost 30 years from there just to get

1129
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,400
medical marijuana approved the stigma

1130
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,838
against it is really strong that's that

1131
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,680
when i'm talking about how people think

1132
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,920
it's bad and we should just let it be

1133
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,000
used in certain circumstances

1134
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,960
that's what i'm talking about the stigma

1135
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,079
um

1136
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,639
but

1137
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,560
it's true that in 96 people behind the

1138
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,759
scenes are saying look this is step one

1139
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:51,759
the the

1140
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,800
there were many people that felt

1141
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,920
that that was this was what was going to

1142
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
lead

1143
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,119
to

1144
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,880
some form of full-on legalization and

1145
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,760
selling it in stores and so on and so

1146
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,680
forth that for sure was the case with uh

1147
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,680
senate bill 420 which passed in two-fold

1148
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:10,078
excuse me 2004

1149
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,519
which allowed for collectives and and

1150
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,680
essentially the

1151
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,920
some form of commerce

1152
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,159
as it related to cannabis it was all had

1153
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,480
to be medical and now it's just an

1154
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,639
industry okay now it's perhaps over

1155
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,480
regulated and there's contradictions and

1156
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,598
the laws which is all

1157
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
true

1158
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,359
um

1159
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,400
but but by the way just to

1160
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:32,559
i'm

1161
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,160
talking primarily about california the

1162
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:38,559
one difference between prop 215 which is

1163
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,838
the capacity excuse me compassionate use

1164
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,039
act

1165
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:45,599
and prop 64 the adult use act which is

1166
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:49,199
arguably the sort of period at the end

1167
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:53,119
of the sentence that was started in 1996

1168
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:55,598
is that props 215 cannot be amended by

1169
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,240
the legislature the only way any part of

1170
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,440
it can be changed is by voter initiative

1171
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,199
okay

1172
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,400
because it was a voter initiative that

1173
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,399
said that

1174
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,800
prop 64

1175
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,280
is different prop 64 was a voter

1176
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,400
initiative but specifically allows the

1177
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,240
legislature to amend it so that each

1178
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,079
little part so that it is not

1179
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,318
necessarily part of the california

1180
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,160
constitution and therefore only changed

1181
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,800
by voter initiative

1182
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,879
so what it means is

1183
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,560
the gist of that is and what was being

1184
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,440
said sort of

1185
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,880
frankly you know sought to voce by the

1186
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,400
people that put that

1187
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,480
on the ballot was

1188
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,720
okay we don't like there's some stuff in

1189
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,639
here that we don't really love

1190
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,639
but we can change it through our

1191
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:43,118
legislators we don't have to go through

1192
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,799
this process anymore this is you know

1193
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,119
this was the tectonic we're going to

1194
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,599
move the tectonic plate here

1195
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,599
by making it fully legal there's going

1196
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,039
to be some some earthquakes that are

1197
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,039
going to need to be dealt with down the

1198
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,679
road but those are going to be more

1199
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,318
manageable this tectonic plate needed to

1200
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,279
be moved and i think even that's why

1201
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,199
normal

1202
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,720
which is normally

1203
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,239
you should pardon the pun would not

1204
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:08,318
necessarily go along with that they'd be

1205
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,399
like no this doesn't have

1206
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,559
they really they really debated whether

1207
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,639
they wanted to support

1208
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,599
you know this much restriction this much

1209
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:20,559
restriction in this form of restriction

1210
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,240
but they got so much good out of it and

1211
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,159
they also got the ability to change it

1212
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,838
to the legislature just through straight

1213
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:27,920
lobbying which is you know kind of the

1214
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:29,279
old-fashioned way to change the law

1215
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,000
rather than having to put everything

1216
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,760
back on the ballot have the voters are

1217
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,199
not wouldn't they did a whole bunch of

1218
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,560
surveys and they knew the voters weren't

1219
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:40,000
going to do another one of these this

1220
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:42,719
was going to be it okay so they

1221
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,358
that's that's probably the biggest

1222
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:49,039
sort of uh upside in a sense

1223
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:50,639
of the legacy of prop 64 the full-on

1224
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:51,519
legalization

1225
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:53,440
uh

1226
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,318
so that isn't necessarily answering the

1227
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,318
question you asked me but that's

1228
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,838
no but it brings to you know an

1229
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:01,119
interesting question i mean you talked

1230
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,199
about

1231
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,039
you know back in 1968 where they were

1232
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,039
talking about how you know eventually

1233
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,480
this is going to be

1234
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,000
sold in store

1235
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,079
you know we're slowly getting there i

1236
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,159
mean you still can't go to 7-eleven and

1237
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,400
and buy a pack of marijuana cigarettes

1238
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:19,039
but you know we're slowly getting there

1239
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,039
um but it's state by state so but what

1240
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,440
about federally and you touched on the

1241
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:26,079
more act earlier um i wonder if you

1242
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,679
could talk a bit more about that like

1243
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,079
you know what is that really how does

1244
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,480
that compare to um the laws that have

1245
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,079
been passed in california and

1246
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,719
is it

1247
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,318
does this act really have a shot of of

1248
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:39,759
making it through congress i know that

1249
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:41,440
there's been other bills like this that

1250
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,680
have come up they've gotten out of the

1251
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,000
house but died in the senate is

1252
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,358
well there's a lot more of that or is

1253
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,159
there a reason to get more excited about

1254
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:52,400
this one well here here's here's the the

1255
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,480
what i think is the real uh bottom line

1256
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,519
here okay which is

1257
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,960
um

1258
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,880
you know the

1259
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,519
congress passed what they've called the

1260
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,358
farm act um a few years ago i forget i

1261
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,800
have to say i don't remember exactly the

1262
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,639
year that it went into effect which

1263
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,280
essentially legalized the growing and

1264
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:12,078
selling of hemp okay

1265
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,680
and the the real reason that they that

1266
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,119
republicans went along with this is a

1267
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,039
couple of reasons one of which is a lot

1268
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,160
of them come from hemp growing states

1269
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,119
okay now interestingly enough hemp

1270
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,920
is

1271
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,440
you know frankly not a terribly profit

1272
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,119
the margin on him isn't great okay

1273
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,280
but it's good work and it you know i

1274
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,599
mean it's legitimate industry and it's

1275
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,040
got a lot of support in farm states and

1276
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,160
so it passed

1277
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,960
but the

1278
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:41,598
the real reason it was sort of

1279
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,519
you know sold as being okay is because

1280
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,359
it doesn't get you high it doesn't get

1281
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:47,838
you high if you listen to the radio ads

1282
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:48,480
for all the cbd products it doesn't you

1283
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:50,159
know

1284
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,358
it doesn't get you high it doesn't get

1285
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:55,440
you high people are just afraid

1286
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,358
of what happens

1287
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,480
to people when they smoke marijuana they

1288
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,519
think they're

1289
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,318
the the

1290
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:05,199
it's just the way it is man uh it goes

1291
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,440
back to reefer madness and before that

1292
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,919
there's there is a

1293
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,960
somehow there's something about getting

1294
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,838
drunk

1295
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,800
that's like okay

1296
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:16,000
right and there's something about

1297
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,039
getting high

1298
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,400
that is just too mysterious

1299
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,960
it's too

1300
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,318
i don't know what it's too frankly

1301
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,559
mexican

1302
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,880
it's too much yes i mean it's cultural

1303
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,719
right you know our culture is very much

1304
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,079
based on alcohol

1305
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:35,838
oh well right and and i mean i'm not for

1306
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,119
microseconds suggesting that alcohol

1307
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,199
should be illegal

1308
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,039
but the health problems and driving

1309
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:42,960
problems and societal problems stemming

1310
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,559
from alcohol

1311
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,159
i mean forget it right it's not even

1312
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,559
debatable right

1313
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,039
none almost essentially none of that can

1314
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:54,838
be associated with marijuana but somehow

1315
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:57,679
it's just scarier it's scarier it's what

1316
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:00,480
those people do

1317
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,799
and we you know the average drinker has

1318
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,480
never been able to understand it okay

1319
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,640
they just can't understand like what

1320
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,960
does this really do for you what does it

1321
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:11,118
mean it just makes people so incoherent

1322
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,039
and crazy and capable of anything and

1323
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,880
blah blah blah which of course

1324
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:16,639
just to give you a real quick exam like

1325
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,039
example a big part of my practice is

1326
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,879
domestic violence cases okay

1327
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,318
so usually i'm talking to the potential

1328
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,480
client he's telling me what happened

1329
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:26,079
there was this argument there was this

1330
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,240
and almost always somewhere in there the

1331
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,280
question comes up you know was anybody

1332
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:30,959
drinking

1333
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,400
well yeah you know i had some drinks

1334
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,760
blah blah blah okay

1335
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,119
i can count

1336
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,760
on zero fingers frankly the number of

1337
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,559
times that somebody i know of

1338
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,400
got high on marijuana and committed any

1339
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,920
act of violence let alone assaulting

1340
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,160
their spouse or their girlfriend or

1341
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,039
anybody else okay

1342
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,239
now

1343
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,800
i'm sure there were times when they were

1344
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,039
maybe using marijuana and drinking okay

1345
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,960
that certainly happens okay

1346
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,880
but it it just does not

1347
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,679
affect people in the same way it just

1348
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,920
doesn't okay driving that's another

1349
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:06,799
statistic real quick okay

1350
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,760
there has been as far as anybody can say

1351
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,440
you know

1352
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,960
even since what

1353
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,838
nominally is the legalization of

1354
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,119
marijuana in 1996 there's been no

1355
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,199
increase

1356
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,318
in accidents relating to the use of

1357
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:21,838
medic of cannabis no accident no

1358
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:23,679
increase in con

1359
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,519
arrests and convictions associated with

1360
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,598
driving under the influence of cannabis

1361
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,920
i'm not sitting here endorsing the idea

1362
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,000
of getting stoned and driving a car no

1363
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,639
i'm just saying that

1364
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,880
it's really not that big a deal

1365
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:38,719
no mix it with alcohol then you've got a

1366
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,559
problem mix it with other drugs maybe

1367
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,358
prescription medications or even illegal

1368
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,920
drugs well then you got a problem or but

1369
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,000
alcohol all by itself i mean forget

1370
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,400
about it right it's it's it's just too

1371
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,960
dangerous to do so so

1372
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,880
um you were asking me i i got uh off on

1373
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,358
a tangent and i forgot exactly what the

1374
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,800
the beginning the more the more act oh

1375
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:02,799
the more rounds okay

1376
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,280
now you would you would think you would

1377
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,440
think at a certain level that this would

1378
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,519
be an uh uh the kind of thing that

1379
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,880
republicans would go for in a

1380
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:15,119
microsecond states rights

1381
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,400
uh libertarian

1382
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,440
live and let live in that regard freedom

1383
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,200
but

1384
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,079
they don't okay

1385
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,159
um

1386
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,839
and i think the you'd think that they'd

1387
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:26,960
be on board for it and there are some

1388
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,799
that are kind of like that the more

1389
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,400
libertarian parts of the republican

1390
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,280
party

1391
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,280
democrats i mean which is odd because

1392
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,240
it's like with biden it's like he would

1393
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,800
lose

1394
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,159
no voter no democratic voter if he just

1395
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,519
came out and just said yeah it should be

1396
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:45,118
legal there's not one democratic voter

1397
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:46,800
no interestingly enough however though

1398
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,960
the kennedy family

1399
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,039
uh which you could arguably make the

1400
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,400
case that biden is kind of a

1401
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,000
sort of a

1402
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,400
for lack of a better phrase of poor

1403
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,719
man's teddy kennedy you know what i mean

1404
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,559
uh politically right i mean he's that's

1405
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:02,399
the kind of democrat he is you know the

1406
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,720
kennedy family is strongly opposed to

1407
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,800
the legalization of marijuana up down

1408
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,480
but i think there's there's a money

1409
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,079
issue involved in that they're shilling

1410
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,159
for pharma they're showing for others

1411
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,720
that's my belief

1412
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,399
so so the democrats should just go for

1413
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:17,838
it the reason the republicans don't do

1414
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,200
it is what i think

1415
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:21,838
this is what i think and i'll give you

1416
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:23,519
an example one of the first cases i had

1417
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:24,880
that really involved medical cannabis

1418
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,639
was the guy was

1419
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,240
he was uh somebody else actually set the

1420
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:29,440
case up for me but this guy was on

1421
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:31,118
probation

1422
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,200
and the question was would the judge let

1423
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,838
him use medical cannabis while he was on

1424
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:37,598
probation okay so we brought the doctor

1425
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,599
in and the doctor said that he uses this

1426
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,599
it makes him feel much better improves

1427
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,039
his health blah blah and this is what

1428
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,720
the judge said

1429
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,119
the judge says you know i understand

1430
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:50,159
that using this cannabis makes him feel

1431
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,640
better but i just can't understand why i

1432
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:55,279
should allow him to use it why he should

1433
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:58,159
be allowed to use this medicine

1434
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,200
just because it makes him feel better

1435
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,279
okay

1436
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,799
okay now take a step right right you

1437
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,599
shook your head right you're like wait a

1438
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,160
minute

1439
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,880
medicine makes them feel better let's

1440
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:08,639
see

1441
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,559
is there some other purpose from this

1442
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:13,118
that seems to be the idea that would be

1443
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,440
the yes i think that's part of it

1444
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,960
and and i remember discussing this with

1445
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,000
somebody and they said well basically

1446
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,480
what that is is that's the puritan ideal

1447
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,639
in a that still infuses its way through

1448
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,358
so much of american society which is

1449
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:29,759
you're not supposed to feel better if

1450
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:32,558
you've done something wrong so if you

1451
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,119
did something wrong legally until you've

1452
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,200
you know purged that through out of your

1453
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,838
system through probation

1454
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,000
then you can feel better by using the

1455
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,239
cannabis okay or

1456
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,639
frankly you're not supposed to feel

1457
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:48,719
better unless you earn it somehow okay

1458
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,358
unless you've done something

1459
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:54,000
hard and positive for yourself okay

1460
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:56,000
and that's what and and so

1461
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,199
what really is i think at the heart of

1462
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,519
the opposition this there is the stigma

1463
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,799
which is cultural but a big that is to

1464
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,400
say ethnically cultural right you know

1465
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,599
but it's also

1466
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,838
that there is a certain mentality in

1467
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,720
american life that says that anything

1468
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,880
good that you get okay

1469
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,039
you have to earn you have to do

1470
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,440
something hard to get and it's just

1471
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:23,838
considered too indulgent too

1472
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,400
self-intelligent to be able to grow this

1473
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:29,039
plant light it on fire suck it into your

1474
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,599
lungs and automatically feel better

1475
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,358
what have you done to earn that feeling

1476
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,280
now i don't think they ask the same

1477
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:36,480
question when they hand you the bottle

1478
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
across the

1479
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,960
uh

1480
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,519
the you know at the liquor store i don't

1481
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,280
think there's any question about

1482
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:46,000
that when it comes to you know you're

1483
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,240
watching you know football on television

1484
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,920
which is nothing but a you know just

1485
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,399
portrayed it's just a big party all day

1486
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,200
long let's just have fun okay

1487
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,519
and then the number one product being

1488
00:52:55,199 --> 00:53:00,000
advertised is beer and liquor okay

1489
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:02,000
so that's fun what did you do well it's

1490
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,920
on sunday okay which means you worked

1491
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,599
all week and it's your day off okay

1492
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,960
that's the thing i'm just telling you

1493
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,359
what i've read about this do i agree

1494
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,599
with all this not necessarily okay

1495
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,679
but that is the

1496
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,599
that's the difference okay the idea it

1497
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,239
and it's also

1498
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,599
it it's seen as unpredictable okay so we

1499
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,039
don't really know what people will do

1500
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,680
when they do this

1501
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:25,679
so republicans who

1502
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,000
uh are much more opposed to the more act

1503
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,519
than democrats and in the senate until

1504
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,599
unless they get rid of the filibuster

1505
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,639
which is a whole other kettle of fish

1506
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,200
right

1507
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,039
um it'll probably meet a stonewall

1508
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:40,159
because it'll just be seen as too

1509
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:43,358
indulgent to this two left wing to the

1510
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:46,078
you know and put aside the the the

1511
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:48,799
you know monetary benefits

1512
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,720
um just in not having to enforce the

1513
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,680
laws now if they don't

1514
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,039
they will undoubtedly over tax it

1515
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:56,799
um but

1516
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:59,119
you know the over text liquor here's

1517
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,079
here's a good uh trivia point for you

1518
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,599
okay

1519
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,519
in uh

1520
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,800
during prohibition there were two ways

1521
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,199
to get liquor legally lawfully one

1522
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,519
was from your priest or rabbi for

1523
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:14,159
sacrimonial purposes and the other was

1524
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,400
you could get a prescription for alcohol

1525
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:18,639
uh and you could and

1526
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,280
that is those are

1527
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:23,118
the met the medicinal part of it is what

1528
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,720
led to the you know growth of a couple

1529
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,280
of major uh

1530
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,118
uh drugstore chains

1531
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,640
but it is also

1532
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,240
kind of the same thing with cannabis you

1533
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:33,598
could you can get

1534
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:36,078
during prohibition the only way to get

1535
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,960
it legally starting in 96 was a medical

1536
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,798
recommendation from a doctor but when

1537
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,599
prohibition ended

1538
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:46,159
alcohol prohibition ended alcohol use

1539
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,838
went down okay and the reason was

1540
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,519
because it was harder to get it was

1541
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:51,440
easier to get during prohibition than it

1542
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:53,440
was than it has been since then now that

1543
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,039
may have changed now because

1544
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,679
you know california for example you can

1545
00:54:55,039 --> 00:55:00,159
buy liquor anywhere 711 cvs it doesn't

1546
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:02,000
matter for many many many years and it's

1547
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:04,639
still in many midwestern states which

1548
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,079
still are sort of more puritan you can

1549
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,400
only buy it at st

1550
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,798
excuse me state sanctioned liquor stores

1551
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,280
and they have much more restricted hours

1552
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:15,358
those all go back to you know the you

1553
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,119
know sort of blue laws and the

1554
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,759
restricted yeah so that way here in

1555
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,599
massachusetts you can only buy

1556
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,799
even beer and wine you can only buy it's

1557
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,200
not state

1558
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,798
owned or state managed liquor stores but

1559
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:28,719
you need do need to have a license you

1560
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:31,599
can't get it at the grocery store or

1561
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:34,558
anything like that yeah i mean and

1562
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:36,960
and probably until not that long ago

1563
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:40,240
they were probably closed on sunday

1564
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,240
absolutely yes

1565
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:45,119
but not in um but not in new hampshire

1566
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:47,679
so everyone will drive up to new

1567
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,798
hampshire and get their beer on sundays

1568
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:52,159
well i grew up in minnesota right and

1569
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:54,079
you know that's what everybody did is

1570
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,598
they went into wisconsin to get what

1571
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,798
they needed when when everything was

1572
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,119
restricted

1573
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,880
um it used to be actually i mean this is

1574
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:03,519
really kind of off the subject

1575
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,680
uh it used to be that local football

1576
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,358
game pro football games were blacked out

1577
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,598
okay you couldn't even if they were sold

1578
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,598
out so you had to drive someplace else

1579
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,640
to go watch them if you wanted to i

1580
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,960
don't know if that was true in new

1581
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,480
england okay but within a certain radius

1582
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,280
of the of the stadium you had to go

1583
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,039
somewhere else so the taverns

1584
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,200
right in the on the wisconsin border

1585
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,039
with minnesota were just did a land

1586
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:27,118
office business every sunday because

1587
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,838
we're going to drive there to watch the

1588
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,920
viking games okay yeah

1589
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:33,838
that that ship sailed a long time ago

1590
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,880
now i mean

1591
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,119
right

1592
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,798
so one more question before i let you go

1593
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,798
because i know we have a hard stop here

1594
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:42,159
or yeah do you want to cut it off here

1595
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:43,920
or um

1596
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:46,159
shoot the question at me and you can

1597
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,639
edit later if need be i guess but go

1598
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,879
ahead okay one more question before i

1599
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:53,039
let you go going back to the to the more

1600
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,358
act i think you've you pretty much

1601
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,440
dashed our hopes there which yeah i

1602
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,039
think i think you're right but i'm

1603
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,039
wondering kind of bringing it back to

1604
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:02,558
ryan's law is there

1605
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:04,318
do you think there might be an appetite

1606
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,559
for something that's more

1607
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:07,920
focused together i think betterly i

1608
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,359
think i didn't mean trump i think what

1609
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,798
they're going to do federally is i think

1610
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:12,480
the way that they're really going to do

1611
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:14,480
it because they're going to do it sort

1612
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,159
of piecemeal so the first thing that

1613
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,400
they absolutely have to do and that i

1614
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:21,118
think actually republicans will go along

1615
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,440
with eventually is allow banking to be

1616
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,720
used because that is just

1617
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,200
just the the

1618
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:28,558
the contradiction there is so ridiculous

1619
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,879
the fact that you have this legal

1620
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,798
business but you can't really use a bank

1621
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,240
it just creates way too much trouble and

1622
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:35,759
i think that even republicans are going

1623
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:37,919
to be like okay

1624
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,000
we'll allow that okay

1625
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,159
um and the other thing i think that will

1626
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,679
come would be something like

1627
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,000
it would the way that they would do it

1628
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,199
is they would not restrict medicare

1629
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,559
payments they would not restrict

1630
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:51,118
medicaid payments in other words there

1631
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,280
would be no federal sanction put aside

1632
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,960
criminal law no federal sanction for the

1633
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,319
restriction of certain uses they would

1634
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,559
not they would say that it wouldn't

1635
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:59,358
affect their dea licenses and so on to

1636
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,280
allow

1637
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:03,440
but i think they'll i think they'll do i

1638
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,280
mean if you can't get past the idea of

1639
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,960
palliative care

1640
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,359
in california i don't think you're going

1641
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,559
to get past it with a senator from uh

1642
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:12,159
you know

1643
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,839
mississippi i mean that's the thing

1644
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,719
gonna happen you know what i mean and

1645
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:17,279
and

1646
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:19,759
and that's what i so so i think that yes

1647
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:23,040
and wise legislators

1648
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,760
are working on those things um but and

1649
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:25,920
and

1650
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,119
they'll usually what happens to really

1651
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,880
move the ball on something like this

1652
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,280
there has to be some really publicly

1653
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,880
recognized injustice i mean

1654
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:37,280
the the the injustice of ryan's parents

1655
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,760
is what it took that one sort of very

1656
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,280
identifiable heartbreaking obvious

1657
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,000
injustice there

1658
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,079
is what led to that um sort of you know

1659
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,920
just people complaining so to speak

1660
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,839
without some dramatic

1661
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,760
you know single case or a couple of

1662
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:53,599
single cases usually doesn't get that

1663
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,280
job done

1664
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,280
all right well

1665
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,559
thanks again michael for taking the time
