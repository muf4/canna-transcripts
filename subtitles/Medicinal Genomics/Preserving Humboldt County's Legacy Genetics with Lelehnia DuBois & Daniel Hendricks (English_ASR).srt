culture of the region

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,439
lele grew up in two worlds one was with

120
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,600
her father on the southern california

121
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,600
beaches while the other was with her

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,439
mother in a homestead deep in the heart

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,520
of the emerald triangle

124
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,199
it was with her mother where helele

125
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,599
experienced much of the trauma

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,080
associated with the drug war

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,960
including raids family homelessness

128
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,959
death kidnapping and abuse

129
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,879
that experience was enough to make her

130
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,839
want nothing to do with cannabis as an

131
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,719
adult

132
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,038
but that all changed in 1999 when lele

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,320
sustained a life-changing spinal cord

134
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,560
injury

135
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,719
lele began to implement the alternative

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
healing tools her mother taught her

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,280
after western medicines failed

138
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,918
she now believes the cannabis plant is a

139
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,839
large part of her ability to thrive and

140
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,240
sees it as a vehicle to help create

141
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,758
positive change in her community that

142
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,079
has been oppressed by the drug war

143
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,199
daniel is the ceo and co-founder of

144

producers in california

149
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,918
daniel's journey and passion for

150
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,560
cannabis began at an early age in 1999

151
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,240
in his hometown of arcata humboldt

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,639
flourished

157
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,199
with his own special focus on genetics

158
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,478
and breeding this unique plant aided in

159
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,520
his personal growth and mental health

160
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,599

the valuable cannabis specific knowledge

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,918
that legacy growers have and why they

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,919

168
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,359
researchers and academics to move the

169

195
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,758
good afternoon lele and daniel thanks

196
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,360
for joining us on the podcast

197
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,680
thank you so much ben for having us

198
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,960
absolutely all right so you guys are

199
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,280
both proud humboldt county residents

200
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,959
and i think most people in the industry

201
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,878
are familiar with humboldt or the

202
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,918
emerald triangle or have at least heard

203
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,240
of it but

204
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,079
for those listeners who are not familiar

205
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,478
with humboldt county i was wondering if

206
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,680
you could start by telling us what makes

207
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,680
that area so unique and so iconic in the

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,079
greater cannabis community and maybe

209
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,598
lele you can start

210
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,000
all right um

211
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,240
well i think you know you kind of have

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,279
two people that grew up here in humboldt

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
county

214
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,918
and and in my perspective and and i

215
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
imagine daniel will agree with some of

216
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,758
this is it's really more about our

217
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
culture than the plant

218
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,639
um the culture is what brought the plant

219
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
here and we utilize the plant to support

220
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,000
our culture

221
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,760
and what i think really makes us unique

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,320
is that we did build a culture kind of

223
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,200
different than the rest of the world um

224
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,000
in a lot of ways um that

225
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,759
that evolve around sustainability and

226
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
engaging with nature

227
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,039
you know i was taught to eat with the

228
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,560
seasons

229
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:04,000
um we grew all our own food except for

230
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:06,399
grains and things like that um we i was

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,120
raised off the grid with we built our

232
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,839
own solar power systems our own energy

233
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,000
systems water heater systems

234
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,000
um and it really was to bring

235
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,720
bring the world back to nature you know

236
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,799
some people call it back to the land

237
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,278
the back to the land movement

238
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,639
um you hear the word the off gridders

239
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,320
these days

240
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,559
but these communities and other

241
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,440
communities like it across the world

242
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,039
really utilize cannabis to build that

243
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,120
utopian

244
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,240
lifestyle

245
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,278
and to me that's what sets humble apart

246
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,278
we've managed to stand up against

247
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,080
major timber companies

248
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,200
and change policy around

249
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,519
logging

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,160
we've managed to protect our um

251
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,480
folks from war in one of our towns we

252
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,278
made it so that if you were running away

253
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,680
from the uh

254
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,320
oh what is it called daniel when you're

255
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,799
enlisting that you would be protected in

256
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,000
the city of arcata so we really were

257
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,719
able to take our views of freedom and

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,159
and build them here we're very engaged

259
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,639
with our government

260
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:22,240
which i i really appreciate

261
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:25,120
um and and it's that kind of back to the

262
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,079
land how do we build a better world that

263
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,360
created the culture here

264
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,439
yeah i i couldn't agree more yeah i

265
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,839
think that my answer would reflect the

266
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,959
exact same principles where it's

267
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,399
environmental you know land stewardship

268
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:46,000
is at the core principle you know that

269
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,958
hunting and fishing and farming are all

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
like a

271
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,879
core part of everyone's operational

272
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,720
function that organics and you know

273
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,679
acceptance of

274
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,040
race religion sexual orientation are all

275
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,159
principles that are like baked into the

276
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,120
humboldt

277
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,759
you know

278
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,799
persona you know and it ties to like the

279
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:12,240
kookiness and you know easiness of hey

280
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,479
we accept the plant you know we have

281
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,519
uh except nature we have you know people

282
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,920
like julia butterfly in the 90s living

283
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
in a redwood tree hundreds of feet you

284
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,559
know above the ground through all the

285
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,320
seasons

286
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,159
to show how much

287
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,200
she and the community care about you

288
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,919
know in the environment and it just yeah

289
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,399
it's this weird tapestry of like

290
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:39,039
cannabis and openness and yeah

291
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,360
artistic expression so yeah the culture

292
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,759
is what brings the plant and the people

293
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,000
and and if you ask almost any dinner

294
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,240
party i've ever been to humboldt county

295
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,879
somebody there has passed through

296
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,519
uh and experienced some of it you know

297
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,120
whether it's the tourism um you know

298
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,600
they're here for

299
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,839
education at humboldt state university

300
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,200
or or actually just wanted to see this

301
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,720
mythological place for real uh

302
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,278
yeah

303
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
and it really is mythological

304
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,320
um

305
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,759
i can't i can't remember what year or

306
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,760
when it was but when mount lassen last

307
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:19,278
exploded and it hit

308
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:21,360
the the um ocean it created all these

309
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,078
plates that created all these really

310
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,720
heavy mineral deposits that have a lot

311
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,719
of energy coming out of it and if you

312
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,360
look at it's called the klamath knot is

313
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,480
what is its mystical name

314
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,800
um but it impacts the water the the

315
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,440
environment and all sorts of things

316
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,958
around here that contribute to our

317
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,480
biodiversity

318
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,719
um and it's a very magical geological

319
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,759
anomaly a non although i can't say that

320
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:54,560
right but you know the word i mean

321
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,559
yeah anomaly normally there we go

322
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,480
all right well that's that's really cool

323
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
so

324
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,278
going back to cannabis specifically

325
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
though and you can correct me if i'm

326
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:07,120
wrong but sort of before before there

327
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,039
was really a legal market in california

328
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,879
humboldt county and the emerald triangle

329
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,078
was really sort of the

330
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,360
um

331
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:18,638
the epicenter for cannabis culture in

332
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,639
california fair to say

333
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,349
it felt like it

334
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:23,350
[Laughter]

335
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,360
i i think um where we got

336
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,399
in our history was during you know

337
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,600
during the 80s when camp came in and

338
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,240
where we have a unique experience i mean

339
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,920
there's a lot of cultures that utilize

340
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,320
cannabis in a lot of different ways

341
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,838
throughout history as we're slowly

342
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,278
unfolding right

343
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:50,240
but what i think is a little unique to

344
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,679
to humboldt and the emerald triangle is

345
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,680
how our culture

346
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,078
how we were impacted and how we

347
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,759
navigated the drug war you know we

348
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:02,638
really did have military helicopters

349
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,278
chasing us out of our gardens

350
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,079
and that creates

351
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,879
a lot of trauma but it also creates a

352
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,958
lot of resilience which is what i love

353
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,000
so much about our communities and i

354
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,239
think

355
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,679
is so valuable for the rest of the world

356
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,759
to understand and learn is how we do

357
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,759
build resilience out of hardship

358
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,519
absolutely i think you know humboldt

359
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,759
county has definitely

360
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,879
um it bears the scars of the drug war

361
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,879
for sure

362
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,720
and i think i don't want to speak for

363
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,480
you guys but i think when you know

364
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,800
legalization came through there was a

365
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,120
lot of hope that you know

366
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,919
the the farms and the folks in humboldt

367
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,639
could could prosper from that and really

368
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,399
take advantage and and i'm curious you

369
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,799
know if you could talk about what is the

370
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,639
current state of you know local growing

371
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,559
in humboldt county and

372
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
has it really lived up to the

373
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,719
expectations

374
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,360
of that

375
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,120
i would say that okay

376
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,199
so to make sure you don't answer for us

377
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,320
in that sense that i would say that

378
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,559
there was a lot of

379
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,360
division in their opinion of whether or

380
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,159
not

381
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,839
um the state of california or you know

382
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,439
any government agency was going to come

383
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,920
in there and fix

384
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,000
the medical freedom of growing the plant

385
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,679
um i think there was a lot of doubt that

386
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,360
that would work and that

387
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,278
specifically northern humble and

388
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,360
southern humboldt they were

389
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,519
diametrically opposed it was like

390
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,919
southern humble voted

391
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,560
down the concept of legalization in

392
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,159
california repeatedly and and northern

393
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,599
humble maybe supported it the second

394
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,120
time around but

395
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,040
you know i think there is a lot of doubt

396
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,039
that that that

397
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,198
the taxation and the state of california

398
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:48,159
would come in and and bureaucratically

399
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,879
fix something like the cannabis industry

400
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,719
so

401
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,439
i think that

402
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,160
the people might say that they all saw

403
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,199
this you know coming in the sense that

404
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,559
it invites in big business um and it

405
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,159
invites in

406
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,000
um

407
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,078
well heavy taxation is a problem because

408
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,480
it comes at every single level of

409
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,719
government for for a cannabis business

410
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,199
it's really strict from a federal level

411
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,759
it's really strict from a state level um

412
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,159
you've got any entity in in the state

413
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,879
can can tax you so there's a lot of

414
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,078
levies against it

415
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,958
and so people that want to do it

416
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,078
ecologically sensitive and

417
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,319
you know

418
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,399
make it like the smallest

419
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,440
footprint they can which is you know the

420
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,519
typical humboldt small farm uh they run

421
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,959
against a lot of obstacles

422
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,159
that are just kind of baked into the

423
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,198
system

424
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,679
so i don't think there's a ton of

425
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,519
surprise where we're at um and i think

426
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,599
that like some people are finding

427
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,240
success and some people are saying i

428
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,240
told you so

429
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,919
and i think daniel and i um come from

430
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:59,680
that resilience part of the trauma

431
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:02,078
of knowing that things get really bad

432
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,159
but when you work hard and you persevere

433
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:07,438
they get really good and that just like

434
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,319
nature everything evolves and cycles

435
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,558
um

436
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,119
and change is scary

437
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,678
you know and and it can be really scary

438
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,399
for a lot of people i think we have a

439
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,280
really long way to go before we

440
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,919
are

441
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,160
normalized meaning that we have policies

442
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,880
that actually support a successful and

443
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,000
sustainable industry

444
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,880
but we also have a really huge gap

445
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,960
between folks like daniel and myself and

446
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,720
other folks that have this legacy of

447
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,679
experience and knowledge around the

448
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,558
plant

449
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,400
and new science and technology so all

450
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,399
these mistakes are getting made and

451
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,480
that's part of what we're trying to do

452
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,320
with the with the with the legacy

453
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,120
project in humboldt grace

454
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,519
is how do we get those two conversations

455
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,479
to talk more and connect and support

456
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,879
each other because we know the magic

457
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,519
behind this plant but we haven't broken

458
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,799
it down into all the words and the laugh

459
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:07,200
and we need that help to build

460
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,480
to build a stable industry let alone a

461
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,480
sustainable industry

462
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,519
yeah and i think that's a great point

463
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,279
and that's probably a great segue for

464
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,359
you to talk about the project that you

465
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,798
guys are building out there to address

466
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,959
some of these issues with the industry

467
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,119
so layla i was hoping you could tell us

468
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,160
a bit about the legacy project and what

469
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,319
problems is it really hoping to address

470
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,640
well the humble grace foundation was

471
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,480
really created to help and empower and

472
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,919
inhale these the communities that have

473
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,880
been impacted like we discussed earlier

474
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,720
and you know nature always tells you

475
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,240
that you really have to start at the

476
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,120
core to create any solutions or the seed

477
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,359
and

478
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,199
personally what my experience around

479
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,918
this plant has taught me that if you

480
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,840
don't understand your plant it's really

481
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,280
hard to measure any of the other

482
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,279
variables and we as a community know

483
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,359
that our microclimates are unique

484
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,839
because we have this amazing redwood

485
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,319
curtain and so much diversity we know

486
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,240
that our processes are unique because

487
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,678
we've been working with this plant i

488
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,000
know someone who's been working with

489
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,519
this plant for six generations in this

490
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,519
area they have very unique understanding

491
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,798
and then as daniel and i also told you

492
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,639
the people and the culture are so unique

493
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,200
um and so

494
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,520
the legacy project is a way to start

495
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,720
with that seed with the genetics because

496
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,160
we have

497
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,558
volumes of genetic genetic diversity in

498
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,440
these communities that has not even been

499
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,678
touched for so many reasons one

500
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,360
there's very little understanding that

501
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,798
that's there and there's very little

502
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:47,279
data to show that's there to trust

503
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,119
you know these some of these genetics

504
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,558
are considered you know like the hope

505
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,079
diamond in some cases um

506
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,000
you know people have put a lot of their

507
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,359
lives into it and so how do we bring

508
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,319
those together

509
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,319
and this event and this concept and this

510
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,639
vision was an idea

511
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,200
to not only start bringing those things

512
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,080
out but to empower all those

513
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,159
small farmers that are being so impacted

514
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,960
and they can't get through

515
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,480
to

516
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,360
switch the market let's go small let's

517
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,440
grow right and let's really know how our

518
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,158
genetics are curating in those

519
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,960
microclimates because we know

520
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,640
a lot of us know that when when daniel

521
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,200
grows skunk in his backyard and i grow

522
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,280
skunk in my backyard they can come from

523
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,840
the exact same mama but they're going to

524
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,000
be slightly different medicines and if

525
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,639
we really want to keep healing people

526
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,119
and we really want to utilize this plant

527
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,360
to what it's able to do

528
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,558
then we have to start having the

529
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,599
conversation

530
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,480
around the genetics the processes and

531
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,279
the climates we also know and have seen

532
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,440
already that as the market grows and the

533
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,240
consumer becomes more mature and product

534
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,640
developers come become more mature the

535
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,440
only way to really have that product

536
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,919
efficacy and create that consumer

537
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,279
loyalty that every brand and every

538
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,720
company needs genetics are also a part

539
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,119
of that story

540
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,120
and we want our farmers to be growing

541
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,399
all those special things just like they

542
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,038
used to

543
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,000
not hurting not negatively impacting the

544
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,480
environment and innovating helping you

545
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,880
helping the industry innovate because we

546
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,839
do have generations of knowledge

547
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,840
genetics and processes around this plant

548
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,000
and so the legacy project

549
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:41,119
is a way for all us all of us to come

550
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,079
together and start solving problems but

551
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,839
it's also a way to educate through the

552
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,918
vehicle of an event

553
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,519
um in marketing

554
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,520
why these things are of value

555
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,960
daniel anything to add there

556
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,200
uh yeah you know my my motivation that's

557
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,720
intertwined and all that is you know the

558
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,519
preservation

559
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,600
uh

560
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,359
to me that's the you know one of these

561
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,719
great vehicles that

562
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,759
um

563
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,839
the legacy project offers is

564
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,640
people to come out of the shadows with

565
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:19,119
these genetics you know there's a

566
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,320
40-year head start

567
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:25,678
in creating these local land races and

568
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:28,079
genetics that are critical to genetic

569
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,880
diversity in this like amazing plant

570
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,359
which

571
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,799
you know aids in cancer research and it

572
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:37,918
aids in autism research and it aids in

573
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,599
wellness and self-care in a time where

574
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,480
you know that's a really important

575
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:45,359
factor in how we manage our daily lives

576
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,079
and so the diversity that exists there

577
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,038
if we you know look at any other crop

578
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,439
that's

579
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,359
grown in this kind of fashion genetic

580
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,960
diversity becomes

581
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,279
critical 50 years

582
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,038
into the crop production where you need

583
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,960
some diversity to

584
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,558
fight a pest or a pathogen or um

585
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,000
the stress

586
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:10,480
that the environment is going in incur

587
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,599
over the next 30 years as drought sets

588
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,480
in so

589
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,199
you know diversity is not just like it's

590
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,519
so critical and the legacy project and

591
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
the awareness around

592
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,038
cannabis genetics

593
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,240
is critical and so i looked at humboldt

594
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,240
county as

595
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,480
you know this great wealth of genetics

596
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,558
and and i really hope that every

597
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,599
buddy uh you know

598
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,519
is able to like access this resource

599
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,038
that we all have and you know we've been

600
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:41,038
privileged to for for many decades

601
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:43,519
for sure and you know

602
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,759
the more cultivators or folks who are

603
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,440
studying cannabis genetics

604
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,319
each time i talk to them they talk about

605
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,240
how

606
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,798
a lot of the products we see on the

607
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,960
shelves and dispense dispensaries and

608
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,359
everything the diversity is just not

609
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,759
there it's it's a lot of the same it's

610
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,479
all kind of you know high thc

611
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:05,119
sort of strains and it's all sort of the

612
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,640
same so

613
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,199
i was wondering if you could speak a bit

614
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,440
about some of the diversity that um that

615
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,200
these legacy growers may be sitting on

616
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,759
that um that we might

617
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,759
get to see

618
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,240
yeah it is incredible

619
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,200
uh because you there's

620
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,839
is the trend right now you know if you

621
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,200
make it simple is high thc you know a

622
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,918
certain kind of

623
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,798
terpene profile um

624
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,000
and

625
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,679
you know i don't want to pick on any

626
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,839
strands so i won't name names but you

627
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,798
know the most popular things that move

628
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:41,678
up the leafly chain sometimes um are the

629
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:43,119
very same that like i'm a daily all-day

630
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,159
smoker and i

631
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,759
am not affected much by cannabis

632
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,919
some of them give me a headache and i

633
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,158
know which ones do and i know which ones

634
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,520
don't and i know which ones are going to

635
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,240
keep me up and which ones are going to

636
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,558
help me go down and which ones before i

637
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,839
play basketball and you know which one

638
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,759
before this podcast so i think that

639
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,399
people get you know they're they're

640
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,480
missing out a lot of like the experience

641
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,320
and that's kind of painful to see you

642
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
know it's like well you know if you

643
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,759
reduce everything to a data point then

644
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,600
oh high thc sells faster and you know

645
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,440
purple sells faster

646
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,798
it it really locks you

647
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,400
you're locking yourself out of

648
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,400
experience and

649
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,640
you know cannabis isn't about the visual

650
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,519
and the it's about the whole experience

651
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,559
so

652
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,599
yeah the diversity is amazing and you

653
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,879
know what

654
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:37,759
won the emerald cup this year um

655
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,840
came from um canna country for the

656
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,640
breeders cup and it was

657
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,439
a low thc high fruit

658
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,400
bred by one of the legacy farmers it was

659
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,320
i happen to know cherimoya which is an

660
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,640
old land race which was one of the

661
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,480
influencing genetics in it so

662
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,080
the best of the best and what is

663
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,880
reviewed the best when you have these

664
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,720
competitions is not the highest thc it's

665
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,640
not what's available um in most

666
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,480
dispensaries and so if you want to have

667
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,640
the best experience you're going to have

668
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,400
to be a connoisseur and people just you

669
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,159
know it's going to take time and until

670
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,559
then we just kind of get to enjoy these

671
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,799
privileges firsthand us

672
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:17,200
you know up here in the sticks

673
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,480
i think also when you're talking about

674
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,759
business

675
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,759
is

676
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,079
people are going to want to be able to

677
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,240
get you know have a very particular

678
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,158
experience your brand represents

679
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,720
something right maybe it's a hip-hop

680
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,080
show maybe it's a field of flowers but

681
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,679
consumers are gonna have that

682
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,918
expectation

683
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,919
i like blunts and i and i got a blunt

684
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,360
the other day it i'm not gonna it was

685
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,559
named by a very feminine jeweler company

686
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:47,278
and i bought that blunt and i expected

687
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:50,879
like something that i enjoyed and it was

688
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:54,079
like skunky skunky like or more gassy

689
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,120
probably like a heavy og but they had

690
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,879
named it this very feminine name

691
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,959
you can get away with that right now

692
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,760
because it was really good weed

693
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,159
but

694
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:07,359
in five years from now the consumer is

695
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,200
going to be so much more mature

696
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,599
that you're not going to be able to get

697
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,640
away with that and so brands and product

698
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,439
makers

699
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,440
we see them calling us calling our

700
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,240
communities and saying

701
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,960
hey i really want this experience and

702
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,720
what we know is that this microclimate

703
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,600
does really high cbg this microclimate

704
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,480
does you know really high cbd and how

705
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,480
can we help curate those for you um with

706
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,120
what we already have here and a lot of

707
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,038
our breeders have been testing in ways

708
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,519
and working with this plant in ways that

709
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,319
they can tell you that before

710
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,720
that

711
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:47,200
plant is fully developed you know what

712
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,519
are those strong traits gonna be

713
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,440
and it can actually happen a lot quicker

714
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:55,200
than people expect these days

715
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,320
yeah and that's a great point if if

716
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,840
folks are

717
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,119
i mean if the market's finally going to

718
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,000
mature we're going to get some more

719
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,918
diversity on the shelves they need to

720
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,119
access more diverse plants and that's

721
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,120
where you guys can play a key role and

722
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,278
so maybe that's a good segue to talking

723
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,839
about the uh the auction that you guys

724
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:18,558
are are looking to put on um and

725
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:22,319
how how a mechanism like that can help

726
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:24,480
sort of empower these legacy growers to

727
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,558
protect their intellectual property and

728
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,880
you know maybe get some recognition and

729
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,200
some some compensation for all the work

730
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,640
they've done well daniel mentioned the

731
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,759
emerald cup

732
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,240
and folks who win the emerald cup get a

733
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,480
lot more opportunities you know they get

734
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,720
recognition there's a lot of marketing

735
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,960
that comes with that

736
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,159
that isn't on the weight of that

737
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,640
producer

738
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,080
and so it's it's kind of like that but

739
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,038
instead of doing a um

740
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,879
a contest we wanted to create more

741
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,798
access to the market

742
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,760
and you know we already have seed

743
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:05,200
auctions and things like that and and so

744
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,640
what we wanted to do was create a way to

745
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,640
promote

746
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,799
and educate on more complex markets than

747
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,880
just selling your seeds or your plants

748
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,440
which are licensing agreements you know

749
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,679
a cosmetic company could want a certain

750
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,600
genetic for just their skin care and

751
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,759
another company could want the same one

752
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,079
for their drink line well that's a

753
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,000
diverse market for a breeder those are

754
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,519
two different licensing agreements that

755
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,679
they could create

756
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,319
and we feel there's a lot of power for

757
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,200
these small communities around those

758
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,839
kind of that kind of market

759
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,720
keeps everybody small keeps everybody

760
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:45,278
innovative and curating around the plant

761
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,399
um and then then the the big can go

762
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:50,240
outside um and so we really wanted

763
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,199
daniel and i have been in these

764
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,640
conversations around these particular

765
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,240
biz um this kind of licensing business

766
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,200
for i don't know about four or five

767
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,839
years

768
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,679
and it just always seemed like a really

769
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:07,759
good way to empower the high quality

770
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,759
small farmer which is really what our

771
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:14,480
culture was created around and yet also

772
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,319
educate the market on the value of the

773
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,480
genetic diversity

774
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:22,798
um and so an auction an event i've i

775
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,798
like throwing hype events i like

776
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,158
educating through those kind of

777
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,158
platforms

778
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,480
um and

779
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,120
we just saw it as an opportunity

780
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,558
um we started with just saying hey who

781
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,719
wants to come

782
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:38,639
and now we're at a place where we have

783
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,240
an amazing blockchain company called

784
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,038
canopyright that has created a platform

785
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,440
that

786
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,759
all breeders can

787
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,840
engage in for free

788
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,440
it doesn't cost unless you start

789
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:54,240
invoicing it through the through the

790
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,278
metric system and what that does is that

791
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,440
allows anybody to create a digital

792
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,000
archive of ownership so if their

793
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,798
genetics get out into the market without

794
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,798
their knowledge they have the first step

795
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,359
to saying this is mine

796
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:11,759
not yours and we really couldn't ask

797
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,439
people to come out of the you know start

798
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,119
throwing their stuff out in the market

799
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,558
and licensing agreements unless they

800
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,719
could protect it

801
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,798
uh then we wanted you know a lot of

802
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,600
people like to say oh we're the best in

803
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,759
in this industry is full of

804
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,240
smoke screens and we want to be

805
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:31,679
authentic in what we do and so we really

806
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,640
wanted to find a way to authenticate

807
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,000
and that's why we chose we were we were

808
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,440
given the opportunity to use the pre-96

809
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,079
skunk one

810
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,399
as a beta test and and the reason we

811
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,439
chose that is because it does have so

812
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:50,558
much controversy and notoriety

813
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,080
we just wanted something that we could

814
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,278
build

815
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,240
authentication and validate and because

816
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,159
there's so

817
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,278
so much controversy it's not going to be

818
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,320
easy

819
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,640
and so that means anything that follows

820
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:07,519
um it will be much easier so this is

821
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,399
it's our beta to help protect

822
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,120
help authenticate and help validate and

823
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,278
and the auction is really an event as a

824
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,359
tool to make it exciting and bring it

825
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,679
all together

826
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:22,158
yeah skunk is a lightning rod for a

827
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,038
controversy i like that component of it

828
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,200
and

829
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,839
i think like last week you know they're

830
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,759
circulating and calling each other out

831
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,879
on instagram which is just like a great

832
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,798
wwf match sometimes um if you're

833
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,960
watching uh and

834
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,960
they're they're you know signaling

835
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,200
people and and

836
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,200
what is it what is it about skunk that

837
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,519
that is so controversial

838
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,440
i it it is it gets people's attention

839
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,000
you know some of my favorite accounts

840
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,240
are responding to each other and have

841
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,720
opposite views and

842
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,200
yeah so i i think the skunk is is this

843
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,960
in the same sense mythological where

844
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,679
you're never going to get back

845
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,038
to the original skunk you just can't

846
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,720
because

847
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,398
there's no way to prove it anyway so i

848
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,640
think that building all of these

849
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,678
different skunk variations that are out

850
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,480
here and

851
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,200
tying them together and and tying it for

852
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,038
what reasons is really interesting

853
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,200
um and the skunk's really interesting

854
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,720
from a scientific perspective it's

855
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,798
scientifically

856
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,839
you know has something happening right

857
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:28,480
now where they're tying the thiol which

858
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,398
is like a unique component

859
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,038
constituents that haven't been tested

860
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,479
for traditionally in cannabis that you

861
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,398
know a humboldt state

862
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,360
professor at one point was the first to

863
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:42,079
discover this compound in actual skunks

864
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,719
so these different thio variations you

865
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:48,079
know can indicate different um skunk

866
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,000
species and in the first tests that were

867
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,839
you know being published

868
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,159
this

869
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,038
year uh

870
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,720
are kind of supporting that uh

871
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,679
that there's associations here with

872
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,759
these thiols and the smell of skunk so

873
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,480
it's really exciting um

874
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,720
just from all angles and so you you

875
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,079
layer dna and you layer cannabinoids and

876
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,000
you layer

877
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,519
you know popular opinion it's

878
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,878
irresistible

879
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:18,239
it's really fun i get to go meet an 84

880
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:20,559
year old archaeologist after this call

881
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,878
who was a part of a group that took a

882
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,279
pack of skunk seeds that were brought

883
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:27,118
back by a carrot woman who's still alive

884
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,720
she was also in her 80s and they hid it

885
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,960
in a cave

886
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,638
um and and we're going to go talk to see

887
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,320
if maybe he wants to go pull him out of

888
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,399
the cave now those skunk seeds pre-exist

889
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,159
these other skunk seeds right i mean

890
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,440
they're very old

891
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,838
so what what's fun about it is because

892
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,599
of all the controversy it's bringing up

893
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:51,279
more information more stories right it's

894
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,399
not about is this

895
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,280
mel frank pre whatever it's about how do

896
00:34:54,398 --> 00:35:00,000
we honor those legacies that brought it

897
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,880
before us and and how do we protect

898
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,800
those and keep those that move forward

899
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
on her because

900
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,920
many more genetics are going to be

901
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,838
created we all

902
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,320
living up here for as long we all know

903
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,078
how much we like to make new fun things

904
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,200
and with the science people are going to

905
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,599
really be able to hone in on that more

906
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,358
um and we just wanna show

907
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,960
that it's real

908
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,920
it's authentic

909
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,000
and that it's worth the value that we

910
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,079
we're gonna our validators are gonna say

911
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,199
it is

912
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,320
absolutely

913
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,239
yo and i wanted to come back to

914
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,160
something you touched on before lele

915
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,759
when you were we were talking about

916
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,838
sort of all the

917
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,160
generational knowledge that's been

918
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,480
accumulated um in humboldt and the

919
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:47,598
emerald triangle over the years

920
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,240
and sort of marrying that with sort of

921
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,640
the the new wave of research and you

922
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,639
know in science and

923
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,400
for me i get excited at that because you

924
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,920
know at canmed that's that's really what

925
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
we're trying to do is trying to bring

926
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,200
people from different parts of the

927
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,199
industry together to sort of collaborate

928
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,519
and sort of move the industry forward

929
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,679
and typically it's been sort of

930
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,759
having the healthcare providers talk

931
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,519
with the cultivators to talk about you

932
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,680
know the cannabinoids that they're

933
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,119
interested in to come maybe inspire the

934
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,199
cultivators to

935
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,559
to grow something new but i think

936
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,799
there's another component too right

937
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:24,480
where it's the legacy growers talking

938
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,240
with um you know the academics to

939
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,960
where there might be examples of things

940
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,639
where

941
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,480
i mean you guys know just from

942
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,719
experience that you know when the plant

943
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,519
looks a certain way or it's a certain

944
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,679
point in its development you do x

945
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,079
but you might not understand really why

946
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:43,440
that is the case and if we if we can

947
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,359
work together we can maybe determine

948
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,519
why that is and then even

949
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:48,719
optimize from there so that's that's

950
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,759
really exciting

951
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,399
it it it is and it goes beyond just the

952
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,800
science of the plant it goes into just

953
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,960
practical applications whether it be

954
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,519
you're giving a lecture and you talk to

955
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,599
someone in the legacy and they can give

956
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,079
you a perspective that you never had

957
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,200
before you know it's like it's like

958
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,560
i look at it as we are a region of

959
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:15,598
einsteins around this plant that have so

960
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:19,119
much experience that everyone who's

961
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,559
engaging should want an einstein is a

962
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,559
part of that conversation i've i am i

963
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,320
i'm trained i was trained as a nurse

964
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,480
before my spinal cord injury so i have a

965
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,920
little science background but not you

966
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,880
know heavy

967
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,358
yet i've been a part of an an artif two

968
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,280
artificial intelligence projects

969
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,440
just because they wanted that

970
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,800
understanding of the plant

971
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,720
um and and i've been a part i i i helped

972
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,400
influence doctor one of dr mackey's

973
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,039
talks on

974
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,480
extraction just through a conversation

975
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,358
that he felt really impacted that and i

976
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,240
think

977
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,078
we got to bring those two together to

978
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,679
really make this industry as

979
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,680
transformative as as it can

980
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,358
yeah and to that point the fact that you

981
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,519
that there is so much

982
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,838
generational knowledge and experience up

983
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,679
there in in humboldt in the emerald

984
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,679
triangle how

985
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,598
has there been any recruiters that have

986
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:21,440
come up there and tried to you know hire

987
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,440
people to go work for you know a big

988
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,519
corporate grow or something like that

989
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,800
and i mean would that even be something

990
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,719
that the folks up there would be

991
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,599
interested in

992
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,000
yeah we i have friends that are all over

993
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,320
the country right now helping people

994
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,199
develop their growth we we're

995
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,838
individuals um i don't ever like to tell

996
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,799
someone how to to live their life really

997
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,078
you know

998
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,960
um and personally i feel like we have to

999
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,079
integrate to educate so i'm really

1000
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,480
supportive of legacy operators going and

1001
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,880
working for larger companies or

1002
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,639
different companies to help them not

1003
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,480
just learn about the plant but learn

1004
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,879
about the values of our culture so

1005
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,960
they'll carry it through

1006
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,720
but traditionally we are definitely a

1007
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,240
nimby society

1008
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:14,480
we we definitely have shut people out um

1009
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,439
but i think as this market evolves and

1010
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,800
as our community transitions uh people

1011
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,320
are seeing that those are real

1012
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,200
opportunities for them as well um and so

1013
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,920
i hope we do have more people come up

1014
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:31,199
here recruiting and looking for support

1015
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,200
from from these areas

1016
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:37,279
yeah you see it failing on the other end

1017
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:40,838
you see it failing definitely in places

1018
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,839
that aren't uh traditionally cannabis

1019
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:45,920
cultivation locations but maybe

1020
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:49,679
have experience in agriculture

1021
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,920
in california and seeing them bring in

1022
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,639
like i said we don't name names but

1023
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,440
big managers from other companies that

1024
00:39:54,639 --> 00:40:00,078
are from the produce industry uh and are

1025
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,358
from the cut flower industry and

1026
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:07,440
seeing what doesn't convert and how that

1027
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:09,440
uh without that cannabis experience that

1028
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,440
it's definitely a recipe for failure so

1029
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,318
you're definitely seeing people come you

1030
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,000
know

1031
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,440
after kind of making some of the worst

1032
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,480
mistakes and that they should save

1033
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,039
themselves probably a lot of trouble um

1034
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,480
and start by integrating the the

1035
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,318
you know

1036
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,719
the right kind of legacy cannabis

1037
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:29,519
operator uh somebody with you know 20

1038
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:32,239
years of experience uh that still has

1039
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,000
energy um

1040
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,719
you know we've talked about how

1041
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,199
genetically diverse this plant is

1042
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,000
and that genetic diversity means how it

1043
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,118
responds to its environment its food and

1044
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,960
everything

1045
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,039
and when you don't have someone that

1046
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,358
understands those subtleties in your

1047
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:52,800
garden it it it can

1048
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,318
it can be a huge loss when you have

1049
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,880
someone that understands those

1050
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:59,599
subtleties helping you with that garden

1051
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,880
or product making or whatever that is

1052
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,760
you end up being ahead of the market in

1053
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,519
that because there's so many shortcuts

1054
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,280
and i don't mean regulatory shortcuts

1055
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,119
it's really just understanding of

1056
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,480
knowing how to navigate with the plant

1057
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,358
and work with the plant that your

1058
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,719
company will save

1059
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,159
all right i do want to be mindful of

1060
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:22,480
