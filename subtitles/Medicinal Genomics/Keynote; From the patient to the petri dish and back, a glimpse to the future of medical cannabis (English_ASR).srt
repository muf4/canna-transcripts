1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,129
everybody thank you very much it's a

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,769
pleasure to be back here actually quite

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:09,210
impressive audience after lunch I don't

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:12,928
think that I would come if I would

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,719
instead of you especially which I gave

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,320
this talk a year ago and signs not move

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:21,600
so fast unfortunately so I hope we have

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,849
a little bit new audience and I won't be

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:31,230
too boring so I want I want in this talk

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:34,799
in this hour that I have to show you how

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,429
I think the medical cannabis will be in

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,738
five years from now it's my opinion and

13
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:44,070
my father said that if you argue with

14
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,718
somebody 50% that you are wrong so it

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,988
might be that I'm wrong but that's how I

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:53,730
see it and I want to show it in a way of

17
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:56,128
to risk to a specific research that we

18
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:58,919
did in the lab in the last two years and

19
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,689
every one of them I think tank the

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,019
cannabis the medical cannabis to a

21
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:07,259
different angle and think to my opinion

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,770
we will see two different sides of the

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:19,680
coin in few years of medical cannabis so

24
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:22,438
let's start with this is okay just a

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,320
moment okay I will start with a very

26
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,989
short introduction but I think this

27
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,839
introduction actually I built it for

28
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:33,328
this conference a year ago as that was

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,020
my talk but today I want to show it as

30
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:38,250
introduction the cannabis plant is

31
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:41,219
amazing plant is a unique plant actually

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,640
Ruffy spoke this morning and said that

33
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,048
and talked about addiction and people

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,329
said that there is no addiction to

35
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,149
cannabis but I think it's it's wrong I

36
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:53,039
don't know anyone that started to work

37
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,030
with with this plant and not become

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,030
addicted to his work

39
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:03,829
so it's a unique plant

40
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:08,810
it's a crazy plant that affect our body

41
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:10,340
in many many ways and when I started to

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,830
work on cannabis and I read that is

43
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,180
doing everything reducing pain increase

44
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,850
appetite change your mood I didn't

45
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,879
believe it it didn't make sense to me

46
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,919
but four years later when I know how

47
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,250
it's affecting the endocannabinoid

48
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:30,559
system I understand why it's doing that

49
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,930
so our body and I'm sure everybody here

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,360
knows about it and also Rafi's spoke

51
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,659
about it so I would mention it too much

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,430
our body produces the same compounds

53
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,859
very similar actually they are not so

54
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,990
similar the three dimension structure is

55
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,540
similar but they are doing similar

56
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:50,239
effects in our body the endocannabinoid

57
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:51,739
system it's a regulation state system

58
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,289
it's a homo static system

59
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:57,500
the balancing outer system but it's

60
00:02:54,289 --> 00:03:00,709
actually involved in almost every system

61
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,870
in our body and balancing it it I'm

62
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,449
always giving the same example so I'm

63
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,659
sorry about that but it's the most clear

64
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:11,449
one that when we move near a barbecue

65
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:14,239
and we smell the barbecue smell small

66
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:16,729
molecules entering to our nose going to

67
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,060
our ala factory system signaling to

68
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:21,889
neurons that produce specific

69
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,449
endocannabinoid that will bind specific

70
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:25,669
neurons that will produce specific

71
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:29,599
signal to our liver and there is a

72
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:31,729
ningke's insulin a sorry to our Congress

73
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,609
would create insulin there is feedback

74
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:37,099
loop that increase our appetite so this

75
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,470
is the endocannabinoid system so it's

76
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:42,169
not surprised that cannabis increase and

77
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:47,389
our appetite so the endocannabinoid

78
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:50,869
system it's actually system that it's

79
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:53,329
signaling between cells one cell is send

80
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,360
the signal send a message to another

81
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,319
cells and this message is the real

82
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,900
material

83
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,958
it's a compound it's a secondary

84
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,438
metabolite we call it cannabinoids in

85
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,949
the endocannabinoid system so these

86
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:14,539
cannabinoids these chemical compounds to

87
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:17,488
have a pointer yeah this can

88
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:20,699
endocannabinoids will release from one

89
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:23,250
cell and bind a protein that will know

90
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,530
how to read this message and to signal

91
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,139
to the cell to do something this is the

92
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:31,168
endocannabinoid system it's involving so

93
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:35,519
many system and affect our body

94
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:37,228
regulation I think it's quite clear to

95
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,779
everybody that sit in the audience about

96
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:42,689
this system I'm just coming from

97
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,899
Baltimore last week from the NIH one of

98
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:47,639
the people that is a Nobel Prize

99
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:49,138
scientist and I don't I won't mentioned

100
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,319
his name because the story that I'm

101
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,180
going to tell when I showed this and

102
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,598
talk about the endocannabinoid system he

103
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,970
said [ __ ] said why he said I learned

104
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:02,879
medicine and I am a scientist I have a

105
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,280
Nobel no way there is a system that I

106
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,709
never heard about it said there were

107
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,948
three more than 3000 papers about this

108
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:12,959
system what do you mean said there is

109
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,509
like and there is receptors this is a

110
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,448
system right and we had this argue it

111
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:21,120
took me 15 minutes stopping my talk to

112
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:25,650
explain that there is a system in our

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:29,370
body that is working to regulate it so I

114
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:31,288
will go on this system have major to

115
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,209
compound there is the ligand and there

116
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:35,668
is the receptors mainly we are showing

117
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:38,819
these two receptors but there is other

118
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:41,250
many receptors that are playing a role

119
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,219
in the endocannabinoid system there are

120
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:47,430
GPR 55 GPR 3 and the TRP V family and

121
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:51,080
they more and more if you're doing a

122
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:54,000
bioinformatics we can find around 28

123
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:57,990
different receptors that participate in

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,110
the endocannabinoid action do we call

125
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,030
them endocannabinoid receptors no that's

126
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,699
a part of the endocannabinoid system

127
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:08,369
that regulates the system binding and

128
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,669
under my two AG other endocannabinoids

129
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,370
the answer is yes

130
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:15,579
if we're taking a GLAAD symbols and we

131
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,530
check how many nights how many messages

132
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:23,589
like that our body produce we can

133
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:25,909
analyze under up to 150 endocannabinoids

134
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:29,418
endocannabinoids like or enzyme that

135
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,570
participate in this process so 150

136
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:35,389
Campos that participate in this action

137
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:39,228
we call that endo can cannot be done

138
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:43,759
like proteome or metabolome because it's

139
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:46,639
so wide so it's a very very complicated

140
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,449
system in the body in very tight

141
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:54,400
regulation that signaling and balancing

142
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:57,500
other mechanism and system in our body

143
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,500
the cannabis plant is producing similar

144
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,319
compounds the feat of cannabinoids this

145
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,379
is the THC in other compounds we can

146
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,288
analyze at least 10 different families

147
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,959
of fetal cannabinoids in the plant and

148
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:14,060
altogether over than 140 feet of

149
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:17,329
cannabis from the plant and these

150
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,019
cannabis is just mimic the action that

151
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:23,870
is net-net native to our body natural to

152
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:25,909
our body instead of getting in out in

153
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,478
the end and the signals from the output

154
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:33,349
surrounding like a pain or like a smell

155
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:38,120
it will bind the receptor and will send

156
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:38,810
a signal as we smell a barbecue now just

157
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,098
a moment

158
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:45,110
and doing a mess here okay tonight we

159
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:47,930
smell the barbecuing the same signal

160
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,970
will enter so Rafi started to talk about

161
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:55,280
the end to the in terrassa fact which in

162
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,560
the past people show then we know it

163
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,138
from the patient Rafi have few papers

164
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,379
about the shine that if you taking one

165
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:08,538
compound is not working as good as the

166
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:10,788
whole extract but the reason or the way

167
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:13,819
its act usually the talaikan in a

168
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:16,969
receptor like a lock-and-key

169
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:20,870
we call it the locally key principle so

170
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,279
you need a one molecule that will fit to

171
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,358
the rest

172
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:28,329
in order to operate it and actually if

173
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:30,459
you have a key that is very similar to

174
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:33,399
the keys that operate but it's a little

175
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:35,979
bit different it will usually will enter

176
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,740
the lock but will stuck it we call it

177
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:42,009
agonist and antagonist or inhibitors and

178
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,688
activators so one molecule can activate

179
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:45,699
the receptors and the other one can

180
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:48,698
block it even though they looked

181
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:52,899
extremely extremely similar this is

182
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:55,750
biology basic biology but it's the same

183
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,990
in the endocannabinoid system and when

184
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:02,740
we adjust cannabis were not entering one

185
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,318
compound many compounds will enter on

186
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,169
our our body and will bind the receptors

187
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:10,360
on the cells and because I showed you

188
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:12,099
that there is many receptors and there

189
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,139
are many compounds every one of them

190
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,899
will bind different receptors and send

191
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:20,528
say a different signal to the cell and

192
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:24,490
we're getting a very complicated action

193
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:26,919
for me this is a major part of the in

194
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,750
terrassa fact this is the reason that

195
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:34,120
one compound is not acting as the whole

196
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,299
extract it's a complicated system we

197
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,769
call it synergism it's not a synergism

198
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,469
it's a complicated system we know

199
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:43,389
already at least from our epilepsy row

200
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,730
work that sometimes there's our

201
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:47,889
compounds as I showed you that blocking

202
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,139
the receptors and it can be in the same

203
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,938
extract a compounded blocking the

204
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:53,470
receptors and compounds that activating

205
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:56,708
the receptors there it there is a

206
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,259
competition between them so we have at

207
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:02,078
least one strain in Israel that when I'm

208
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:04,808
giving to the mice it should reduce

209
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:08,769
seizures a lot of high CBD there is also

210
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:11,588
CBD v all the integrators that I think

211
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:13,808
will block the seizures of the mats but

212
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:16,809
it's not working so what we did we

213
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:19,539
separate it to two parts 50 compounds in

214
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:21,730
50 compounds here and then one part is

215
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:23,318
working very well and the other part is

216
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,720
not working you put them together it's

217
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:29,318
not working anymore because in this side

218
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:32,678
there is something that inhibiting the

219
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:33,699
action so sometimes we get a different

220
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:35,889
action

221
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,750
not just because there is more component

222
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,389
activating but also there is things that

223
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:44,230
blocking or changing so again we are

224
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:48,129
talking about very complicated machinery

225
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:51,159
in our body so when we started to do

226
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:52,809
research four years ago we started and

227
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:56,799
asking what is the anti-cancer

228
00:10:52,809 --> 00:11:00,369
properties of cannabis in Israel we have

229
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,500
many many patients almost 20,000 that

230
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,299
getting the cancer patient that getting

231
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,269
cannabis but they are getting cannabis

232
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:10,719
as palliative care as improving quality

233
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:14,409
of life on top of the chemotherapy that

234
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,800
getting cannabis to reduce say nausea to

235
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:22,659
increase appetite to reduce pain but our

236
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:27,069
question was whether cannabis can have

237
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:28,719
can have effect on the real tumor but as

238
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,390
I told you there is many types of

239
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,540
cannabis and every one of them have many

240
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:37,179
compounds in cancer it's a given name to

241
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:38,980
hundreds of different diseases just in

242
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:42,039
breast cancer I'm familiar with more

243
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,870
than 40 types of breast cancer so how to

244
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:48,339
start and I'm sure that everyone that

245
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:51,100
know me show so these images already so

246
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,780
we'll do it fast with taking the cancer

247
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,490
cells that we are growing in a plate in

248
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,889
a plate like that there is between 3

249
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,680
million to 10 million cells depend on

250
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:02,559
the type of the cancer and we are

251
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,629
creating extract we are extracting the

252
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,179
active compound from the cannabis and

253
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:10,600
we're adding to the cancer so if we look

254
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:15,699
on colon cancer we see every dot here is

255
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,769
a cancer cell we adding the cannabis

256
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,710
extract number one and it's kill all the

257
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:23,350
colon cancers where the extract number

258
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,450
two we saw the same effect we add extra

259
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,629
number three and it didn't affect the

260
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:32,320
cells we did the same thing with breast

261
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:32,740
cancer and you show we saw very similar

262
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,900
effect

263
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,629
we took a prostate cancer and now the

264
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,459
one that didn't kill that sorry that

265
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:41,500
killed the colon cancer in the breast

266
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,870
cancer didn't affect the prostate cancer

267
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,340
the same thing with the second one but

268
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,470
the third one they did enough

269
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,930
the colon didn't affect the breasts now

270
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,810
killing the prostate cancer when we took

271
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:54,459
colon cells and not cancerous the

272
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:58,629
cannabis didn't affect them in that

273
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:01,870
amount so we ask ourself okay what is

274
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:04,570
doing this effect we read five compounds

275
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,310
four years ago and we saw that actually

276
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,240
extract number two and extract number

277
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:15,009
three are not different on the main find

278
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,629
fit of cannabinoids CBD and THC but it's

279
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:18,610
not surprising I already showed you that

280
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,620
there is many cannabinoids Fito

281
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,060
cannabinoids from the plant but also

282
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,060
there is turpan reads and there is

283
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:27,909
flavonoids all together around 500

284
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:31,239
active compounds in the extract so we

285
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:34,329
can't look just on five so we if you

286
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,730
taking 20 of these strains that we have

287
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,629
we have over the 900 different genetics

288
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,909
in my lab today

289
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:42,519
if you taking 20 of them and you measure

290
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:45,850
the Phaedo cannabinoids and we create a

291
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,769
system to do that a method to do that so

292
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,529
what you see here is the different Fito

293
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:53,710
cannabinoids and here are every line

294
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:55,269
it's a different genetic of cannabis and

295
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,070
you see when it's dark the meaning that

296
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,750
these feet of cannabis and highly

297
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,670
expressed here when it's why the meaning

298
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,620
it's not expressing here and you can see

299
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:05,679
the differences between the genetic how

300
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,360
much the active compound the Phaedo can

301
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,500
be no is it different between different

302
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,330
genetics of cannabis so actually it's

303
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,710
not surprising that one is killing and

304
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:19,480
the other is not but also I told you

305
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,570
that it's probably not the CBD indeed

306
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,310
see so if we want to measure it faster

307
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,730
we can do high-throughput screening we

308
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:30,189
can take a machine that can take fast

309
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,769
images from the plate and I won't go to

310
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,690
the details and we can put markers for

311
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:37,329
fluorescent markers and we just say that

312
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:40,780
every time that the cell is blue the

313
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,490
meaning is is alive and every time that

314
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,169
is read the meaning it's going through

315
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,409
apoptosis and is dying

316
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:49,689
and you see the control is blue these

317
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:52,088
train kill the cells very fast and this

318
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,420
trend not effective if we go to the stat

319
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:56,650
every color here it's a different

320
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:57,399
genetics different strain of cannabis

321
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,399
and with

322
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,610
take 4 micro gram per ml you can see

323
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:08,199
that there is few strains the didn't

324
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:10,930
affect they this melon or myself there

325
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,910
is few strains that kill 50 percent in

326
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:15,879
few strains that were very efficient

327
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:18,429
very similar to what I showed you if we

328
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,169
align these strains by the amount of CBD

329
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:21,969
indeed see we see that there is no

330
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:25,539
correlation between the amount it's in

331
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:27,940
CVD if we are taking one strain that

332
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:30,639
killed 70 percent of these cells and

333
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,320
we're extracting with purifying the T

334
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,500
it's in the CBD and we put them together

335
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,410
on these cells even if we put 20 times

336
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,350
small of this CBD and THC on these cells

337
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:45,250
it's not affecting the cells so it's not

338
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:47,259
that it's in CBD or it's not it's in CBD

339
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:51,279
alone maybe it's the interest maybe we

340
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:53,470
need everything if we're going now and

341
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,199
look on different types of cancer we see

342
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,600
the same problem different types of

343
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,050
cancer will act differently even though

344
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:06,580
it's the same genetic of the cancer so

345
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:11,319
we look on now couples these two just a

346
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:15,940
moment here these two are what is it

347
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:18,430
dissident cancer these two are melanoma

348
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:22,090
cancer these two are colon cancer and

349
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:26,229
you see that in these colon cancer there

350
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:28,750
is few extract they are very efficient

351
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,909
to kill them but on these colon cancer

352
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:35,080
we screened over than 800 different

353
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:37,659
extract none of them affect the cells so

354
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,940
even in the same cancer with a huge

355
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:42,730
difference so you can say hey that the

356
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,130
whisky extract what for work for colon

357
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,129
cancer we type of which types of colon

358
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:51,309
has what are the mutation which receptor

359
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:56,080
expressing on this one if a one don't

360
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:59,409
know it I don't know to fit it so how we

361
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,120
can do the research we can go narrow

362
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:03,519
deeper and deeper and deeper look on

363
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,519
what we call personal medicine we will

364
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,259
take a cancer let's say leukemia with a

365
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:11,559
specific mutations

366
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:15,039
specific phenotype and then we will

367
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:17,980
start to screening so in this case okay

368
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,440
before that we can take all the cannabis

369
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,650
that we have the 900 different genetic

370
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:27,309
lining can tell the computer in London

371
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:29,080
in group not its ECB dissimilarity all

372
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:32,710
the compounds and you can see by eye

373
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:36,099
that we're getting around five different

374
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:38,890
groups of cannabis not by T it's in CBD

375
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:41,529
all the compounds all the terpenes can

376
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,180
be new itself livening flavonoids we get

377
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:45,700
in groups so first of all we can choose

378
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,500
then from here then from here and from

379
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,680
here and then from here to start

380
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,319
screening and then we're taking one

381
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,080
types of cancer with specific mutation

382
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:59,049
and we started to screen on them so you

383
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:01,359
see here it's survivors so if the line

384
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:04,450
is lower the meaning more cells died

385
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:07,299
this is leukemia cells and you see that

386
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,029
most of the extracts that we use didn't

387
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:13,299
affect this leukemia but one extract was

388
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:15,009
very efficient to kill it and when we

389
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,919
find it something like that we are going

390
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:19,960
after the mechanism which receptors is

391
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,410
bind what is the pathway that being

392
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,140
operated which protein is upregulated

393
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,600
which protein is down regulator we're

394
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,570
taking and we prove terms of what we see

395
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:34,059
is right so now we tried on one cell

396
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:35,950
with one with specific mutation we're

397
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,960
taking the same type of cancer without

398
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,509
this mutation we see that it's not

399
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,370
affecting we're taking other two cells

400
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:44,109
with the same mutation we see on them

401
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:46,359
it's affecting we're repeating it on

402
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:48,789
other cells with the same mutation or

403
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,769
different mutation we're doing rescue

404
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:53,259
we're bringing back the protein we're

405
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:55,599
doing everything to prove ourselves that

406
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:59,349
the down-regulating proteins on these

407
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,509
specific cancer is going down that we

408
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:03,250
changing the mechanism we are proving

409
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:05,769
myself i don't want to go deeper in the

410
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,559
biology but we're doing everything to

411
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,660
prove ourself which proteins are polite

412
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,240
that which protein down regulated what

413
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,340
change in the ER that now it's blocking

414
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,990
these cancer non normal cells is not

415
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:19,069
doing we're doing everything to

416
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,288
understand what's happened

417
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:23,298
these specific cells and when we're done

418
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:26,750
with that we're going to mice model and

419
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:30,109
we're creating these tumors specific

420
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,058
tumors in these specific types of cancer

421
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:35,269
and we show that treating with this

422
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:38,148
extract reducing dramatically the size

423
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:42,380
of the tumors this is the start and this

424
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:44,268
is a representative image because it's

425
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,100
Willie leukemia we did a bone marrow

426
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,919
inter implantation we create the

427
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:51,349
Leukemia in this mice and we change many

428
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,690
many parameters of this leukemia we're

429
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:55,819
taking the tumors and we stain and we

430
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:59,600
see that there is a correlation of the

431
00:19:55,819 --> 00:20:02,480
cannabinoids in these tumors there is

432
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:05,839
accumulation we injected to the cannabis

433
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,028
to the valley of the to of the of the

434
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:12,408
page of them sorry patient my patients

435
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:15,798
have four legs and the tail so we inject

436
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:19,278
the mice to the valley of the mice the

437
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:23,359
cannabis and still accumulate on the

438
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:26,089
tumors which are on his back with this

439
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,918
is very surprising and I cannot explain

440
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:30,918
why it's accumulate this very lipophilic

441
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,870
the tumors are oily its makes sense but

442
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:35,629
we find the cannabinoids in the tumors

443
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:40,250
we see reduction of all the parameters

444
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:43,369
and so on but now the 100 million dollar

445
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,990
question usually I would say 1 million

446
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:47,599
dollar question but when the cannabis

447
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,200
field is nobody worked for 1 million

448
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:54,719
dollar

449
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:58,500
I tried to set 1 million but they didn't

450
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:02,069
listen to me so I change it so the

451
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,769
question why this train is different so

452
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:06,389
remember the group that we have so we

453
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:08,190
are going to make and we take all the

454
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,590
strengths that we have on that group and

455
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,170
we measure them and we see that we were

456
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:17,039
lacking the beginning to choose the best

457
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:19,289
one that we had so even though the same

458
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,509
amount CBD teets here and other

459
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:26,369
compounds is very similar there is one

460
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:30,779
that's working much better so do we need

461
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:33,689
all the compounds the in terrassa fact

462
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:38,519
do we need one special one do we need

463
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:40,320
two five seven I don't know what I do

464
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,289
know that I want to know

465
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,839
so my slogan to my students I want the

466
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:49,980
minimum compounds the doing the maximum

467
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:52,319
effect I don't want to reduce the effect

468
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,210
but I want to know what are the minimum

469
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,839
compound so how we're doing that with

470
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,549
fractionating the oil we taking the 100

471
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:03,240
compounds in the extract and we're

472
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:06,000
separating to four tubes 25 in each cube

473
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,539
you run it on HPLC preparative and you

474
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,910
dis a sect the XR the compound the first

475
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,950
25 will be in the fur in the first tube

476
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,920
the second one will be in the same in

477
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,110
the second 25 on the second tube and

478
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,300
then you've gone back to the cell zone

479
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:24,179
to demise and you check them so now

480
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,730
every color it's a fraction of this

481
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:29,490
extract the red one is the whole extract

482
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:32,549
and the other Carlos is a fraction so

483
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:38,130
you see the just one fraction is working

484
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:41,759
as good as the whole extract so you will

485
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:44,700
already eliminate 75% of the compound

486
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,710
that we don't need and you go and we

487
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,400
going back to this fraction and we cut

488
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,660
it again

489
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,519
so we now left with 25 compounds we

490
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,009
separate five five five and five and

491
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,000
going back to the cells and so on and so

492
00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:00,539
on until we reach in this specific

493
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,859
research

494
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:06,629
two three cannabinoid three cannabinoid

495
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:10,109
that you need the three of them in order

496
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:14,010
to get the same action as the whole

497
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:17,099
extract if you we purified 100% of the

498
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:19,529
three compound it's the same action of

499
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:21,809
the whole extract but if you take one of

500
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:23,700
them out it's not working as good as the

501
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,679
three of them you need the three of them

502
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,140
and we understand the mechanism one of

503
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,350
them binds cb1 receptors operating the

504
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,300
map and has the other one binded trpv1

505
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:35,429
changing the calcium release and this is

506
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:37,680
the reason in the ER it's signalling

507
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,990
when the standard mechanism but you need

508
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:44,480
the three of them to bind at least two

509
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:49,650
different receptors we used cannabis

510
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:52,319
plant extract one in just one in Israel

511
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,810
working for us for twenty half years

512
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:58,079
it's work perfect after two and a half

513
00:23:54,809 --> 00:24:00,000
years eight months ago my student came

514
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,250
to me said that he all the last

515
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,210
experiment that I did didn't work he

516
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:08,099
didn't kill the cells okay Ellie did you

517
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,900
tried not just in the mice did you try

518
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:10,409
out the cells yes I tried they don't

519
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,340
work

520
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:19,230
let's check it and we checking the

521
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:21,569
extract and I didn't tell you that one

522
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,250
of the compound it's even unknown

523
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:27,149
compound we call it three three one

524
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:28,410
eight B this is my students my chemists

525
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,300
they are not you know they're not

526
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:33,000
thinking out of the box instead of

527
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:36,569
killing this master killer try the sauce

528
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:42,299
I don't know you know twin three 180 now

529
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:45,089
we all stuck with it forever so this one

530
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:48,269
is a unique compound that you must have

531
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:51,029
it so after two and a half years the

532
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:52,920
glory the greenhouse in Israel we change

533
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:54,960
the regulation never mind they need to

534
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,330
move for one place to another place they

535
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,930
change the greenhouse the whole the hell

536
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:05,369
no what they change this soil the water

537
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:07,710
the light I don't know their strain is

538
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:09,439
not producing this compound anymore it's

539
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:12,000
not working

540
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,130
c4 wouldn't know

541
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,349
to analyze it and to know what is

542
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,840
missing I would say to early Haley you

543
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:19,199
were the great guy go to doing somewhere

544
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,919
else

545
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:29,250
eh deeds done sorry life sucks you know

546
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:31,200
I have my PhD but it's not working that

547
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:36,000
way now other students won't come to you

548
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:39,029
anymore so you can't so by knowing

549
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
exactly the compounds I can go to my

550
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:43,980
database tell to my student all go and

551
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,170
screen in all their extracts that we

552
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,349
have in the lab all the genetic which

553
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,940
one have these highly expressed so I

554
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:53,279
don't have the combination of the of

555
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,190
them in any of the strains but I have

556
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,019
other strengths at producing this one

557
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,570
one phone call to the Gloria I'm asking

558
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:04,349
one kilo of this strain next day I got

559
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:06,569
it you're fighting this adding it to the

560
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:10,319
other two from another extract when we

561
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:12,450
get in the same action exactly the same

562
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,179
one reducing the size of the tumor

563
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:18,000
hearing the leukemia and this is a proof

564
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,769
of a concept you can take one compound

565
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,410
room from here adding to here it's

566
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,910
working the same we need the three of

567
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:27,660
them doesn't matter where they're come

568
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:29,130
from we need the three of them they're

569
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,840
not not for a question

570
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,980
but it doesn't matter whether where

571
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:40,609
these come from so all these talk till

572
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,610
now I can show in many many other

573
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:47,519
example that we our work in our lab in

574
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:51,149
epilepsy different strain the same

575
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:54,269
amount of CBD and THC 20 to 1 ratio 5

576
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,430
milligram per kilogram CBD to 2m eyes to

577
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:59,099
a kilogram you can see different extract

578
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,779
effect differently the mice as long as I

579
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,459
won't go to the parameter that I will

580
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:05,490
said that the bar is higher the meaning

581
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,640
it's reducing more seizures same high

582
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:12,289
CBD low THC ratio 20 to 1 5 milligrams

583
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,660
per kilogram totally different action I

584
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:19,259
can show it in Alzheimer in epilepsy in

585
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:22,170
sleep disorder it's not just the CBD and

586
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:24,869
THC ratios it's other compounds it's

587
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:27,550
much more complicated

588
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:31,839
so everything that they showed you till

589
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:35,339
now was a very accurate scientific

590
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:39,909
approach and the second speaker today

591
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:42,519
that Dampier he did a PhD in the same

592
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:44,800
faculty that I did my PhD so when I

593
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,319
started he finished I admired him you

594
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,089
have one of the best laboratories in

595
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:52,149
Israel one of the best scientists in

596
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:54,419
Israel for sure and it's a privilege for

597
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:57,160
us that he started to work on cannabis

598
00:27:54,420 --> 00:28:00,690
but he said something that he's a

599
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,860
newcomer okay said if it's not accurate

600
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:09,390
compound that I can't produce synthetic

601
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:09,389
who cares 51,000 patient in Israel care

602
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:15,039
1,300 the lab tech kid in Israel care

603
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,170
they're not kidding single compound

604
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,920
ain't getting a whole extract with

605
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:22,480
reduced the seizures that help them to

606
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:27,210
maintain the day when they're getting

607
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:30,579
chemotherapy cannabis is a unique

608
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:34,090
situation that the world didn't face

609
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:36,639
till today we are treating hundreds of

610
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:39,339
thousands of patient not with a specific

611
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,880
compound that we produce synthetic in

612
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:45,669
the lab this is reality who cares what

613
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:51,550
you think this is reality the patient

614
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:53,980
get it every day if you didn't go to

615
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:56,409
this today to the dispensary you didn't

616
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:59,170
spoke with the patient you didn't get

617
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:01,840
seven calls every day from patient that

618
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:04,539
taking cannabis and need to know what is

619
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:07,000
the what to take how much then you can

620
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:09,519
said I can do it synthetically in the

621
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,230
lab who cares but if you walk in with

622
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,210
the patient with the hospital and

623
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,539
participate in 14 different clinical

624
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:18,730
trials you can't say who care but more

625
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:22,869
than that cannabis is a unique situation

626
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:26,049
I have one hour already I think forty

627
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:30,609
minutes so I'm fine with that I've come

628
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:33,159
is not running so let me check just how

629
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:35,028
much I have I don't have right now I

630
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:39,749
have half a now

631
00:29:35,028 --> 00:29:42,989
so cannabis is a unique situation and I

632
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:45,600
see the cannabis going sorry in two

633
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:48,230
different roads it's a monster with two

634
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,878
heads one of them I just showed you

635
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:53,489
accurate science specific compound

636
00:29:50,878 --> 00:29:55,888
binding specific receptors but the other

637
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:59,429
side it's the cannabis that most of us

638
00:29:55,888 --> 00:30:02,849
familiar two years ago I started a

639
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:05,100
clinical trial we on pain patient with

640
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:08,638
Professor a long Eisenberg the head of

641
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:10,378
the the pain department of Rambam

642
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:15,589
Hospital today is the head of the

643
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:20,069
Medical School of the Technion and his

644
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:22,189
student is a nurse in the hospital a PhD

645
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:26,819
student and we started to follow up on

646
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:30,149
2,000 pain patients how they react to

647
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:33,269
cannabis so if you go to this pencil you

648
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:35,518
speak with the glowers and I've in my

649
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:38,038
lab a database project which we are

650
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,190
following on many many patient you

651
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:43,710
hearing amazing stories in Israel there

652
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,929
is just one dispensary it's a mental

653
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,119
health health hospital the patient need

654
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,850
to come and they get the cannabis there

655
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:53,128
every glow wave eight authorized growers

656
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,569
will have a butcher that the patient

657
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:56,398
will come to get it from there

658
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:59,269
so we have to option all to get it to

659
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:01,949
your home or to count to come to pick it

660
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:03,808
so in this dispense we have two workers

661
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,389
that walking and questioning you the

662
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:09,798
patients when you are walking there and

663
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:13,288
you speak with the patient it's amazing

664
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:16,769
every patient tell you how he change his

665
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:18,419
life how he took opiates nothing helped

666
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:21,058
him and now it's taking cannabis and

667
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:22,859
totally change his life and in Israel

668
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:25,019
the medical cannabis is different from

669
00:31:22,858 --> 00:31:28,618
the stage of Canada these are real

670
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:31,169
patient in order to get cannabis for

671
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:33,898
pain in Israel you need at least one

672
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:37,470
year to be treated with other medicine

673
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:40,969
under hospital care so you need to have

674
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:43,379
chronic pain for at least one year

675
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,670
treated by many other medicine that

676
00:31:43,378 --> 00:31:47,369
didn't help you

677
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:50,250
then you can get cannibus if you're a

678
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:53,219
poletik kid you need at least to try

679
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:55,049
five different medicine before you can

680
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,029
get cannabis so these are kids at

681
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:59,789
resistance to other medicine so these

682
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:02,250
are very severe patient and these are

683
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:03,720
amazing stories you're going to have a

684
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,140
banana hospital you speak with the

685
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,150
patient I am doing once a month and

686
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,280
these are amazing stories a pities

687
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:14,040
depletion that told you how we can't get

688
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,559
out live of the house if two baby seals

689
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,629
did not let anyone to touch them every

690
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,119
time that is getting medicine is getting

691
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:23,430
to their hospitals because is becoming

692
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,339
now and now the cannabis changes live

693
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:27,720
all these stories and you think to

694
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:30,769
yourself while we are giving other

695
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,120
medicines if this is working so good

696
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:35,519
this is because we are not doing really

697
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,789
clinical trials we don't do really bill

698
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,150
we are not really doing what medicine

699
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:43,799
physician need to do we look just on the

700
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:46,470
patient that it was a success

701
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:49,049
how many patient trying didn't work for

702
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:51,240
them we don't know who is coming to

703
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:53,549
dispensary to take cannabis every month

704
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,460
just the one that tried and it worked

705
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:59,940
for him who is feeling the questionnaire

706
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:02,789
just the one that he tried and worked

707
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,400
for him this is not a real trial

708
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:08,250
how many tried and it didn't work for

709
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,100
him how many tried and it make harm from

710
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:13,619
them one of my students and work on the

711
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:16,259
way on the bar informatics in my lab

712
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:20,009
came to me is the Italian guy very sweet

713
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:24,680
guy came to me daddy I know what we need

714
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:29,519
to publish at South except on the pizza

715
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:31,470
what else he said daddy cannabis is very

716
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,960
very safe said why are you saying that

717
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,910
sound said if I look on all the 5000

718
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,970
patient in our database

719
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:42,300
none of them tell that the cannabis made

720
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:44,130
any harm so oh this is very cool so how

721
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,690
many patients feel five out of the

722
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,240
question me they are feeling every month

723
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,830
if I've got the question you stop query

724
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,549
every feeling said I don't know except

725
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:55,559
press the button tell me it said to me

726
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:58,649
357 patients that you know they all died

727
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:01,109
right said no why not the field

728
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:03,870
items and disappear no cannabis is not

729
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:05,579
killing said no no it's not killing but

730
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:07,859
you know that they have a bleeding in

731
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:09,299
the valley and they went to the hospital

732
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:13,069
this is the reason they stopped taking

733
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:15,990
cannabis no cannabis not wear any harm

734
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,760
guys this is not science this we

735
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,869
deciding what will be the answer we

736
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,760
don't know what's happened to the

737
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:24,449
patient that didn't feel the question

738
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,990
near the disappear we assuming what we

739
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:30,859
assuming why the stop if it was so good

740
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:35,369
we don't know we're doing science

741
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:38,370
without really doing science so we

742
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:40,799
started to do a clinical trial on pain

743
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:43,469
patient from the moment that the

744
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,980
physician is decided to prescribe

745
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:49,230
cannabis they treating one year of other

746
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,240
medicines and after one when you Raylan

747
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,460
said you know what I think it's time to

748
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:56,419
start cannabis from that moment we

749
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,550
started to follow and actually

750
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:03,720
unfortunately it's a very very very

751
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:08,220
disappointing result just 45 of the

752
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:12,329
patient describing improve of the pain

753
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:15,389
and in these forty five percent of the

754
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:17,569
patient so fifty-five tried said didn't

755
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:20,849
help I don't want anymore

756
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:25,110
45 percent described that it's helped

757
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:26,719
them just forty five percent the one

758
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:30,480
that described it it's helped them

759
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:33,629
saying that it reduced something like 25

760
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,909
percent of the pain in order that the

761
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:41,190
medicine for pain to be authorized to

762
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:43,670
pass the threshold we need to reduce

763
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,889
more than thirty percent of the pain so

764
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:50,180
actually none of the strains in Israel

765
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:53,549
none of the patient cross the threshold

766
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:56,319
so actually cannabis it's not a good

767
00:35:53,550 --> 00:36:00,440
medicine for pain

768
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,720
that's the results 45% just 45% did help

769
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,380
them the one that helped them it didn't

770
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:10,009
really help them in vain there is almost

771
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:14,930
40% placebo so 45 is not far from the

772
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:16,490
placebo so now I need to ask myself and

773
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:19,849
mainly I need to ask me kid or that

774
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:23,089
sitting here good friend of mine that

775
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:27,049
authorized all the patient in Israel why

776
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:28,880
we have almost 20,000 patient pain

777
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:33,230
patient that getting cannabis in Israel

778
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,240
it doesn't make sense right and how come

779
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,119
that you speaking with them they telling

780
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:41,239
you that they save their lives it's not

781
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,759
make sense but if you going forward and

782
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:47,000
ask the other parameter that we are

783
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,400
asking how it's always effect your

784
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,190
anxiety how it's effect your depression

785
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,730
how its effect your disability you see

786
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:58,280
that in any one of them we have an

787
00:36:54,730 --> 00:37:00,710
improvement not a big one not the best

788
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,260
treatment for depression not the best

789
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:07,010
treatment for anxiety but in all of them

790
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:11,260
we have a reduction we have improvement

791
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:15,080
if you look on sleep it's improved sleep

792
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:17,360
so actually if you look on Adam medicine

793
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:20,750
that this patient are taking there is a

794
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:23,840
huge drop-off of the add medicine look

795
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:27,320
on the opioids so if it wouldn't help

796
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:30,110
them how come the 20,000 patient in

797
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,660
Israel isn't a small quantity 20,000th

798
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:35,730
like 80% of our population right

799
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,730
[Music]

800
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:42,460
so how come that we have such a big

801
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,710
amount of pay of patient that withdrawal

802
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:48,250
other if it wouldn't reduce the pain why

803
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:52,409
they stopping taking our the medicines

804
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:56,019
so if we look on one important parameter

805
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:58,149
this is the improvement of the pain you

806
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:03,329
see that the improvement is very very

807
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:05,680
minor but this is called cut

808
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:10,029
catastrophism okay

809
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:12,839
the meaning is how the patient see his

810
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,019
pain what do you think about this pain

811
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,059
okay

812
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:19,150
I know that there is a lot of Israelis

813
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:23,369
here we call it the effector Paulo knee

814
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:26,590
how much you complain about your pain

815
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:32,159
and you see that there is a huge

816
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:35,800
improvement of how the patient see oh

817
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:38,349
what is the concept of the pain in the

818
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,600
beginning and what is the concept of the

819
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:44,949
pain there in the end there is a huge

820
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:50,369
improvement and I will give you one

821
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:53,799
example this improvement changing

822
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:57,639
something this is critical is changing

823
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,950
the quality of life I will give you one

824
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:03,279
example one patient that I know from

825
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:06,369
this questionnaire 20 years old patient

826
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,700
did suffering from neuropathic pain in

827
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:12,639
his back his living is in the basement

828
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:15,250
of his parents he's not working almost

829
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:18,879
not getting out of his bed he's putting

830
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:21,760
a earphones and and earrings earphones

831
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,200
hearing earphones and in here music most

832
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,600
of the dasie music

833
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:30,309
he said that it's reducing his pain very

834
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:32,079
loud music he stopped working he is high

835
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:35,949
depression taking medicine for

836
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,159
depression and he starting to take

837
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:40,969
cannabis the cannabis improved a little

838
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:43,779
bit the pain

839
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:46,189
but his improve his sleep disorder

840
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:48,680
reduce the depression he stopped taking

841
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:51,079
the medicine for the depression he

842
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:52,578
starting eating better he starting

843
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,519
feeling better he's starting to go to

844
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:57,769
work again he started to have money

845
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,679
he's starting to go out with his friend

846
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:03,199
he met a girl in the pub he became his

847
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:05,868
boyfriend they moved to to live together

848
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,480
and now that two weeks before the

849
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:10,510
wedding so he's still very happy is two

850
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,960
weeks before the wedding it's before

851
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:16,000
getting down the table but think about

852
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,720
it seriously

853
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:23,949
the huge change of the quality of life

854
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:27,529
this guy before that in his bed

855
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:30,348
depression not working now live with his

856
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:32,810
girlfriend full-time job have a normal

857
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:42,730
life and now you ask him what you think

858
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:45,559
about his pain sorry what oops no good

859
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:49,818
just a moment this is the next talk in

860
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:53,000
Arizona and if you ask him what you

861
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:56,150
think about his pain in the beginning it

862
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,440
was he horrible but it's improved he

863
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,440
don't care about the pain anymore

864
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:07,129
this is cannabis and this is a different

865
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:09,190
road if you ask me how I see it in five

866
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:13,519
years

867
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:16,970
these are 85% of the patient in Israel

868
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:19,759
patient that get cannabis for improving

869
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:21,519
the quality of life this obtain patient

870
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,160
Lisa

871
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:27,800
dissipation with PTSD dissipation that

872
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:30,348
getting chemotherapy and getting

873
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,690
cannabis to improve all the effect the

874
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:35,300
side effect of the chemotherapy these

875
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:37,068
are the majority of the patient so if

876
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,970
you ask me how is it in five years there

877
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:44,509
is two road there will be cannabis as a

878
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:47,750
medicine in the pharmacist but there

879
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:50,000
will be two types of medicine they will

880
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,280
be very accurate may be synthetic maybe

881
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,780
not synthetic but very accurate three

882
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,750
molecules in

883
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:59,510
in the bottle measured exactly the

884
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:03,289
amount milligram per ml that you will

885
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:06,290
take to treat cancer that you take to

886
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:09,590
treat epilepsy that you take to treat

887
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:13,099
insomnia very specific illnesses and

888
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:17,120
there will be cannabis which much more

889
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:19,369
holistic the whole extract because we

890
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,130
are the scientists will never be able to

891
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:23,989
put our finger on all of these because

892
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,930
these three compounds will improve the

893
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:28,569
appetite and these two is a changing the

894
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:31,369
sleep disorder and these five is

895
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:35,600
increasing decreasing the depression and

896
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:38,359
all together you get something to change

897
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,949
the quality of life all the ripple

898
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:43,160
cancer patient

899
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:49,039
it is the patient pain patient we use

900
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:52,339
probably this cannabis but this is not

901
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:56,150
saying that we need to stop working on

902
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:58,579
that we need also here to improve it and

903
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,430
to bring it to the level that it will be

904
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:04,250
medicine accurate that every time that

905
00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:07,309
you going and buying a bottle it will be

906
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:10,219
the same the girl we need to improve the

907
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:12,110
way they grow it this must be accurate

908
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:15,259
that all the compounds inside will be

909
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:17,930
the same we will be able to measure I am

910
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:21,530
able to measure today so will the world

911
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:24,379
will know how to do that we will know

912
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:27,500
how to grow it more efficient cheaper

913
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:31,450
without pesticides that all the time it

914
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:34,820
will be the same and we can make it also

915
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:37,609
more accurate and I want to give one

916
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,680
sample what we did occur with the

917
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:45,050
collaboration with Professor Dan lavitus

918
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:49,730
we create a nano beads that having

919
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:53,019
inside of them a whole extract these

920
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:57,740
nano beads capture a whole extract and

921
00:43:53,019 --> 00:44:00,759
these nano beads release the extract in

922
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:00,759
slow release

923
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:04,650
so actually where the whole extract all

924
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:09,119
the chickens are flavonoid in

925
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:11,490
cannabinoids but these nano beads now

926
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,769
release all the active compounds

927
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:16,469
slowly slowly so if we're taking these

928
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:20,070
nano beads and inject under the skin of

929
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:22,500
the mice that have epilepsy and we

930
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:24,059
measure we see that the coup that they

931
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:28,530
built in two weeks

932
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:30,509
slowly slowly releasing the cannabis

933
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:32,550
they can't be new it's Japanese and

934
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:37,080
flavonoids and we can measure it in the

935
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:39,660
blood if we look on the seizures we see

936
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,000
that actually the whole extract in the

937
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:44,819
beads working better than the whole

938
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,820
extract that been giving on the daily

939
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,680
basis to the mice so we're we're giving

940
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,860
it one in two weeks

941
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:56,279
and here it's months one every day it's

942
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,960
the same extract but this one worked

943
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,030
better because you don't have the peak

944
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,010
of getting and going down and up an hour

945
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:05,700
down and up in the blood it's the

946
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:08,070
sustainable amount if we measure the CBD

947
00:45:05,699 --> 00:45:11,368
and other compounds in the blood we see

948
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:13,680
that in the bitter is much more than

949
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:17,039
when we're injecting them so this is

950
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,169
just a small example to show you that

951
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:22,230
even when we stand in the whole extract

952
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:25,829
we will find a way to make it more

953
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:29,159
accurate better matches to vipe it

954
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:32,759
better whatever we need even in that

955
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:36,659
road to be much more accurate to bring

956
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:39,600
it to the level that the physician will

957
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:42,719
trust what is giving will know what is

958
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,389
giving how it's acting the patient we

959
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,639
know it's good to him but we know to go

960
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:51,989
back and to buy all the time the same

961
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:54,839
product we don't have it today so I want

962
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:58,319
to thank my amazing team that did all of

963
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:02,130
this work this is dr. Shirley where I

964
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:04,380
usually surely be a bellman they did all

965
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:06,750
the analysis in the Phaedo cannabinoids

966
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,869
an endocannabinoid dr. lee Rhonda Rhonda

967
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:11,440
did all the work of the cancer together

968
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:13,930
with the early

969
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,450
this is the student dr. Gil Levin who's

970
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:18,969
doing all the neurobiology in the lab

971
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:22,828
and you see the epilepsy and all my

972
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:22,828
amazing team thank you very much

973
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,869
[Applause]

974
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:41,450
questions hello

975
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:44,569
I had a question about this slide that

976
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:46,129
you showed that had the red bars and the

977
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:49,580
blue bars

978
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:52,039
it appeared that after 120 days on the

979
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:54,590
blue side you actually saw a greater

980
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:57,889
amount of catastrophizing I don't know

981
00:46:54,590 --> 00:47:01,730
if that was interpreted correctly and

982
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:04,670
then my second question is the imaging

983
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:06,920
that you did was that using an in cell

984
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:10,849
what was that using just a woman this is

985
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,889
what you asked you so this is improved

986
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:15,679
in the catastrophe

987
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:18,920
this is improve oh I see I see okay I

988
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:21,500
did a large argument with my students I

989
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,510
said improve I want to see it up so even

990
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,119
though the catastrophe oh yeah I missed

991
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:28,520
seeing that okay improvement I guess

992
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:31,759
yeah there was no indication there so

993
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:33,769
improving pain and improving the

994
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,650
catastrophe okay

995
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:39,489
the other question was what was it the

996
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:43,309
imaging that you did what was that using

997
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:46,109
which which equipment yes where many

998
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:48,630
where thank you side with the

999
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:51,570
molecular device I forgot the name we

1000
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:54,150
have like three different this one form

1001
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:57,690
the molecular device what kind of

1002
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:59,460
instrument was it my wife said that that

1003
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:03,269
will never will have Alzheimer because I

1004
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:06,820
remember nothing okay you can I will

1005
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:10,030
catch me after I will check for you okay

1006
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,030
[Music]

1007
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:19,530
hi over here it's Matt Gordon again I

1008
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:23,579
had a question about you've discovered

1009
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:25,710
uh you've narrowed it down by the

1010
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,389
process of elimination and discovered

1011
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:32,309
three cannabinoids that worked as good

1012
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:34,409
as the whole and what happens if you

1013
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:36,920
took that profile that you knew was

1014
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:40,949
killing that type of cancer and you

1015
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:43,289
mixed it with some other oil would that

1016
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:46,169
suddenly change the profile and make it

1017
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:47,969
not kill that cancer anymore it's not

1018
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:51,869
it's not changing the profile but it's

1019
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:53,489
will dilute the specific cannabinoids to

1020
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:56,159
a different amount so you will need to

1021
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:59,219
give more this is first and second its

1022
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,049
might be that in the other extract there

1023
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:03,059
will be things that competing with the

1024
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,760
receptors and will block it it might be

1025
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:08,940
I never tried it so I don't know to tell

1026
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,220
okay III well I didn't try to mix it

1027
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,929
with other world that's a common thing

1028
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:15,539
as you know in the United States people

1029
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:17,399
take five or six or twenty strains make

1030
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:20,550
oil and combine it all together to

1031
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,519
hopefully hit all the receptors are cure

1032
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:25,830
you know for cancer they take sixty

1033
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,409
grams and 90 days of ethanol extract

1034
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:30,599
right Rick Simpson oil and I was just

1035
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:32,789
wondering into me it's remind it remind

1036
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:37,139
me a joke that we telling in Israel that

1037
00:49:32,789 --> 00:49:39,329
again I need to go to do a P exam that

1038
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:41,849
how you saying that that yeah that's the

1039
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:43,469
terminology so he's coming and said I

1040
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:44,839
brought all the family check it all

1041
00:49:43,469 --> 00:49:47,750
together so

1042
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:50,329
I don't know if it's smart you know yeah

1043
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:52,190
so what do you but you haven't you guys

1044
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:54,380
haven't mixed oils and seen if it was

1045
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:56,539
still effective or in the end if you had

1046
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:58,340
something that cured another cancer like

1047
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:00,230
a completely different compound after

1048
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:02,420
mixing 20 different strains or what have

1049
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:06,380
you it's a good idea I need another 45

1050
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:11,210
students I will work on that okay thank

1051
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:13,730
you we didn't thank you thank you hi hi

1052
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:17,900
I see nothing so I'm just that's okay

1053
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:19,849
nice yeah so for some of the diseases

1054
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:23,090
are complaints that you were talking

1055
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:24,920
about pain and epilepsy those the

1056
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:27,050
medicines that are often prescribed for

1057
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,750
those types of things have really bad

1058
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:32,539
side effect profiles destroy organs and

1059
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:34,400
things like that so my question is why

1060
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:36,829
is cannabis a last resort with such a

1061
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:44,570
benign side-effect profile for cannabis

1062
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:46,549
why is cannabis the last choice so it's

1063
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:48,320
- good answer for that first we don't

1064
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,240
know that the damage is cannabis is

1065
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,130
doing we don't really know we're

1066
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,709
assuming it's not doing which is not

1067
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:57,289
really true if you really following on

1068
00:50:54,710 --> 00:51:00,230
Rick Simpson oil patient they have a lot

1069
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:02,449
of bleeding in their intestines and

1070
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:05,210
there is damage that cannabis can do and

1071
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:08,779
we we're not we don't know yet okay I

1072
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:11,119
showed in in their publication with

1073
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:13,820
Professor Gilbert Sela a few months ago

1074
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,039
that if you taking immunotherapy with

1075
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,200
cannabis cannabis is actually blocking

1076
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:21,019
the immunity issue said why not to give

1077
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:23,719
everybody I'm not sure it's it's right

1078
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:26,360
thing second because we're better

1079
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:28,459
medicines in other illnesses sometimes

1080
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,070
work a physician need to check is

1081
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,409
patient and to choose the best medicine

1082
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:35,930
that's working the best for this patient

1083
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:37,399
it's not always the cannabis and and you

1084
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:39,169
know it's nice in these conferences we

1085
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,750
said why not to give but it's the

1086
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:43,369
physician responsibility to choose what

1087
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,349
they think is the best for the for this

1088
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:49,609
patient and I hope they are doing that

1089
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:53,210
and unless we will have more data to

1090
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:55,039
know and what were to give in which

1091
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:57,480
patient which will take more time and

1092
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:01,199
I'm quite aligned with the physician on

1093
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:05,460
and there is a lot of I don't know how

1094
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:08,219
to set it in English but this

1095
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,659
information and things about cannabis

1096
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:12,839
that caused the physician not to give

1097
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:15,539
them and I'm giving free to do to the

1098
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:21,150
mine so I don't have this problem thank

1099
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:23,279
you hi I was just curious if you'd

1100
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:26,519
identified a molecular target yet for

1101
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,830
your 331 b8 compound or if you know

1102
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,409
mechanistically how that's working no I

1103
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:33,210
know it's binding trpv1 but I don't know

1104
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:36,000
mechanistically it's binding and the

1105
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:38,340
releasing calcium I don't know exactly I

1106
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,409
know that when I'm blocking trpv1 then

1107
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:42,510
it's not binding and whether I'm not

1108
00:52:40,409 --> 00:52:46,139
there yet it took me a lot of time to be

1109
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:48,090
able to purify that in a good way and to

1110
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:50,309
have it really purified in my hand

1111
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:52,680
actually it's just a few months and

1112
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:55,289
every time it take me around three weeks

1113
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:57,299
to get it so still there is there is

1114
00:52:55,289 --> 00:53:00,059
technical things that takes a lot of

1115
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,710
time if I'm summarize what I succeed to

1116
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:04,710
do in the last four years is not the

1117
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:07,260
results is to build the tools to ask the

1118
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:10,019
questions few months ago I think four or

1119
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:13,440
five months ago I sat with my students

1120
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:15,570
said they show results that we reached

1121
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,909
the point that we can really start ask

1122
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:19,170
questions and answer that when we are we

1123
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:21,149
have the ability to measure the

1124
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,159
endocannabinoids the receptors the Fito

1125
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:25,320
cannabis to analyze them to separate

1126
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:30,899
them before that we didn't have the

1127
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:33,000
tools thank you the dr. Mary Kristen

1128
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,309
Walsh Lange all hearts is Hawaii now I

1129
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,900
can imagine who is talking yes

1130
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:41,429
so long from the back an interesting

1131
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,720
thing happened last year and I don't

1132
00:53:41,429 --> 00:53:45,299
know if you've seen it or if you might

1133
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,459
be curious about it I have an irregular

1134
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,140
heartbeat since youth needed a pacemaker

1135
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,990
but this was before we knew I needed

1136
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:54,239
that I'd stopped my beta blocker and it

1137
00:53:51,989 --> 00:53:56,039
coincidentally I was with an implant at

1138
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,619
cardiac monitor 24-hour monitoring

1139
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:00,659
recorded bottom line is I stopped the

1140
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:02,849
beta blocker so the doctor could see my

1141
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:05,849
rhythm and my rhythm stopped misbehaving

1142
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:08,159
turned out I had simultaneously started

1143
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:09,900
using a dilution of beta Kari offline or

1144
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:13,469
leave about four hundred five hundred

1145
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,150
milligrams a day in divided doses and I

1146
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:17,489
realized after two months without a

1147
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:18,990
single episode of arrhythmia that there

1148
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:21,869
might be something going on because I

1149
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:23,639
found one preclinical research on triple

1150
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:26,250
negative breast cancer cells that had

1151
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:27,929
beta-2 adrenergic receptors on them and

1152
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,670
they claimed it was an inverse agonist

1153
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:31,859
and I just thought I'd toss that out

1154
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,510
there's a softball because we're talking

1155
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,820
about the entourage effect if there's a

1156
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:38,490
beta blocker effect with the most common

1157
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:41,640
turkeying beta carry off way maybe we

1158
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:43,589
can start to elucidate this I mean it

1159
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:45,210
doesn't distinctly have the anti-cancer

1160
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:46,490
aspect though there is some of that in

1161
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:49,170
cancer research it's more about just

1162
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:51,659
kind of clarifying this when it's a

1163
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:53,369
molecule we're seeing an uptick in use

1164
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:56,369
you have any knowledge on the beta carry

1165
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:59,279
opportunities in beta blocking yeah I

1166
00:54:56,369 --> 00:55:02,309
think I will answer that generally first

1167
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,800
of all I I didn't I didn't work

1168
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:10,739
specifically with better kirvline like I

1169
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:13,200
never separated from the others and in

1170
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:14,879
general I think what we will see in the

1171
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,579
next few years that there were few

1172
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,490
indication will will disappear and few

1173
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:22,739
things that will appear and I think hard

1174
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:23,849
diseases and affecting on heart and

1175
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:26,549
other things like that

1176
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:30,089
would be major because the heart is full

1177
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:32,400
of endocannabinoids and I know it's been

1178
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:35,400
affected by cannabis and by terpenes and

1179
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,070
by the flavonoids flubbing will be a and

1180
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,809
B being shown to affect them so I'm

1181
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,930
quite sure it's will be a big I was just

1182
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:43,400
curious because they distinctly

1183
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:47,179
confirmed in the preclinical research

1184
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,680
about the beta-2 adrenergic receptor it

1185
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:50,989
was an inverse agonist and that's the

1186
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:54,879
only note so I just thought I think yeah

1187
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:54,879
I much for all your work thank you

1188
00:55:55,099 --> 00:56:01,190
hey Danny hey Murr just play boys okay

1189
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:03,469
you know it's me just for my boys right

1190
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:06,559
quick quick question is the standard

1191
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:08,149
available for the 3 3 1 1 8 B 4

1192
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,750
ain't no well when are you gonna make it

1193
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:14,660
available so that we can all test for it

1194
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:17,960
I'm working on that literally I send my

1195
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:20,239
you know two of my workers last week to

1196
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,130
the states to examine which best

1197
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,779
equipment to buy for that in order to

1198
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:27,108
start to purify it in a better way

1199
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:30,019
because now I'm pure fighting then using

1200
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:32,000
it to my research but it takes a lot of

1201
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:35,239
time and a lot of efforts I need to do

1202
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,869
more efficiently I hope to have it and

1203
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:41,269
you know I'll be waiting and we're

1204
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:46,809
creating notice to give it away ok we'll

1205
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:51,318
be ready okay hey I'm dr. Prendergast

1206
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:54,559
primary care physician from Jamaica we

1207
00:56:51,318 --> 00:57:00,489
have lots of cannabis there as you know

1208
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:02,019
but we have very little puree purified

1209
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:04,848
[Music]

1210
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:07,880
product that we can use I have found in

1211
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:09,769
my practice that the best one that I can

1212
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,990
use is a three to one ratio which is

1213
00:57:09,769 --> 00:57:18,170
three cvd to one THC which is the most

1214
00:57:11,989 --> 00:57:19,068
useful however being limited to only a

1215
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:24,079
few

1216
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:24,980
right now legislatively is do what would

1217
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:30,490
you say

1218
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:33,650
CBD alone for I use it for inflammatory

1219
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:35,079
conditions I use the CBD CBN which is

1220
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,700
also available

1221
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:42,029
those are the only two that are

1222
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:45,269
available legally and so broad-spectrum

1223
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:50,080
what do you think about a three-to-one

1224
00:57:45,269 --> 00:57:51,280
CBD to THC so first of all I think you

1225
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,190
need to understand that I'm not a

1226
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,760
physician and I don't know what is good

1227
00:57:54,190 --> 00:58:00,309
for patient or not I know to look for

1228
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:03,250
mechanism to answer a big question to

1229
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:05,409
look on the wide the aspects I don't

1230
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:08,530
know to treat patient unfortunately and

1231
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:11,440
I don't know the answer but basically I

1232
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:13,930
would say in the cannabis field to say I

1233
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,480
found three to one is the best ratio and

1234
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:17,079
will ask to make me sleepy o to make me

1235
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,579
awake

1236
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:20,679
what do you mean the best one the best

1237
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:23,650
one for what to every indication on

1238
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:27,419
every disease no it's different like

1239
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:31,380
inflam inflammatory conditions

1240
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:36,300
autoimmune conditions I found that to be

1241
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:40,300
C is CBD three CVD to one THC on

1242
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:44,740
activated of course and I found that to

1243
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:47,920
work very well with the limited scope so

1244
00:58:44,739 --> 00:58:49,809
we like the broad spectrum so so you're

1245
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,420
taking a specific strain and it's worked

1246
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:54,039
for you three two one and I learned from

1247
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:58,210
cooking what is work for you don't

1248
00:58:54,039 --> 00:59:01,360
change but but we work on multiple

1249
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:02,110
sclerosis multiple clones it's kind of

1250
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,470
inflammation

1251
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:07,450
I have strained that causing the disease

1252
00:59:05,469 --> 00:59:10,149
to be so severe that they might not

1253
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:12,819
survive and I have strange that the

1254
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:15,639
mines are almost curing from the disease

1255
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,680
with the same ratio of CBD and THC so I

1256
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:19,960
don't know to answer and save identity

1257
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,849
you asking the wrong person I believe

1258
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,280
that it's much more much more

1259
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:27,819
complicated than working with ability T

1260
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:30,360
it's known that CBD and then the Rafa

1261
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:35,440
showed in the morning in the GTHA

1262
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:39,309
patient CBD alone can reduce the

1263
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:43,289
activity of the immune system right but

1264
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:43,289
in the ratio between delta T CI

1265
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:53,140
okay thanks thanks for your talk there

1266
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:55,059
highlights every year I see patients and

1267
00:59:53,139 --> 00:59:56,739
recommend to patients and when I started

1268
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:59,140
after coming to one of these conferences

1269
00:59:56,739 --> 01:00:02,079
I I give my patients recommendation I

1270
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:04,598
say get a whole plant extract in this

1271
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,859
approximate ratio and what came back to

1272
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:07,979
me is there's no such thing in the

1273
01:00:05,858 --> 01:00:10,719
dispensaries as a whole plant extract

1274
01:00:07,978 --> 01:00:13,118
its combinations of different

1275
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,728
cannabinoids and different ratios so now

1276
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:17,680
I'm doing micro dosing with one to one

1277
01:00:15,728 --> 01:00:18,669
and I'm just curious and changing the

1278
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:23,618
ratios and so forth

1279
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:26,470
I'm just curious do you see any value to

1280
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:29,380
using a whole plant and having the

1281
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:31,449
patient make their own extract from a

1282
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:34,108
whole plant in order to get more

1283
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:37,088
likelihood of the enter entourage effect

1284
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:38,798
where do I stick with oils and micro

1285
01:00:37,088 --> 01:00:39,849
dose sublingually which is kind of what

1286
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:41,679
I do because I take care of a lot of

1287
01:00:39,849 --> 01:00:44,048
elderly patients and I can't and none of

1288
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:48,098
them were interested in inhalational

1289
01:00:44,048 --> 01:00:49,509
therapy so in general again I don't know

1290
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:52,210
I'm not a physician are asking about

1291
01:00:49,509 --> 01:00:55,329
patients just asking yeah I don't know I

1292
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:58,420
think you know it's a lottery you're

1293
01:00:55,329 --> 01:01:00,460
taking a very complicated can activate

1294
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:03,690
once can help not can not help and I

1295
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:06,249
understand that outside in the field

1296
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:08,920
with the patient we need to take a

1297
01:01:06,248 --> 01:01:10,419
decision and and I admire the physician

1298
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:14,858
that doing that and I think they're

1299
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:17,739
doing very right and in order to to help

1300
01:01:14,858 --> 01:01:20,558
the patient with what we have but I will

1301
01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:23,228
say something else that might be the

1302
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,910
audience here won't like I don't believe

1303
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:27,038
in that the patient need to take a

1304
01:01:24,909 --> 01:01:28,868
decision for himself and make the de

1305
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:31,479
medicine for himself I never saw a

1306
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:33,068
person getting to emergency room said to

1307
01:01:31,478 --> 01:01:35,798
the doctor leave it I know what to do

1308
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:37,239
you know and and and I didn't see any

1309
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:41,469
patient

1310
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:44,409
lying down with no way things to his

1311
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:46,449
veins and decide what to put inside I

1312
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:48,159
don't believe in in self curing I

1313
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:51,699
believe in physicians that learn a lot

1314
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:54,460
of years and no better to take decision

1315
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:58,029
not always right not always good a lot

1316
01:01:54,460 --> 01:02:00,880
of mistakes but better than the day that

1317
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:03,330
the patient will take for his self

1318
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:07,059
decision so I believe that even though

1319
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:08,500
you might lose pupil matters it's still

1320
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:12,519
need to be in your hands but it's

1321
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:18,789
totally my opinion here and not you know

1322
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:22,599
I can't see if there is me I got it I

1323
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:25,329
got um the blue me again the

1324
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:27,309
endocannabinoid system is it taught in

1325
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:31,779
Israeli medical schools because it's not

1326
01:02:27,309 --> 01:02:34,360
taught in most medical schools here so

1327
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:37,720
it's a complicate an sir we have in

1328
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:43,780
Israel already courses for physicians

1329
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:46,059
nurses pharmacists there is more than I

1330
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:48,820
think eight courses part of them is part

1331
01:02:46,059 --> 01:02:53,529
of the Ministry of Health out of them is

1332
01:02:48,820 --> 01:03:01,480
they through the universities itself in

1333
01:02:53,530 --> 01:03:04,900
the main courses for medical school I'm

1334
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:07,269
not sure we have I think you'll see

1335
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:09,760
where you have started right so your

1336
01:03:07,269 --> 01:03:15,320

1337
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:17,540

1338
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,920
