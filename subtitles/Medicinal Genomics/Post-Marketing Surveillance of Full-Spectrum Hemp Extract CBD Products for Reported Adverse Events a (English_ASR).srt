1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,838
hello

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,019
um are your brains tapped

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,519
pretty full yeah I would imagine uh so

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,620
whoever's after me I will be taking

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,480
about 20 minutes so we're running

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:16,919
probably 10 minutes late so you've got

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,359
some time

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,760
um so let me tell you a quick story

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,320
about this this is a paper that we just

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,118
submitted

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,260
um that I have to say quite honestly I

12
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,839
have never

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,760
got so much pushback from reviewers and

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,479
and you'll see why in a second but

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,539
there's also a reason here that uh that

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,519
I'm presenting this data so just FYI I

17
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,439
am not a employee of Charlotte's Web I'm

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,899
going to talk about Charlotte's Web

19
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,299
products but essentially what we did is

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,520
this surveillance of their products I

21
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,319
have to commend Charlotte's Web for

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,420
actually doing the right thing and

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,939
really getting involved with trying to

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,160
create more of a safety database

25
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,378
so here's where we're going to go today

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,759
we're going to start with what I call

27
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:02,939
the problem

28
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:06,780
we'll go to the methods we use to help

29
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,500
add to data to solve the problem

30
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,118
um

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,060
we'll talk about the data we'll talk

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:15,118
about the AES the actual Adverse Events

33
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,100
and then we will go into this serious

34
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,040
Adverse Events and then finally we'll

35
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,539
talk about the limitations of everything

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,118
we've done here

37
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,000
okay so safety data

38
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,840
right so we've got some clinical trials

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,359
um that's great but clinical trials can

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,880
often be a group of people that don't

41
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,618
necessarily represent the population

42
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,578
so we've got to we we need more safety

43
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:43,560
data

44
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,199
my feeling in general for all

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,640
cannabinoids and this could this method

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,420
that I'm going to talk about could apply

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,359
to all cannabinoids and there's also a

48
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,640
huge barrier for research cbd's relaxed

49
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,280
a little bit but because of schedule one

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,519
there's so many I mean I remember what I

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,359
had to do to just get a CB1 antagonist

52
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:09,500
when I was doing laboratory work it was

53
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,500
uh a bit onerous

54
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,500
um so again Charlotte's Web has made

55
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,179
this data available and essentially I

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,318
took the data and did what I could with

57
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,360
it

58
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,419
okay so let's talk about methods we used

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,379
so first and this may seem like a simple

60
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:28,679
method but it's actually uh per uh FDA

61
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:31,679
regulation there's a phone number on the

62
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,900
these um oh I thought I had a

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,819
the animation there anyway there's a

64
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,159
phone number uh here at the bottom of

65
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,780
this label that points out where you can

66
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,219
get a hold of somebody if you're having

67
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,439
some sort of an issue with the product

68
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,000
that's a really important piece and

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,579
that's often something that's not done

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,159
in the Cannabis industry unfortunately

71
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,080
so if you want to call and put it talk

72
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,359
about an adverse event you've got that

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,700
option

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,720
now we put together a database in the

75
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:07,139
database we followed industry standards

76
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:08,959
based on the CPC cpsc the EPA and the

77
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,000
FDA

78
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,580
unfortunately what this database doesn't

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,039
include is is it includes some patient

80
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,440
demographics but not a lot of it and

81
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,120
it's not designed to collect the

82
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,759
specific reason why the consumer used

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,439
the product although sometimes uh show

84
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,280
this web and their system was able to

85
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,280
pick up that reason

86
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,560
okay so

87
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:36,780
safety call is a group out of I think

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,219
they're in Jersey either somewhere on

89
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,939
the East Coast

90
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:43,739
and they have set up a really excellent

91
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:46,139
surveillance program for all of Industry

92
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,780
so whether you're using bug spray or

93
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,059
you're using CBD products or you're

94
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,299
using a dietary supplement safety call

95
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,060
has got a service that allows you to

96
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,099
track any sort of Adverse Events

97
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,840
and this is the scheme they use and I'll

98
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,419
go through each step of this phase one

99
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,400
phase two and phase three

100
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,039
so phase one let's talk about that so

101
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,260
intake and documentation

102
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:14,280
um so you get a narrative of the product

103
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:16,019
used in reported adverse effects on this

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,060
um and you're looking for accurate

105
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,459
identification of products or active

106
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,860
ingredients and I have to say that you

107
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,319
look at a lot of published studies on

108
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,819
herbal medicines in general and their

109
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:32,040
Adverse Events and or their case studies

110
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,259
where there was an issue and they never

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,900
characterized the product so we we don't

112
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,939
even know if it's a really the right

113
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,258
product that we're talking about or if

114
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:43,379
it actually had the right ingredients

115
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,660
that it it claimed it had

116
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:47,819
um also we got we did pick up some of

117
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,180
the demographics as I mentioned

118
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,860
but often not everything and then we

119
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,019
looked at circumstances and time course

120
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,819
of exposure

121
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,579
and then finally specific adverse

122
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,560
effects experienced and sufficient

123
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,139
symptom characterization to be able to

124
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,439
categorize it is this real is it

125
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:11,418
something we need to pursue further

126
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,418
um phase two what was done here

127
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:19,198
is essentially a follow-up of phase one

128
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,419
incidents so

129
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,240
detailed information was collected

130
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:26,339
regarding the most recent exposure the

131
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
history of exposure

132
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,119
um the details of the adverse symptoms

133
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,579
treatment of the adverse symptoms if

134
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,220
there was any treatment brief but

135
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:38,459
relevant medical and Drug history if

136
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,100
they could gather that sometimes it they

137
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:44,038
couldn't and then if subjects received

138
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,639
Medical Treatments medical records were

139
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,800
obtained sometimes now all of this seems

140
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,180
rather nebulous because you're dealing

141
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,220
with consumers you're not dealing with

142
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,660
somebody that's in a hospital so you get

143
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,460
what you can from them and sometimes

144
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,520
they refuse to answer or sometimes they

145
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,138
don't know or sometimes there's a it's

146
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,899
an email chain and there's just not

147
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,639
enough data there

148
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:07,379
phase three is where the rubber hits the

149
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,478
road and you actually get a healthcare

150
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:12,779
provider a physician experienced an

151
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:15,060
adverse drug events involved so they

152
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,379
look at temporality they look at

153
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,660
biological physiological or

154
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:20,519
pharmacological plausibility and they

155
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,199
look at alternative causes that could

156
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,818
have happened

157
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,460
um and so that's really how this whole

158
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:29,039
system was set up

159
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,599
and then further in phase three uh d

160
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,240
challenge did the product exposure

161
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,699
withdrawal result in amelioration or

162
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,699
elimination of the symptoms or reported

163
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,199
effects and then the re-challenge did a

164
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,939
re-challenge occur and I have to say

165
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,379
when we get to the saes they're going to

166
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,839
be disappointed because a lot of times

167
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,339
this wasn't done but I'll go through

168
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,318
them nevertheless

169
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,239
and then after the review

170
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,000
what's the opinion

171
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,280
was it real

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,199
so

173
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,439
the seriousness and need for follow-up

174
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,500
this is that last slide phase three

175
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:07,740
is done by a board-certified position

176
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,019
in a case meets the the serious adverse

177
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,060
event criteria safety cough repair is

178
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,159
the appropriate midwatch form and then

179
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,180
reports that

180
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,680
now this is a period of 18 months and it

181
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,699
also gives you an idea of Charlotte's

182
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,300
Web sales but it's a period of 18 months

183
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,978
and this is what was used to grade the

184
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,740
Adverse Events and this is a typical

185
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:33,060
this is not

186
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,579
cannabinoid friendly this is just what

187
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,800
is used in the industry to grade Adverse

188
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,680
Events so grade one is considered very

189
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,680
mild you get to grade three it's more

190
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,860
severe you get the grade five well you

191
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,860
died

192
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:51,478
uh now the dose range now what

193
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:53,519
Charlotte's Web has determined is that

194
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,800
they've got about a 1.4 milligram per

195
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,978
kilogram of CBD average daily

196
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,598
consumption and I'd love to hear

197
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,818
comments from the Physicians as we as we

198
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:06,360
get to the end of this but

199
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:08,819
um it's it's uh it seems on the low end

200
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,740
to me but uh maybe maybe that's just my

201
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,539
naivete

202
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,098
um certain suggestions vary by product

203
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,318
with the highest recommended serving

204
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:17,339
size of about 30 milligrams three times

205
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,960
a day so now you're getting 90

206
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,758
milligrams

207
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,000
um

208
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,439
and then the results what we found was

209
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,538
there were about two million product

210
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,959
sales now

211
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:33,000
product sales is what we had to use to

212
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:37,079
be able to establish any sort of

213
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,940
Statistics or at least numbers and I

214
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,560
realize there's a huge limitation here

215
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,099
we'll talk about that limitation in a

216
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,139
second but it one product per house was

217
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,240
really one person using it or multiple

218
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,039
people using it so it's just hard to

219
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,500
know based on product sales but that's

220
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,480
what we've got right you just can't know

221
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,220
when something's out there now there's a

222
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,720
history of using product sales with

223
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,420
other data such as some of the hair

224
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,940
sprays and bug sprays and that sort of

225
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,860
thing so you know we used what we could

226
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,019
we had to back it up with past

227
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,778
experience and in fact there was past

228
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:15,778
experience where they used product sales

229
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:19,919
the number of AES not serious A's but

230
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:22,259
AES was 431 during this period now if

231
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,059
you if we correlate that and like I said

232
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,819
we can't really do that but if you were

233
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,619
to say roughly 2 million people were

234
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,440
using the product

235
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:35,580
and there were 431 AES well that's about

236
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,000
0.022 percent

237
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:42,060
AES per unit sold

238
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,659
again it's a weak number but it is a

239
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:48,479
start now SAE occurrence was about point

240
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,799
zero zero zero three six percent per

241
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,440
unit sold

242
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,439
so again it gives us some data

243
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,039
um seven serious AES were categorized in

244
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,279
this time

245
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,639
of the AES 98.4 percent were classified

246
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,639
as non-serious

247
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,679
now here's a summary of the Adverse

248
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,778
Events I don't by any means stretch the

249
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,338
imagination I don't expect you to be

250
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,419
able to read this but we'll pull it out

251
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,899
for you

252
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:21,059
and so what we see is gastro effects

253
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,839
gastrointestinal effects were the most

254
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:27,419
common nausea about 25 people

255
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,180
um General gastrointestinal symptoms

256
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:32,759
about 16 abdominal discomfort about 11

257
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:36,838
people and or

258
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,759
products sold and diarrhea about 10.

259
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,980
and then if we look at the central

260
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,278
nervous system headache was common

261
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,320
dizziness common for Adverse Events that

262
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,958
is this is really a very small

263
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,720
percentage but headaches dizziness and

264
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,879
seizures and then if we look at the

265
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,660
central

266
00:10:52,879 --> 00:11:01,100
psych affects anxiety in about 23 users

267
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:03,240
in insomnia in about 13 users

268
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,519
and so

269
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,100
there's our numbers if you look at

270
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,339
serious Adverse Events and we can use

271
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,500
per unit sold we could see about 0.36

272
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,000
saes per 100

273
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,019
000 units

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,940
I'd say that's pretty good

275
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:24,299
so in terms of the essays there were two

276
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,740
GI issues two neuro two psych and one

277
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:28,439
ocular

278
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,620
and you all go through these and you can

279
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,660
help you can help me determine if you

280
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,220
think they're real but I I have an

281
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,559
opinion

282
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,800
okay so let's look at this one 35 year

283
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,899
old uh using Charlotte's Web uh hemp

284
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,539
extract which is about 17 milligrams per

285
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:48,360
ml for about 45 days for anxiety and

286
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,939
depression the dose was unclear she was

287
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,700
titrating up to 40 milligrams a day well

288
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,839
we really don't know from there

289
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,360
unspecified Pharmaceuticals so there

290
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,459
were Pharmaceuticals on board as well

291
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,919
uh and then this person developed

292
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:04,379
agitation chills night sweats insomnia

293
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,559
and loss of appetite and then into a

294
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:09,600
fever stop the CBD went to the energy

295
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,559
care center and was advised to go to the

296
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,079
ER

297
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,819
if his fever didn't resolve his fever

298
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,120
continued for approximately 78 more

299
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,920
seven to eight more days and he began to

300
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,339
experience headaches nausea and vomiting

301
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,338
with blood

302
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:28,078
he presented to the ER blood and urine

303
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,639
no specific diagnosis was made released

304
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:34,039
Tom with instructions to follow up with

305
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:37,860
his PCP symptoms resolved within 10 days

306
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:40,078
and that's what we've got uh did he stop

307
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,959
the CBD we don't know did he continue

308
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,599
you know that's what we've got

309
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,819
um so uh it sounds like the stomach flu

310
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,420
I mean

311
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,060
right okay so SAE two

312
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:56,519
grade three 79 year old female who began

313
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:59,159
using Charlotte's Web original formula

314
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,839
that's about 50 milligrams per ml 25

315
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:03,240
milligrams per meal three to four times

316
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,980
daily and then she escalated the dose we

317
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,419
don't know what kind of dose escalation

318
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,560
she did unfortunately

319
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:13,139
approximately one month after starting

320
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,458
the product increase the dose and

321
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,159
continue dosing three to four times

322
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,419
daily for a month she deseed using the

323
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,879
product because she was no longer

324
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:23,159
experiencing pain

325
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,899
okay and then one month later she

326
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,778
resumed taking an unspecified amount of

327
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,639
the product to help with sleep

328
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:31,559
well at this point she developed nausea

329
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,879
vomiting and diarrhea and reported to

330
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,599
the ER where she was treated for

331
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:39,958
dehydration with IV fluids and in that

332
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,399
nausea medication through her IV line

333
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,199
um

334
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,940
so the ER doctor thought or Simpsons

335
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
were due to food poisoning and if she

336
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,839
was and she was released the same day

337
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,699
three days later she took another

338
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,959
unspecified dose of the product to help

339
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,980
with sleep and again got sick she

340
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,518
discontinued using the product at this

341
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,259
time now if this is accurate it sounds

342
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,600
likely that this could have been an

343
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:06,439
actual event however there's a lot that

344
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,440
we don't know here

345
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,620
oh and her back pain returned the

346
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,199
following month so she began using an

347
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,740
unspecified dose of CBD and smaller

348
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,079
doses again develop nausea vomiting and

349
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,480
diarrhea so now we've got three two or

350
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:25,019
three re-challenges here so

351
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,759
um it does look like a likely uh

352
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,120
SAE

353
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,500
now another essay 41 year old females as

354
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,459
an aggravation of her pre-existing

355
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,458
seizure disorder

356
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,419
um the dose was unknown and buried again

357
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,459
your ER doctor thought our symptoms were

358
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,838
due to food poisoning and she was

359
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,638
released the same day I think I must

360
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,220
have a slide mixed up here

361
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,379
uh her past medical history unspecified

362
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,079
brain surgery over 10 years yeah there

363
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,879
was a juggling of things here I don't

364
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,500
know how this happened

365
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,480
um she reported that the number of her

366
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,519
normal seizures decreased from 30 to 40

367
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,699
per month to about eight per month while

368
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,698
using the product over five years

369
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:07,259
after five years of use she gets a

370
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:10,278
sudden increase

371
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:10,278
in her seizures

372
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:20,360
so what what was that one was it

373
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,359
there's just not a lot of information

374
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,940
okay 80 year old

375
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:29,220
using Charlotte's Web original formula

376
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,339
again 50 milligrams per ml times four

377
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,560
years for nerve pain

378
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,240
so she increased her dose and shortly

379
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,059
after she increased her dose she became

380
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,500
lightheaded and Confused Her speech was

381
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,958
slurred in her eyes wooden folks now

382
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,320
this is four years in

383
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:49,439
she presented to the ER CT scan was

384
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,660
negative Doc suggested a TIA the

385
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,440
symptoms subsided within 30 minutes and

386
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,939
she was released to return home

387
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,380
approximately two months later she

388
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,279
developed the same symptoms and went to

389
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:01,980
the ER

390
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,799
the symptoms subsided within 30 minutes

391
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,240
CT scan with normal admitted to the

392
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,698
hospital until she may have had another

393
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,860
Tia if she had a TIA in the first place

394
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:13,319
she was released the next day with the

395
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,300
recommendation of follow-up with her PCP

396
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,220
she called her up with her PCP and her

397
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:19,859
neurologist

398
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,778
and the PCP stated there was probably an

399
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,820
interaction between her gabapentin and

400
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:26,220
the THC and the hemp product which

401
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,720
probably is unlikely if you really look

402
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,720
at the data with Gabapentin

403
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,958
the CBD and her Gabapentin dose was

404
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:38,639
decreased by 50 percent

405
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,958
now this one is interesting as well and

406
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,079
this is a disruptive mood just

407
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:45,299
regulation nine-year-old female her dose

408
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:49,278
she was using 17 milligrams at night and

409
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:52,258
seven seven milligrams during the day

410
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,879
and would we what do we see here she

411
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,800
gave her daughter the the mother gave

412
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,019
the daughter the 17 milligram product at

413
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,359
night the following even evening no

414
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:04,019
product was used okay so she's got about

415
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,179
24 hours here the next morning now we're

416
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:08,220
at 36 hours roughly the next morning the

417
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,620
child's mother gave the gives the child

418
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,298
the seven milligram product within a few

419
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,519
hours the child began to exhibit

420
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:16,558
behavioral changes she was given another

421
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,078
dose of the seven milligram milligram

422
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,000
product in the afternoon

423
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:22,259
child then became angry punched her

424
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,619
mother and her mother's boyfriend and

425
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:26,939
began yelling suicidal statements

426
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,279
sounds like a good strategy to get

427
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,880
attention right

428
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,678
um

429
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,840
there's no information on what

430
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,940
psychiatric medications this patient was

431
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,619
on or if these medications were abruptly

432
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,600
ceased and replaced with the CBD product

433
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:42,779
so we really don't know much here so

434
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,259
it's hard to pin this to the product

435
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,259
itself

436
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,599
now here's another one another psych

437
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,940
eight-year-old female using original

438
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,058
formula hip extract oil for autism

439
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,179
spectrum disorder dose is 25 milligrams

440
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:59,038
by mouth once to twice daily

441
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,380
each time the child received the product

442
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,599
she acted out and cried briefly

443
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,220
day four usual dose in the morning and

444
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,959
went to school

445
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,240
the school nurse called the report child

446
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,679
was having a seizure vomiting drooling

447
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,859
staring into space and with their eyes

448
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,240
rolled back in her head intermittently

449
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:17,699
non-responsive transported to the ER by

450
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,120
ambulance where she was responsive upon

451
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,120
arrival

452
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,719
the treating physician agreed that she

453
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,220
experienced a seizure he did not think

454
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,500
the product contributed to her symptoms

455
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,538
no treatment was given she was released

456
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,259
after approximately five hours and she

457
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:35,759
was asymptomatic upon release

458
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:37,879
remained asymptomatic one week later at

459
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:41,240
the time of the report did she continue

460
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,240
we don't know

461
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,759
okay uh and then the last one 70 year 73

462
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,860
year old female dose of 30 milligrams uh

463
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,900
daily hemp oil extract for arthritis

464
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:56,399
pain

465
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,940
uh three weeks after starting the

466
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,740
product developed changes in her vision

467
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,179
movement or Vision at a lower part of

468
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,538
her right eye when nothing was there

469
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:09,080
flashing lights and steady lights

470
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:12,359
diagnosed with ischemic optic neuropathy

471
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:15,240
they deseed the product and return for a

472
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:18,479
follow-up she was on steroid eye drops

473
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,859
as a treatment nine days later returned

474
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,740
to our ophthalmologist for depth

475
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:24,178
perception and visual field test with no

476
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,880
significant change

477
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,679
two months later had a 20 Improvement in

478
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,059
her vision and the ophthalmologist and

479
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,120
the PCP gave her permission to start

480
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,678
using a CP CBD again and one month after

481
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,058
restarting the product reported that she

482
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,798
believed her vision was continuing to

483
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:39,960
approve but she had not yet had another

484
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:40,918
test to confirm this

485
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,538
um

486
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,759
I don't know it doesn't sound very

487
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:46,500
likely

488
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,419
now

489
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,419
um previously documented AE so let's

490
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:53,360
look at the epidiolex study and here's

491
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,480
what we've got we've got samulence at 25

492
00:19:53,359 --> 00:20:00,899
of of the AES not 25 of people but 25 of

493
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,419
the AES a decreased appetite uh 22

494
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,059
diarrhea 20

495
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:08,759
elevated transaminase is about 16 now

496
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:11,399
fatigue malays asthenia about 12 percent

497
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:15,359
at lethargy lethargy excuse me eight

498
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,880
percent and convulsions about 11 percent

499
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,099
and these doses are about tenfold higher

500
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,380
than is typically used by Charlotte's

501
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:25,740
Web uh consumers

502
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,200
so let's compare these comparison of A's

503
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,940
on one side we've got the postmark and

504
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,160
surveillance done with these lower dose

505
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,798
products Charles Webb's products on the

506
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,259
other end we've got the epidialyte

507
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:40,619
clinical trials and you do see a

508
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:41,220
commonality in terms of gastrointestinal

509
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,159
um

510
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,160
but other than that the fatigue and

511
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:50,779
malays uh a little bit there but if you

512
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,279
consider nausea but really uh

513
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:56,720
not a lot of correlations let's talk

514
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,720
about limitations of this data

515
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:04,019
multiple reliable methods to collect AES

516
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:05,779
so some of the AES

517
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,859
spontaneous reporting through National

518
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:09,480
pharmacovigilance databases collecting

519
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:11,759
practice data soliciting events from

520
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,919
Healthcare professionals they all have

521
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,179
their weaknesses direct observation so

522
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,460
they've all got weaknesses they've all

523
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:20,100
got strengths so surveying patients

524
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,798
obviously has some weaknesses but this

525
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:25,980
provides a starting point

526
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,019
um for this sort of work and it is

527
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,839
sub-optimal data collection we've been

528
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,460
great to have seen more stuff here so

529
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,038
confounding factors we could have had

530
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,079
here underlying medical conditions

531
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,798
obviously prescription medications

532
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:43,139
obviously dietary changes so biological

533
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,579
variability life stressors or they're

534
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,520
all uh

535
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:49,740
considerable

536
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:52,319
and also just correlating units to

537
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,000
people is very very difficult so I'm

538
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,240
getting told I need to get off the stage

539
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,819
here so I am going to jump to my last

540
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,940
slide here

541
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,439
and what I'd like to point out is

542
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,200
let's

543
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,240
as an industry let's support this sort

544
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,340
of work and as an industry if you're

545
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,259
running a company this is a really good

546
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:16,558
chance for you to actually add to the

547
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,599
database it is considered not as strong

548
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:22,500
as clinical trials but it is regular

549
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:24,899
data and FDA and uh European medicine

550
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,599
Agency use this sort of data to make

551
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,120
decisions it's consumer reported data to

552
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:33,959
make decisions about about safety so I'd

553
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:36,658
really encourage you to consider

554
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,519
stepping up to the plate and and doing

555
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,600
more of this sort of thing especially if

556
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:41,359
we could do this with some of the other

557
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,699
cannabinoids CBG

558
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,379
thcv it'd be a huge plus to the safety

559
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,700
data

560
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,420
that's it thank you

561
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,420
[Laughter]
