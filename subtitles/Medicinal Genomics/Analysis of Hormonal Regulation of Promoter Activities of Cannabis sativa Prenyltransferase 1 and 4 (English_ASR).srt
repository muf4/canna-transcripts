00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,339
hi everybody Welcome today to my talk my

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,980
name is Lauren Sands I am a senior

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,379
technician at safe Diva labs in

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,120
Westfield Massachusetts but today I'm

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,219
actually presenting on my grad school

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,679
work that I was so lucky to conduct at

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,599
the University of Connecticut under Dr

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,339
Gerald Berkowitz

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,340
I don't have the clicker

10
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:38,280
and as said the title of my talk is the

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,379
analysis of hormonal regulation of

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,799
promoter activities of Cannabis sativa

13
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:46,979
Primal transferase 1 and 4.

14
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,859
so the research goals for this my grad

15
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,718
school work was to one develop a better

16
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,320
understanding of the enzymes that

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,899
produce cannabidrolic acid cbga in terms

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,079
of functionality location and importance

19
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,820
in Cannabis sativa and in addition we

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,099
wanted to conduct studies involving

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,019
hormone treatments to gather information

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,938
regarding which hormone signaling

23
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,819
pathways are actually involved in

24
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,978
cannabinoid production

25
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,719
so cannabinoids are obviously produced

26
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,879
in trichomes and there's different types

27
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,920
of trichomes on the cannabis plant but

28
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:23,280
we're specifically interested in the

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,140
glandular stock trichome these are small

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,900
hair like projections that are made up

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,659
of stock and head tissue most commonly

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,700
found on leaves and flowers on cannabis

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,618
plants and of course on unpollinated

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,140
female flowers

35
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,700
these trichomes are the cannabinoid and

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,219
terpene factories that we're also

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,500
interested in so the center image you

38
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,840
can see a quick little diagram of this

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,938
trichome you can see the base of a stalk

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,759
and at the top the secretory vesicles

41
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,859
and cells the top this base this is what

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,140
we're interested in

43
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,420
so as I said we're interested in this

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,579
head of the glandular trichome

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,978
this contains the cannabinoids and the

46
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,199
enzymes producing them the enzyme that I

47
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,938
mentioned that produces cbga this is the

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,539
one we're interested in

49
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:12,180
so you can you can see on the left a

50
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,259
structural diagram up close this shows

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,300
the different parts of the head of the

52
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,639
glandular trichome and then on the right

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,620
you can actually see the cannabinoid

54
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,039
biosynthetic pathway

55
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,780
written out showing you the top the top

56
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,479
on the right of this cannabinoid

57
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,759
biosynthetic pathway shows you the

58
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,439
plastid and you can see in blue it's

59
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,419
connected to the diagram on the left

60
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,939
this shows the rosette of gland cells

61
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,579
this is the bottom of the head of the

62
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:41,579
glandular trichome so this contains the

63
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,680
enzymes that produce cbga and cbgas

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,019
actually produced in the rosette at the

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,900
base and it is exported to the secretory

66
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:52,019
reservoir which you can see in red this

67
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,539
is indicated on the left and right so

68
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,080
you can see CBJ is produced in the base

69
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,939
exported to the reservoir and we're

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,560
trying to figure out why the enzyme is

71
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,139
making cbga

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,780
and you can see the star

73
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,639
this star indicates the cbga synthase

74
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,519
enzyme

75
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,079
cbga synthase has been referred to as

76
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,319
many different things in literature it's

77
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,420
been referred to as cbga synthase or got

78
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,199
general diphosphate olivotolate

79
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:26,399
transferase or in my case pt4 penal

80
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:28,500
transferase4 so we

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,239
were just really interested in this cbga

82
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,000
synthase enzyme and we're going to get

83
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,939
more into that now

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,219
so the main reason why our lab decided

85
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,579
to focus on this prenal transferase

86
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:45,479
enzyme cbga synthase it's because we

87
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,719
initially did a research study over the

88
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,119
course of a flower flowering period

89
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,580
we took

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,400
we took the flowers and we measured cbga

91
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,140
synthase in this case pt4 we measured

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,140
this gene expression over the course of

93
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,759
the flowering period as well as we took

94
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,339
the cannabinoid content and we measured

95
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:09,479
the cbga in the plant we saw at week

96
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:12,000
four cbj's peaking and at week four this

97
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,679
pt4 gene expression level it's peaking

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,339
as well and then you can see a positive

99
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,298
correlation increases then decreases and

100
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,339
then

101
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:25,500
you can see on the right we also did

102
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:28,079
this with thca and thca synthase we saw

103
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,240
that thca contents peaking at week six

104
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,478
but there's no positive correlation with

105
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,620
thca synthase so we wanted to put less

106
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:39,599
focus on this thca since enzyme and more

107
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,240
focus on the prenal transferase genes

108
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,580
and these precursor enzymes so we want

109
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,019
to understand cannabinoid synthesis look

110
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:47,758
at the enzyme that's producing the

111
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,859
cannabinoid that's needed for conversion

112
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,560
towards endpoint cannabinoid synthesis

113
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,840
and as we know cbga is the mother of all

114
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,079
cannabinoids

115
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,079
foreign

116
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:04,978
these are membrane-bound enzymes

117
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,740
localized to plant plastids and in

118
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:10,079
cannabis we've identified 10 of them

119
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,319
and literature has actually pointed to

120
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,439
the fact that pt4 this is the main cbga

121
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,779
synthase enzyme however all some papers

122
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,719
have reference that pt1 is capable of

123
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:24,059
producing cbga specifically in a patent

124
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,320
done by Jonathan Page and his group in

125
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,759
2011.

126
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,918
so

127
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,538
there are there's a lot of research

128
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:37,258
literature review showing that is it pt1

129
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:39,360
or is it pt4 so both have shown cbga

130
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:42,240
synthesis capability however yeast

131
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,819
assays have revealed that pt4's only

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,180
substrate is all of atolic acid

133
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,219
but pt1 is promiscuous so pt1 is able to

134
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,680
work with different substrates all of

135
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,820
italic acid all of it all narengine Etc

136
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,340
pt1's affinity for this substrate

137
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:02,279
ovatoic acid was shown to be

138
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:05,279
sorry P2 almost 60 millimolar well pt4

139
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:08,279
was 6.27 micromolar so this is the

140
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,198
affinity for this substrate so pt4 was

141
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,418
shown to have a 10 000

142
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,400
stronger affinity for this substrate

143
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:18,478
elevatoric acid

144
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:21,779
and lastly when put into this yeast

145
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,120
system and when pt4 and pt1 were put

146
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,359
into the yeast systems and fed all of

147
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,340
italic acid it was shown that pt4 invert

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,639
in a variety of studies pt4 was

149
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:36,179
producing this cbga while pt1 was

150
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,939
showing little to no production of cbga

151
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,819
so while literature points to pt4 being

152
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,860
the main cbda synthase enzyme we figured

153
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:47,780
with all this literature maybe let's

154
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,780
just look at both renal transferases

155
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:52,439
and to understand why these perennial

156
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,918
transferase genes that produce the

157
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:58,740
enzymes are producing cbga we decided to

158
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,359
look at their promoters so promoters are

159
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,000
the sequence Upstream of the

160
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,939
transcription start site that regulate

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,019
DNA transcription and basically tell the

162
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:13,740
gene whether to turn on turn off not

163
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,959
work at all and so these promoters have

164
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,900
responsive elements throughout the

165
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,459
region and

166
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:22,258
promoters can be anywhere from five

167
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,418
thousand to two thousand base pairs

168
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,000
upwards of that and throughout these

169
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:29,698
regions there's responsive elements that

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,279
respond to various stimuli so stimuli

171
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,520
such as hormones specific transcription

172
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,258
Factor families and more so these

173
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,478
regions are actually highly conserved

174
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,160
across promoters so it's really nice you

175
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,060
can look at other organisms in these

176
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,979
databases such as place and plant care

177
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:50,579
to see if maybe your promoter also has

178
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:52,258
these responsive elements and maybe they

179
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:53,699
also respond to these diff specific

180
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,319
stimuli

181
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,240
and um

182
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,220
yeah if they're responsive to these

183
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,060
stimuli this can activate an increase

184
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,039
expression or repress the expression

185
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,079
so while there's all these different

186
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,818
responsive elements that are contained

187
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,500
in the promoter we decided to focus

188
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,500
solely on hormones

189
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,360
and hormones are chemicals produced by

190
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,360
plants that regulate their growth

191
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,360
development reproductive processes

192
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,520
Etc and actually hormones are known to

193
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,500
be super involved in flowering in

194
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,740
different plants especially it's been

195
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,259
shown in hops so we've decided to focus

196
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,060
on this because hormones are definitely

197
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,479
involved in secondary metabolite

198
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,519
production and plants likely in cannabis

199
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,560
there have been too many studies on it

200
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,478
but it's pretty clear that they're

201
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,599
involved in secondary metabolite

202
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,100
production and cannabis

203
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,040
so these hormone responsive elements

204
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,159
they are long stretches of DNA that are

205
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,559
going to bind to proteins that are

206
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,419
activated as these hormones are released

207
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,059
in the plant as the hormone signaling

208
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:03,958
Pathways get active

209
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:05,579
and so these hormones shown on the slide

210
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,079
of course there's many more in Plants

211
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,620
these are the ones that we focused on

212
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,200
for our studies and so we use these

213
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,120
databases and these are the um these are

214
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,700
the hormones that we discovered are

215
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,519
likely responsive in our promoters of

216
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,480
penal transferase one and four so we

217
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,080
have ethylene abscisic acid gibberellin

218
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,659
cytokinin salicylic acid and oxen

219
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,899
and um we predict that these hormones

220
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:35,039
not only a few of them are

221
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,659
interacting with these perennial

222
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,458
transfers promoters we predict that

223
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:41,159
they're all working together in this

224
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:43,819
orchestra that is cannabinoid synthesis

225
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,819
in the plants

226
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,979
so we were able to clone the 600 base

227
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:52,860
pairs Upstream of the prenal transferase

228
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,080
for transcription start site shown here

229
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,959
on the screen

230
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,940
we identified this using ncbi and of

231
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:03,119
course the responsive element databases

232
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,880
provided us with these hormones for

233
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,159
penal transferase Forest promoter so

234
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,139
these hormones some of them might

235
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,778
activate the promoter some might not

236
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,000
they might work synergistically

237
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:16,080
antagonistically or not at all so we

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,899
were actually able to clone this

239
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,160
promoter and we used it to examine the

240
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,278
hormone of

241
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,139
we used it to examine sorry

242
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,899
to examine the effects of hormone

243
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:30,838
treatment on the promoters as well as a

244
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,179
variety of assays for promoter activity

245
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,200
localization in cannabis plants using

246
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,199
Gus assays

247
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,300
and we were also able to do this with

248
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,278
prenal transferase one we were actually

249
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:48,479
able to clone more of the promoter of

250
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:50,578
this Gene we got 1500 base pairs you can

251
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,079
see on this screen there's a little bit

252
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:55,739
more responsive elements we have

253
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:58,879
gibberellin salicylic acid auxin and

254
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,879
abscisic acid

255
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:07,019
so we were able to clone these promoters

256
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:10,200
from genomic DNA from Cannabis sativa

257
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:13,320
hemp in our lab at UConn we cloned them

258
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,040
and we inserted them into vectors either

259
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,260
tagged with luciferase or Gus reporters

260
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:22,379
so these constructs with our promoters

261
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:26,220
were utilized in duluciferase assays or

262
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:28,679
gas assays so luciferase assay's report

263
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,440
luciferase reporter assays investigate

264
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,939
whether stimuli can activate or refresh

265
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,940
transcription

266
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,740
using the Gene luciferase and Gus essays

267
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,959
are used for localization and the

268
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,000
functional gush Gene that's produced can

269
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,458
it makes blue coloration in the plant

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,200
upon integration to the plant hormone

271
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,199
plant genome sorry

272
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,620
so first we wanted to confirm the

273
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,419
location of the greatest activity of

274
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,000
prenal transferase genes and promoters

275
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,578
in the plant on the left you can see we

276
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,679
performed quantitative PCR on our

277
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:04,199
flowering plants in the sixth week of

278
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,179
flowering and we saw that the MRNA

279
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,560
expression levels of both prenal

280
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:12,299
transferase 1 and 4 were highly the gene

281
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,338
activity was high much higher in the

282
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:17,399
flower and leaf compared to our root

283
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:20,220
control and after confirming the

284
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,320
location of genescript Gene transcript

285
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,800
location activity we wanted to visualize

286
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,339
these genes in the cannabis plants so we

287
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:32,099
used our promoter Gus constructs and we

288
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:36,660
took cannabis seedlings and sugar leaves

289
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:38,339
and we were able to visualize these

290
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:40,139
promoters in

291
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,519
in the dark blue you can see this is

292
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:45,120
where the promoters are active in the

293
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,039
plant and so you can see seedlings on

294
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,379
the left and sugar leaves on the right

295
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,819
so you can see in the sugar leaves which

296
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,578
are the leaves that form around the

297
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,519
flowers as the plant matures we saw

298
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:59,759
greater activity in the dark blue for

299
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,379
penal transfers 4 and there's actually a

300
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,838
really cool picture

301
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:06,480
this was our prenal transferase 4

302
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,519
promoter tagged with Gus you can see in

303
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,440
the sugar leaves in the dark blue and

304
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,839
the trichomes we were able to confirm

305
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,120
that our promoter was very active in

306
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,560
these regions and not only did this

307
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,899
confirm that this is where it's active

308
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,159
we also confirmed that these promoters

309
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,879
were capable of driving different

310
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,879
reporters

311
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,439
so to read the activation of our

312
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,200
promoters in vitro we utilized protoplas

313
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,060
which are cells without cell walls and

314
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,540
without these cell walls they can accept

315
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:38,819
DNA and transiently express this DNA and

316
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:41,578
so using dual luciferous assays we can

317
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,519
measure this DNA expression

318
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,899
so we enzymatically isolated protoplasts

319
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,899
and prepared them for transient

320
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,578
expression of plasmids containing peachy

321
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,578
promoters driving the luciferase

322
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:55,799
reporter overnight transfection hormone

323
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:58,439
treatments were completed following that

324
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,879
of hormones at concentrations of 10

325
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,060
micromolar

326
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,179
and we also used pop we used negative

327
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,799
and positive controls in this experiment

328
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,719
and the cells were then collected for

329
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,778
five hours following this hormone

330
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,200
treatment and the protoplasts containing

331
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:19,259
our plasmids were frozen and used in

332
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,940
further duluciferase assays and as you

333
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,278
can see on the right here this is an

334
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,740
experiment done on arabidopsis it shows

335
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,179
that the promoters are active following

336
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,759
hormone treatment

337
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,979
in the five hours post hormone treatment

338
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,759
and this is why we use these few hours

339
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,759
afterwards

340
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,199
we measured this promoter activity with

341
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:41,820
the luciferase assays as said and so in

342
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,159
this case we're investigating if our

343
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,920
stimuli this hormone can activate our

344
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,679
promoter to initiate transcription of

345
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,439
this luciferous Gene located Downstream

346
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:55,138
of this promoter so this is actually

347
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,560
using the luciferase gene found in

348
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:01,320
fireflies and in Sea pansies

349
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,539
and so their protoplasts their

350
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,240
transfection with renal transferase

351
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:09,198
Firefly luciferase constructs that's our

352
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,820
promoter of interest and we also

353
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,159
co-transfected it with a 35s

354
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,260
constitutive promoter which is tagged

355
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,179
with our vanilla elusive race

356
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:20,639
so these Frozen protoplasts that we

357
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:23,159
collected previously are lysed mixed

358
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,320
with reagents either luciferin for our

359
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:28,679
Firefly luciferase our promoters of

360
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,899
Interest or mixed with Cowell and koala

361
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,219
and Terra Zion for our vanilla

362
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,679
luciferase

363
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,560
so this reaction creates luminescence in

364
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,719
our luminometer this ratio is created

365
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,119
considered relative luminescence and

366
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,220
this to this directly correlates with

367
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,600
the activation of the promoter following

368
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,778
hormone treatment

369
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,778
foreign

370
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,399
so here are our results for prenal

371
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,380
transfers for we're presenting the

372
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,500
response towards hormones hormones that

373
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:02,039
did result in promoter activation we did

374
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,500
see some hormones that did not activate

375
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:07,078
the promoter that's all in the paper we

376
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,759
used methylgasminate this did not have a

377
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,039
hormone responsive element predicted in

378
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,919
the promoter we saw no response from

379
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,379
this so these graphs they show relative

380
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,259
luminescence the ratio created from fire

381
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:21,240
apply to vanilla luciferase in our in

382
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:24,179
our protoplasts following hormone

383
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,399
treatment so some hormones were

384
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:28,859
administered as either a synthetic

385
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,620
hormone or a precursor depending on how

386
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,919
these hormones exist in nature so

387
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:37,620
firstly exogenous ethylene administered

388
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,778
as one Amino cyclopropane one carboxylic

389
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,980
acid this is the precursor as ethylene

390
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:43,320
is gaseous

391
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,240
led to significant promoter activity

392
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,579
five hours past treatment

393
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,320
exogenous hypocisic acid led to

394
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:51,379
significant promoter activity at three

395
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,759
and five hours past treatment

396
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:55,820
exogenous gibberellin the administered

397
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,800
is gibberellic acid three led to

398
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,019
significant promoter active in

399
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:04,519
activation at hours three and five past

400
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:07,558
treatment and lastly exogenous cytokinin

401
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,879
administered as transient riboside led

402
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,578
to significant promoter activity

403
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,939
activation at hours three and five past

404
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,938
treatment

405
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,360
so we went a little bit more in depth

406
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,418
with salicylic acid's connection to

407
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,240
prenal transferase4 we predicted that

408
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:26,100
salicylic acid is likely involved or

409
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,259
very involved in cannabinoid synthesis

410
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:31,678
because salicylic acid is a plant

411
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:34,919
defense hormone and cannabinoids among

412
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,840
their many purposes they are produced to

413
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,480
play a role in defending the plant from

414
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,279
pathogens including insects fungi

415
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,980
viruses and bacteria

416
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,019
so in a previous experiment we saw an

417
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,419
increase in gene transcript levels in

418
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:50,220
Penal transferase 4 following a soil

419
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,500
drench treatment containing one

420
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,538
millimolar of salicylic acid so you can

421
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,579
see it's a very tiny graph at the bottom

422
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:59,279
we actually saw a hundred-fold increase

423
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:02,339
in Penal transferase 4 gene expression

424
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,079
three days post sa treatment so we saw

425
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:06,720
already that the gene transcript levels

426
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,699
are affected by this hormone so of

427
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,900
course we expect it to be affected in

428
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,960
the promoter

429
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,940
so we can see that cspt4 promoter was

430
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,259
activated at hours three and four past

431
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:21,840
treatment for salicylic acid and pt4

432
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:25,140
and I actually decided to perform site

433
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:27,599
Direct immunogenesis on this salicylic

434
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,460
acid responsive element in the prenal

435
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,099
transferase4 promoter

436
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,319
so I was able to create point mutations

437
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:37,500
in this response development

438
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:41,038
shown in red the red base pairs were

439
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,558
switched and I repeated this promoter

440
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:46,140
hormone treatment with this mutated

441
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,599
promoter and I then saw no response to

442
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,580
salicylic acid so we're essentially

443
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:53,219
confirming that this putative responsive

444
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:55,199
element is a Bonafide CIS acting element

445
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,460
that is involved in salicylic acid

446
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,740
signaling

447
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,120
so we think salicylic acid is a great

448
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,519
hormone to look at in the future for

449
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,500
cannabinoid synthesis and its effects on

450
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,900
that

451
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,298
so while we saw many effects from prenal

452
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,580
transferase4 we also looked at renal

453
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:14,519
transferase 1 as I mentioned we didn't

454
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:18,000
see as great responses or higher

455
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,579
responses more hormones in the response

456
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,940
of renal transferase wands promoter we

457
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:27,298
saw we did see a activation at hours one

458
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,000
three and five for salicylic acid at one

459
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:32,599
three and five for oxen and at hours

460
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,279
three pass treatment for abscystic acid

461
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:38,219
so there's different hormones affecting

462
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,079
each prenal transferase promoter there's

463
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,058
different sets of hormones affecting

464
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,798
each promoter so we're thinking maybe

465
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,899
there's different functionality in these

466
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,759
perennial transferase genes it's

467
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,700
basically it's giving a little bit more

468
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:54,000
insight into how these different

469
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,840
transverse genes act in the cannabis

470
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,380
plant

471
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:00,899
so I'll wrap this up really quickly our

472
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,179
conclusions so we think plant hormones

473
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,980
are almost certainly very involved in

474
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,080
cannabinoid synthesis and signaling

475
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,480
Pathways affecting the cannabinoid

476
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,699
biosynthetic pathway

477
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,860
the hormone networks in cannabis as seen

478
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,840
in other plants are very interconnected

479
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,579
we're seeing multiple hormones working

480
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,918
on the same promoter

481
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:22,500
there's definitely needs to be more

482
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,600
research involved in how why and when

483
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,160
hormones are produced in the cannabis

484
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,019
plant during flowering how they're

485
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,179
affecting perennial transferase genes

486
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,220
and the effects on one hormone on

487
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,019
another is really interesting so as you

488
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,240
can see again these hormones on the

489
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,579
bottom left are ones that we saw

490
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,779
response in the promoters for these

491
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:42,659
genes

492
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:44,759
both promoters respond to Celica acid

493
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,798
and the cystic acid and these hormone

494
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,900
networks and plants have been shown to

495
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,460
work together in many different plants

496
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,400
or against each other

497
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,400
and lastly we should conduct more

498
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,320
studies on these promoters and hormones

499
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,019
in the actual plant throughout flowering

500
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,359
to understand how cannabinoid synthesis

501
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,519
is actually happening and this can help

502
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,038
a lot in the future one if anybody ever

503
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:11,038
decides to do growth promoter growth

504
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:13,019
Regulators as hormones and just

505
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,179
understanding how cannabinoids are

506
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,918
produced in the plant it's really good

507
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:20,160
to get a good understanding on how it's

508
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,780
made and so then we can further

509
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,400
understand how cannabinoids are produced

510
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,160
in the plant for medical purposes

511
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,500
growing purposes and just to better

512
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,058
understand our plants

513
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,119
here's the sources for anybody

514
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:35,038
interested in them and yeah thank you

515
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,539
all thank you Cam and medicinal genomics

516
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,289
and Advanced Nutrients

517
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:40,289
[Applause]

518
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,500
a great talk Lauren um thanks I've got

519
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:48,178
uh one question on the these hormone

520
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,798
sequences that you're highlighting um

521
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,000
they're fairly short in sequence which

522
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:53,279
means if you scan the whole genome

523
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,259
you'll find them somewhat everywhere

524
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,940
um I I noticed from some previous

525
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:58,740
methylation sequencing that we've done

526
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,480
before that at least not on the parental

527
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,620
transfers for being Gene but on the GC

528
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,940
synthase genes there's all types of

529
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,158
weird methylation happening on the five

530
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,019
Prime uh promoter of that of that Gene

531
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,960
and I noticed you made a mutation up

532
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:12,480
there that introduced a cpg is it

533
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,159
possible that there's uh an epigenetic

534
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,179
component here of how these hormones are

535
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,200
are regulating these sequences

536
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,640
what's the mechanism of the sequence

537
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,319
sites is there a protein that's like

538
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,759
binding to it you think that's true in

539
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,619
the responsive elements yeah the

540
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,400
responsive elements yeah definitely I

541
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:29,459
think

542
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,679
um I think I understand your question

543
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,440
um these short DNA binding sequences

544
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,640
they're specifically somehow binding to

545
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,200
the transcription factors that are

546
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,360
activated through the hormone signaling

547
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,980
pathways

548
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,719
obviously I don't have this data with

549
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,179
the types of hormone treatments you did

550
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,100
but I can share through a bunch of

551
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:48,538
bisulfide sequencing we did on Plants

552
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,939
before and after flowering and I don't

553
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:52,140
know it might show some cpg methylation

554
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,200
that might be playing a role in those

555
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,299
signatures so I'll connect after yeah um

556
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,460
actually this data was accepted this

557
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:00,900
morning for publication so if anyone's

558
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,720
interested please check it out in

559
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,859
