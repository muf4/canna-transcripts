University of Kentucky recently

51
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,079
published a fact sheet about ferium in

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,120
hemp plants which cut my eye considering

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,640
many of the cultivators we work with at

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,120
medicinal genomics struggle with that

55
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,079
pathogen during our conversation we

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,158
discuss the financial impact of fusarium

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,159
on hemp and cannabis crops the public

58
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:47,560
health concerns due to fusarium

59
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:51,079
production of harmful mot

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,959
toxins how Growers often misidentify

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,879
ferum headlight as buritis due to

62
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,120
similar symptoms leading to ineffective

63
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,799
management

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,120
strategies Environmental conditions that

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,719
increase the likelihood of a fusarium

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,080
infection challenges for prevention and

67
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,239

90
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,800
go good afternoon Nicole thanks so much

91
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:26,800
for joining me on the podcast hello how

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,840
are you I am great and I'm excited to

93
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
talk with you today about the work that

94
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,719
you and your team are doing to better

95
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,160
understand plant pathogens pathogens

96
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,639
affecting hemp plants your team recently

97
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,720
published a fact sheet about fusarium in

98
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,400
hemp plants which we are going to dive

99
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,880
into but I know that's only one of many

100
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,959
pathogens that your team studies so

101
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,959
maybe to start can you provide a brief

102
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,279
overview of the most common diseases

103
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,399
affecting hemp crops and why did you

104
00:04:53,279 --> 00:05:01,478
decide to focus on fusarium this time

105
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:04,319
okay so um um hemp in in Kentucky most

106
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:07,680
everywhere is grown Outdoors um

107
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,599
primarily in the field so um in so when

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,280
I look at cannabis in general when I

109
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,560
look at hemp or or high THC low THC uh

110
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,918
whether it's floral or grain or Fiber um

111
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,918
we're essentially we essentially have

112
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,959
the same plant right so I look at it

113
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:26,439
from an outdoor standpoint um what what

114
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,719
pathogens can infect um then we can go

115
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,079
on the flip side and we can look at

116
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,479
indoor cannabis or indoor hemp however

117
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:36,159
you want to phrase it and an indoor um

118
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,240
environment is going to have its own set

119
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
of of pathogens because you have a very

120
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,360
different climate system so in Plant

121
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,360
Pathology uh most of our diseases are

122
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,199
driven by not just the presence of the

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,720
pathogen but also the uh the climate

124
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,840
right temperature and

125
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,639
humidity so in um in outdoor uh hemp we

126
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,799
see um stand establishment problems so

127
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,720
we can have pythium root Rod whatever

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,478
the nature of the the previous crop or

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,800
the history of that field so we can see

130
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:08,800
a lot of uh Seaborn seedling diseases

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,759
like um fusarium crowned root rot which

132
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,478
is not fusarium Wilt um so the fusarium

133
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,919
salon based Fus areia uh we can see a

134
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,758
RIS octonia crown and root rod and we

135
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:22,399
can also see some pythium root rods that

136
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,840
can affect seeds or seedlings um when we

137
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,079
get into a larger plants everybody knows

138
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,799
the leaf diseases so we have a history

139
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,038
of kind of all those Leaf diseases

140
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,680
that's what interests everyone and Leaf

141
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,639
Disease a septoria leaf spot and thos

142
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,000
circos leaf spot and then the big one

143
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,400
bipolaris leaf spot so those we've been

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,038
working on those for many years I've

145
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,120
been working on hemp since

146
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:47,399
2014 um and then when when we started

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,918
seeing this um headlight in Grain hemp

148
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,279
you know there was so much talk about

149
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:54,680
betrus um betrus grey mold and that was

150
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,679
like always the talk and so everyone was

151
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,360
seeing all of this fuzzy growth inside

152
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,120
of their their either their flower heads

153
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,439
or their seed heads they were just

154
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,598
automatically saying I've got Bettis

155
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,439
I've got Bettis and knowing that

156
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,639
pathogen because it is ubiquitous it

157
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,680
affects many different kinds of plants I

158
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,439
knew it's too hot it's too dry and so we

159
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,038
Dove a little bit deeper and that's when

160
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:20,800
we realized that we had a very

161
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,560
widespread disease and um not just the

162
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,759
blighting and so blighting is when it

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,959
kind of turns brown um not just the

164
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,080
blighting in the disease but also the

165
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,638
potential for mot toxins from those

166
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:35,198
pathogens so that kind of took us down a

167
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,960
um down a road that um you know we've

168
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,199
done a lot of work we're just starting

169
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,519
to publish that work but uh so yeah

170
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,400
we've been working with fusarium

171
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:45,598
headlight since about

172
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:48,918
2017 excellent so was I hearing that

173
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:53,199
correctly that Growers were

174
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,918
misdiagnosing bet fusarium as Bettis the

175
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,038
danger of the internet that's right the

176
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:59,598
danger of diagnosing by by symptoms and

177
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,240
pictures um so yeah it was just kind of

178
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,878
this blanket understanding that if it's

179
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,000
fuzzy and white it must be betrus and it

180
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,960
was not in fact I rarely find betrus in

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,240
the field um now I'm in I'm in a more um

182
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,839
Southern Climate than you know so we

183
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,639
could definitely see a lot more betrus

184
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,079
in the northern states but we overall

185
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,120
see betrus more in the greenhouse but

186
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,000
any of that fuzzy growth I'm seeing in

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,680
Kentucky Midwestern states midatlantic

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,560
states and definitely south of me it's

189
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,080
almost exclusively fusarium interesting

190
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,599
and how does that affect how one kind of

191
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,560
tries to manage the disease if it's one

192
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,759
or the

193
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,079
other um well both both of the pathogens

194
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,200
are true fungi so they are fungal

195
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,240
pathogens and overall they need about

196
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,440
the same temperatures and um humidity to

197
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:54,278
complete their life cycle um but trus

198
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,240
likes very high humidity um so about 85%

199
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,958
relative humidity so it's got to be very

200
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,079
wet but trius um is more of an

201
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,399
opportunity istic pathogen so when it

202
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:06,559
infects it's infecting it begins on

203
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,839
something like necrotic tissue maybe a a

204
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,199
dying leaf or something like that and so

205
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,200
it's kind of more opportunistic whereas

206
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,839
fusarium is more of a is pathogenic it's

207
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,399
highly pathogenic so it can invade a a

208
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:23,440
healthy plant versus betrus is more of

209
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,839
that kind of humidity lover and it it

210
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,399
needs a um it needs you to open the door

211
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,560
for it so it can't just like you know

212
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,679
bulldo its way into those plant cells

213
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,879
interesting all right well that's a good

214
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:38,278
segue um can you describe how ferium

215
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,559
affects hemp plants um how does it

216
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:43,360
infect and you know what is sort of the

217
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,319
progression okay well let's start with

218
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,639
uh fusarium is a genus and it's a very

219
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,560
large genus with a lot of complexes so

220
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,639
lots of species within a fusarium

221
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,958
complex so most people when they hear

222
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,120
fusarium they think of fusarium Wilt and

223
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,159
that's fusarium oxysporum different um

224
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,000
different special forms but fusarium

225
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,838
oxysporum or fusarium Wilt is a vascular

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,360
disease it starts in The Roots it's

227
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,120
allil born it moves its way up the

228
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,560
vascular system and it causes Wilt U

229
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
because of just blocking water and

230
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,599
nutrient uptake to the top of the plant

231
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,039
and necrosis of the of the xylem

232
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,800
fusarium headlight is fusarium garum so

233
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,360
that is infecting flowers and grain from

234
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,039
the outside um it's a very very

235
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,159
different pathogen and remember earlier

236
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,519
I talked about fusarium salani a Rootin

237
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,759
Crown Rod so there are three major

238
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,519
fusarium species that affect hemp or

239
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,240
cannabis um but back to fusarium

240
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,560
headlight uh the fusarium headlight

241
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,240
pathogens we have identified five um

242
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:46,039
fusarium garum is the common one that's

243
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,278
the one that you read so much that

244
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:53,838
affects um wheat and cereal crops um so

245
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:57,200
fusarium garum will infect um flowers

246
00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:00,839
and grain we have found it to infect um

247
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,160
growing tips and leaves but primarily

248
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:07,120
it's going to be a flower and grain

249
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:10,639
disease interesting so different type

250
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,159
different different species of fusarium

251
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,480
will kind of attack the plant from from

252
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,679
different angles that's right that's

253
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,120
right and to not just say fusarium

254
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,919
because when we started working on

255
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,200
fusarium headlight the Assumption was

256
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,559
that it was the fusarium oxysporum The

257
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,959
fusarium W pathogen and they're very

258
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,799
very different even though that first

259
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,679
name even that though that genus is the

260
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:37,359
same interesting so what are some of the

261
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:41,000
economic impacts of fusarium on hemp

262
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,079
cultivation um so fusarium headlight as

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,200
we call it will blight out um and and

264
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,319
blight is kind of a rapid necrosis

265
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,639
that's what that kind of term means a

266
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,079
fusarium headlight will blight out a

267
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,120
flower head or a seed head um so uh

268
00:11:54,078 --> 00:12:00,519
early shattering more

269
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,879
brittle more brittle flowers or or grain

270
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,600
heads but we can have it at very low

271
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,519
levels as well um so that's remember I

272
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,079
mentioned mot toxins earlier so um

273
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,560
fusarium garum produces two different

274
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:18,198
mot toxins so a myotoxin is a toxin

275
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:20,319
produced by um a fungus um so mot toxins

276
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:24,599
there are there's a history of myotoxins

277
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:30,440
in fusarium um species the tresin for

278
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:33,399
example um that can cause vomiting uh um

279
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,440
digestion issues both in humans and in

280
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,639
animals so in in hemp I'm sorry in uh

281
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,360
any feed it's highly regulated so uh

282
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,879
even low levels of disease can cause

283
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,519
high levels of toxins and that's

284
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,919
something that we're not regulating here

285
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,120
in the US not in h not in cannabis so

286
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,799
everyone is really interested in looking

287
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,440
at

288
00:12:53,799 --> 00:13:01,000
um apoxin or or some of those other um

289
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,560
toxins which we're not finding um but we

290
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,159
are finding those fusarium Moto toxins

291
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:09,078
from the headlight pathogens so again

292
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,639
all the Fus area out there but that's

293
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:12,679
our Focus because that's what we're

294
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,480
seeing the most and that's what we feel

295
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:18,759
is the most important especially as hemp

296
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,079
as an animal feed is coming onto Market

297
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,159
yeah so you you mentioned that ferium

298
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:27,439
could be there in low levels so might it

299
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,719
sort of Escape some visual detection and

300
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,720
have some of those microt toxins

301
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,160
present I'm going to Spill the Beans a

302
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,720
little bit uh my graduate student just

303
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,240
came in with some year one data from uh

304
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,160
two different fields here in um in

305
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,480
Central Kentucky and he had fusarium

306
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:48,159
headlight at about 5% severity so think

307
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,639
about that whole seed head and about

308
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:54,679
visually 5% of that head had symptoms um

309
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,320
so very low something that a grower

310
00:13:54,679 --> 00:14:00,599
would probably Overlook something that I

311
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:04,120
might have said oh well and he ended up

312
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,639
detecting um Dawn deoxy no valinol uh he

313
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,120
ended up detecting Dawn at levels that

314
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,039
are above the threshold for human

315
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,278
consumption in other grains so of course

316
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,278
we don't have that threshold for him but

317
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:19,879
that that threshold would I mean that

318
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:22,480
would have failed um um a QC in a Serial

319
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:25,278
grain market and so we're finding those

320
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,680
high levels of toxins and and in a year

321
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,720
of drought and extreme heat this year we

322
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:33,719
had low levels of disease

323
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,199
wow and so that is not being tested now

324
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,839
th those microt toxins aren't being

325
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:40,240
tested for in in hemp products that is

326
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,120
correct that is correct and so that was

327
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,639
one of our delays in um in releasing

328
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,320
some of our data we wanted to double

329
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,000
check and triple check and quadruple

330
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,720
check because we didn't want to send a

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,720
scare in the market we wanted to make

332
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,800
really sure that what uh we were seeing

333
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,959
was a trend and it wasn't just isolated

334
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:59,319
incidents um so um that is correct we

335
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:03,359
are not we're looking at a lot of microb

336
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,959
testing in in hemp in some states um it

337
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,278
seems like there's a huge interest in

338
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:11,399
apoxin right and some of the other

339
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,480
toxins and um we have we just don't have

340
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,759
those regulations in hemp anyway unless

341
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,480
it's at a state level but they're only a

342
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,800
few states that are regulating those

343
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,800
things but they're not talking about uh

344
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:25,198
fusarium toxins especially not the

345
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,319
tresin wow yeah that was going to be my

346
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,159
question where are those regulations

347
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,040
coming from are at a federal level or

348
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,360
state

349
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:36,838
level well you know we could do a whole

350
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,839
podcast on on regulations

351
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:44,278
right some states are are testing and so

352
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,519
we we hope that we can get the data out

353
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,720
that's um that's both going to help the

354
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,278
hemp industry not hurt the hemp industry

355
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,160
but also make sure that we are uh

356
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,919
producing Safe products for our end use

357
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,439
um end consumers which could be animals

358
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,958
or PL or or humans

359
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,279
excellent all right I think we've kind

360
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,439
of set the stage for the stakes um yes

361
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:07,958
um so what about prevention um what are

362
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,440
the best practices for preventing

363
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,919
fusarium in different growing

364
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,480
environments well that's the

365
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:18,240
million-dollar question right so um so

366
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,000
what we know about fusarium griin arum

367
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,159
is the most pop is the most common um

368
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,839
species that's causing fusarium

369
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:28,439
headlight so if I say fusarium gmin arum

370
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,560
that's kind of the big one um so we know

371
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,880
what we know about fusarium garum and

372
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:37,638
other headlight um producing uh fusaria

373
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:41,000
we know from wheat and barley and and

374
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,720
and cereals and corn so we we base a lot

375
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,240
of things off of that until we can

376
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,680
generate our own data so in wheat so I'm

377
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,039
going to give you a life cycle because

378
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:53,719
you know nerdy Pathologists so in wheat

379
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,240
wheat is a cool season crop yarum comes

380
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,319
in it really kind of infects during

381
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,000
anthesis which is when that anther is

382
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:02,919
kind of Pok out of that wheat flour um

383
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,959
and that's when infection occurs and in

384
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:09,798
Kentucky for example um that's happening

385
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,000
in May we're harvesting wheat in June

386
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:13,798
and then we've got a hemp crop that

387
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
really is not going in until July in

388
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:19,759
most cases so by the time hemp starts

389
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,439
flowering and is ultra susceptible to um

390
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:26,439
to fusarium infection it's July August

391
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,440
so how are we having this TW month or

392
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:32,919
more um

393
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,279
um division between that that wheat

394
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,960
infection and that hemp infection but we

395
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:42,319
are and what our research has told us is

396
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,960
that in in fields where there was wheat

397
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:49,918
or near Wheat we have a lot higher

398
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,079
incidents of um disease and toxin so so

399
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,600
there's a lot more fusarium garum when

400
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:58,839
there was wheat in the vcinity um and

401
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,480
what we're finding out now is that wheat

402
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,119
cover crops even though they were

403
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,640
terminated before they flowered are

404
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,479
still inducing a much higher amount of

405
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,799
disease so um I don't remember your

406
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,679
question

407
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:15,119
now what do we do about it um and that's

408
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,080
what we're trying to figure out what are

409
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,199
all the roles where is it coming from uh

410
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,038
what we do know about fusarium again

411
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,360
from the the serial grains uh research

412
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,240
is that those spores those canidia can

413
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,240
get really high up into the atmosphere

414
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,159
and they can move very long distances so

415
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,000
no one's safe right no Greenhouse is

416
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,200
safe if you've got a vent but the closer

417
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,720
we are that proximity to any wheat or

418
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:45,319
any other um any other um host plant uh

419
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,600
seems to be um really inducing a higher

420
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,399
level of

421
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:53,079
disease now is there any sort of um

422
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,840
sprays or bioagents that can be applied

423
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,480
to kind of prevent an

424
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,158
infection so right now so I'm G back up

425
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,200
just a little bit right now we don't

426
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:05,360
have any conventional fungicides or

427
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,640
pesticides labeled for for hemp um and

428
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,839
we definitely don't for um high THC um

429
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,320
cannabis so we don't have any products

430
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,240
anyway um in terms of Organics we've

431
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,918
been looking at a lot of Biologicals and

432
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,599
right now we're not finding anything

433
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,320
that is that is effective uh we have a

434
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,319
few years of field studies um and we're

435
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,519
we're trying lots of things we're

436
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:26,839
throwing a lot of things to see what

437
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,599
sticks and we just don't think we're

438
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:31,759
getting anything right now

439
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,119
interesting okay um so one of my

440
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,879
questions here how does it spread

441
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,279
between plants but it sounds like it's

442
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,559
Airborne Airborne yeah so these are

443
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,639
these are spores that can move um long

444
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:45,119
distances and I mean think about when

445
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,480
when disease spreads anyway right when

446
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,839
those spores spread it's usually wind

447
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,279
wind driven

448
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,000
rain so if you kind of think about and

449
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,639
we can look at so kind of overlaying

450
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,279
weather data with some of our sport

451
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,200
trapping data we can see that uh when

452
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,079
there's a rain event

453
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,120
that's what we'll see spikes in disease

454
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,678
um and you know that that's really

455
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,119
making a difference and you know a

456
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,759
drought year a calm year we can have a

457
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,399
lot lower disease but when we have a lot

458
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:16,158
more rain we can have a lot more disease

459
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,798
because remember fungi need at least 70%

460
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,080
relative humidity they need Leaf wetness

461
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,519
and they need moderate temperatures so

462
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:24,960
things cool down when it gets cloudy so

463
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,200
even though it's hot and dry in the

464
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,440
middle of the summer if we got a couple

465
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,759
of cloudy rainy days or even drizzly

466
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,679
it's

467
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:34,240
enough yeah that goes back to what you

468
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,400
were talking about earlier of indoor

469
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,960
versus outdoor um so the in an indoor

470
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,759
environment these are sort of um

471
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,558
conditions that you can control for or

472
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,919
you're not susceptible to the weather

473
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:50,038
yes yes that's right but greenh houses

474
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,640
are a lot or indoor environments rather

475
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:53,839
I'll just kind of lump those together

476
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,480
indoor environments are a lot more humid

477
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,480
right because we're not exchanging that

478
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,519
air uh the more we exchange air the more

479
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,720
we let things in we have identified

480
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,440
fusarium um headlight in green houses

481
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,839
we've identified it in Flowers By the

482
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,240
way for those of you who are growing

483
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:13,119
only to flower we have identified it

484
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,359
there and um we also know that it can be

485
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,798
seedborn that's a beginning of a it's

486
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,240
the beginning of a new research um

487
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,558
trajectory but uh we know that it can be

488
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,558
Seaborn now we're we're testing

489
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,440
commercial seed Lots we have not found

490
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:30,200
it in commercial seed Lots but coming

491
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,519
from harvested grain our plots we are

492
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,720
finding it so we're kind of we're kind

493
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,079
of at a Crossroads there um it'll be a

494
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,919
few years before we have that data

495
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,599
interesting okay

496
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:46,000
so identification so what are some of

497
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:50,240
the telltale signs of buium in hemp and

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,319
are there early detection um tools

499
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,599
available um right now there no tools

500
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,558
available but um a really nice hand lens

501
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,519
or a cheap hand lens or a magnifying

502
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:02,480
glass if that's what you've got

503
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,879
um and so to look inside that inside

504
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,519
that head and I'm just going to use the

505
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,840
word head in general for flowers or

506
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,918
grain looking inside kind of looking at

507
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,639
that stem looking at that rikus in there

508
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,240
and that's where it's going to start so

509
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,679
the more dense the seed head the more um

510
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,200
the more humid it is in there so if you

511
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,159
kind of separate out those flowers or

512
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,640
those um it usually starts when during

513
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,480
flowering so if you kind of separate out

514
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,159
those flowers just kind of pull it apart

515
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,000
and you can kind of see that fuzzy white

516
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,880
growth in there and that's really that's

517
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,359
how we look for it um now to identify

518
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,799
which species it is those kinds of

519
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,158
things it's always got to come back to

520
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,599
the lab it's always got to go under a

521
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,760
microscope but you can see that those

522
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,879
fuzzy seed headit uh those this fuzzy

523
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:47,158
growth that Melia in there but you're

524
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,600
GNA have to pull that U those flowers

525
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,679
apart and look inside between those

526
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,639
racings okay and then what do you do

527
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,559
after that you've you've identified it

528
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,559
oh this this plant has cerium what's

529
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,158
sort of the the next steps

530
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:05,158
we're research so we're trying to kill

531
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:07,679
our plants um so so our next steps are

532
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,600
very different if it's a grower I mean

533
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,880
unfortunately we're at a place where we

534
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,879
there's nothing that we can do right we

535
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,679
we don't have a recommendation we don't

536
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,278
have resistant cultivars um now we we're

537
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,960
looking at cultivars right and we're

538
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:23,200
kind of realizing that some are more

539
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,880
susceptible than others but um but

540
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,120
really if I'm working with the grower

541
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,880
we're talking about next year what do we

542
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,599
do next year we're making sure that uh

543
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,600
we don't have a cereal crop in the

544
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:38,439
vicinity and we're definitely saying not

545
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:42,519
to not to rotate with a susceptible crop

546
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,200
and not to use a a seral uh cover crop

547
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,079
and that's something very new because we

548
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,120
thought okay you know we're burning it

549
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:53,079
down and we're we're crimping it down

550
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:56,000
long before flowering and that's not

551
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:58,000
enough because that infection is present

552
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,240
even if it hasn't sort of emerged in the

553
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,480
flowers

554
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,038
it's there yes it's there now we have a

555
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,679
lot more we have a lot more research to

556
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:09,278
do in that in that vein I want to

557
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,080
mention before I forget um we did a

558
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,240
two-year study to look at Laten

559
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:14,960
infection so a Laten infection is that

560
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,640
dormant infection that time between

561
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,679
infection and symptom development and we

562
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,320
were looking at floral hemp um so we

563
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,759
weren't going to grain stage and so we

564
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:29,000
planted hemp every two weeks from April

565
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:33,158
until I think September

566
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,558
and then we sampled every week um so in

567
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,919
in theory we had we had every growth

568
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,879
stage at every week through the season

569
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,600
um and we looked at weather data we

570
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,200
looked at growth stage and so what we

571
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:49,278
found is that uh we can we are detecting

572
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,080
latent

573
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:55,159
infection six weeks or more before

574
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:57,960
symptom development we're detecting it

575
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:00,120
long before uh flower initiation so

576
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,319
we're finding it very early in the

577
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:06,599
season I think as early as May um for

578
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:08,720
those early planted um early planted uh

579
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,798
hemp so remember that was the same time

580
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,640
that wheat was in the field not in our

581
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:17,440
plots but in fields um so and to overl

582
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,360
weather data what we're finding out is

583
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,759
hemp does come become more susceptible

584
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:24,119
as it gets older um as it reaches

585
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,879
maturity and as it starts to produce th

586
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:29,879
it enters those reproductive phases but

587
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,559
also to layer those rainy events um

588
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:36,278
that's when we see huge spikes of of uh

589
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:38,720
fungal DNA within those plants so we're

590
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:41,240
were looking at the the DNA in latent

591
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,480
infections so the moral of that story is

592
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,880
it doesn't matter when it is um there

593
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:50,319
are times where it's more susceptible we

594
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:53,240
have more um infection and pathogen um

595
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:58,439
DNA in that plant which ultimately

596
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:01,319
becomes diseased um but anytime

597
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,919
infection can happen anytime and that's

598
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:07,119
really scary because um in a lot of your

599
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,679
cereals that you know they're always

600
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,439
targeting that anthesis uh when those

601
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,000
anthers start protruding but with hemp

602
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,960
it looks like latent infection is a lot

603
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,720
more common than we expected and so

604
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,319
that's going to take a lot of rethinking

605
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,399
on what a recommendation would look like

606
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,798
okay and so when those symptoms at what

607
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:27,798
stage in the plants development do those

608
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:31,720
symptoms tend to emerge is it during

609
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:35,519
sort of flowering reproductive stage yes

610
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,360
so um so it symptoms so disease is what

611
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:41,079
we call symptoms right so Laten so

612
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:45,278
infection is when we can detect the DNA

613
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:46,960
inside is that with qpcr yes with qpcr

614
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,038
excellent um and anybody listening

615
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,440
that's quantitative PCR it can detect

616
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,558
really low levels of DNA from plant

617
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,000
tissue whatever tissue we choose and in

618
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:57,839
that case it was leaves growing tips uh

619
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,798
male Flowers By the way can become

620
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,798
infected

621
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:05,158
and U female flowers

622
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:07,558
but um what was your question um I'm so

623
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:09,240
sorry I forgot your question no I think

624
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:11,720
we were talking about the latent um

625
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,079
identifying a latent infection um so I

626
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,519
can just I can just skip to the next

627
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:18,240
question so okay I'm sorry no that's

628
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:21,038
quite all right I went off on a tangent

629
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,120
I mean I think just for the purpose oh

630
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,158
now I remember what we were talking

631
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:25,839
about um when do the symptoms emerge at

632
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,200
what stage of development of the plant

633
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,398
and I think we we said it was during

634
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,120
sort of the reproductive stage so later

635
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,839
the later you go into the reproductive

636
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,158
stages of course induced by a rain event

637
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,278
but the heavier and more dense that uh

638
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,679
that seed head or flower head is the

639
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:44,640
more moisture it's holding um I think

640
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,480
there's a lot more symptoms in Grain um

641
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,038
so there must be something physiological

642
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,839
in there and of course I don't have any

643
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:52,519
data to back that up it's just

644
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,839
observational um but definitely the

645
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,440
bigger and denser and heavier it is at a

646
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,158
rainy event and or like you know when it

647
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,960
starts cooling off late in the summer

648
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,278
and you kind of get those foggy dewy

649
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,679
mornings that's kind of the same thing

650
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,278
right so add moisture and it it really

651
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,080
it really gets worse so the longer you

652
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:12,960
go into the season in general yeah I

653
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,558
think any of us in the Northeast who

654
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,720
have tried to grow hemper cannabis um

655
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:22,720
experience that once the fall Hits when

656
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,919
you have those dense um dense flowers

657
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,120
and those cool mornings cool wet

658
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,519
mornings that's when uh the fuzz starts

659
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:33,479
to come out so so yes going back to the

660
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:36,200
latent infection um

661
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,798
are can a plant with a latent infection

662
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,919
infect another plant or are they not um

663
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,038
infectious that technically that answer

664
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,720
is no so infection occurs when a Spore

665
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:51,278
uh Canadia which is an asexual Spore so

666
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,240
when a Spore moves so disease has to

667
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,919
develop the fungus has to sporulate and

668
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,798
release that Spore and that Spore land

669
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,038
on another plant and when that Spore

670
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:02,000
lands on the other plant they must have

671
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:05,278
moderate temperatures and free water in

672
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,839
order for that infection to occur so um

673
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,798
a latent infection plant know but what

674
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,558
we're finding is that if there is latent

675
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:14,918
infection it means there was a Spore

676
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:17,678
deposition event in some at some point

677
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,960
so we usually have widespread so maybe

678
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,519
one latent infection plant ends up

679
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,319
having disease symptoms in two weeks and

680
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:27,640
another one might develop symptoms in

681
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,398
four weeks so we don't know um we don't

682
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,278
know what connections are we have not

683
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,239
tracked individual spores we have not

684
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:34,919
tracked

685
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,240
movement okay yeah and you you touched

686
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,880
on before genetic resistance and that

687
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:44,079
there are no uh resistant genetics out

688
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,960
there right now but um are there certain

689
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,558
strains or certain physical

690
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,640
characteristics of the plant that can

691
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:54,798
make them less susceptible to uh an

692
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,240
infection so we um we we're accumulating

693
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:00,960
data so I am U part of a multi-state

694
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:04,440
group that that plants the same group of

695
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,399
um cultivars across many states and so

696
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,440
we have tap my working group has tapped

697
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,918
into that whole network so we're going

698
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,360
to start trying to uh understand which

699
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,320
of those cultivars these are hemp

700
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,959
cultivars by the way uh which of those

701
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,599
cultivars are more susceptible but what

702
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,200
we have found anecdotally uh over and

703
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:26,240
over is that the more uh heavy and dense

704
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,640
a seed head is the more disease you'll

705
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,880
have and you know you've always got

706
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,720
those Bly ones with that spacing in

707
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,080
between the the ray seams um there must

708
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,880
be more air circulation going there and

709
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:41,199
not having that humidity that's our

710
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,840
guess um so bigger chunkier seed heads

711
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,360
um are definitely going to have a lot

712
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:48,000
more disease than the more sply ones and

713
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:52,079
I would imagine it' be the same for for

714
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,720
flower as well exactly yeah um so and

715
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,000
and I mean that again that kind of goes

716
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,440
back to those principles of Plant

717
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,278
Pathology that free water that um

718
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,639
indirect you know Sun not being able to

719
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:05,079
penetrate and of course with a flower

720
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:07,038
flowers are um are wet and sticky uh

721
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,599
whereas when you get to the later season

722
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,359
with the with seed I mean they're

723
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:13,079
they're dry and crispy so that infection

724
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,000
event probably taking place when you've

725
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:18,720
got that higher moisture interesting

726
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,480
okay all right so I guess looking

727
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,480
forward here

728
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,759
um what are your sort of your next steps

729
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:29,839
or projects that you're working on to to

730
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:33,079
better understand this so um one of my

731
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,959
graduate students it has transformed um

732
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:37,199
the fungus with uh green fluorescent

733
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,558
protein so he is going to track

734
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,319
infection we're looking at seeds so

735
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:44,240
we're looking to see whether an infected

736
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:46,119
seed can actually carry uh the pathogen

737
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,240
and it if it can move its way up so

738
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:49,599
those are a couple of the things that

739
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,359
we're doing and we're we're looking for

740
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,839
connections and and better

741
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,759
identification of uh Dawn the mot toxin

742
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:58,439
um and it's especially hard in flowers

743
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,119
because you've got all those red that

744
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,320
affect the protocols um we're looking at

745
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,038
other mot toxins as well so we've

746
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:07,158
completed some surveys those kinds of

747
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,398
things um we would like to look more

748
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,840
into the animal feed Market because it

749
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:15,359
seems like that's where you're going to

750
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:17,439
have that bulk of um of of hemp product

751
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,879
they could really be taking some of this

752
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,639
fusarium um far and wide and have

753
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,799
probably the most effect so those are

754
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:26,678
kind of our big our big projects in the

755
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,918
future we're continuing a lot of our

756
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,360
field studies the for trapping those

757
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,600
types of things um we have looked at uh

758
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:37,038
we've done some genetic analyses on the

759
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:38,798
fusarium that's infecting hemp and it is

760
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,919
the same one that's affecting wheat so

761
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:44,359
we know that those populations are the

762
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:47,880
same um so so that's our immediate um

763
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:49,719
look forward um there are a lot more

764
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,880
questions right what happens if you're

765
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,159
using spent hemp like after the oil's

766
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,559
been pressed uh from flowers so if you

767
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,320
using byproducts to make animal feed you

768
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:03,398
know do you have that movement of those

769
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,879
uh mot toxins from there what does what

770
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,759
does stored hemp look like we've done

771
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,960
some stored hemp studies what is stored

772
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:13,158
hemp look like um and what is that

773
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,440
timing right so once you dry down um

774
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,799
those seeds or those flowers for to a

775
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,798
certain degree right less than you know

776
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:24,319
15 or 10% um moisture do you stop that

777
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:25,918
Dawn U toxin production because that's

778
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,079
what's happening in wheat so can we dry

779
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,080
it down more quickly and stop that and

780
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:34,278
production so lots of questions a

781
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:36,960
million questions and um we're trying to

782
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:40,079
prioritize um I'm an extension Professor

783
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,360
so my my questions connect directly to

784
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,720
Growers um so always trying to solve

785
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,079
those grower problems first and then

786
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,919
doing the fun curiosity science in

787
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:52,638
between excellent all right well winding

788
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:57,240
down here um Nicole please share any

789
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:58,918
other links or um studies or resources

790
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,278
um that you think would be helpful to

791
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,840
the listeners I'm happy to put the links

792
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,519
right in the show description so people

793
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:07,599
can easily find them okay definitely

794
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,358
will we have some new Publications in

795
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,519
the pipeline right now so check back on

796
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:14,078
some of these resources and these uh

797
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,239
links that I'm going to send and that

798
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,039
way you'll be able to see kind of as we

799
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,199
move

800
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,878
forward all right Nicole all right

801
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,199
thanks again for for taking the time to

802
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,639
talk to us about ferium and hemp

803
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,439
diseases and um absolutely I look

804
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:31,880
forward to doing this again fun thanks a

805
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:44,300
lot good to see you all right bye
