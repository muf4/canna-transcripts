she is instrumental in developing and

42
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:03,000
maintaining the rigorous safety and

43
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,239
quality protocols the brand is known for

science-based safety parameters to

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,239
protect consumer health and has worked

47
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:15,199
with policy makers to implement sensible

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,360
regulations to protect public health and

49
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:21,280
maintain access to regulated cannabis

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,560
products she has multiple peer-reviewed

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,479
papers on Vape safety and most recently

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,878
her work has been adopted into two ASM

53
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,840
Global standards

54
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:37,120
at CED 25 Shauna will present

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,000
toxicological risk and cannabis Vapes

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,560
exogenous additives and their

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,519
implications on consumer safety it will

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,319
highlight specific higher risk

59
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,719
ingredients and identify how prevalent

60
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:52,119
they are in vaporization products

61
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,680
currently in the Cannabis

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,039
market during our conversation we

63
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,080
discussed the main components of

64
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:03,079
cannabis Vape products how and why

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,200
exogenous ingredients are added to vape

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,640
products how toxicological risks are

67
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:12,839
evaluated based on Hazard and exposure

68
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:16,279
level why one can't assume that safe

69
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,878
food ingredients are also safe for

70
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,199
inhalation why risk assessment based

71
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:24,878
regulations are a better approach than

72
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,479
outright bans on flavors and

73
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,318
more before we get to my conversation

74
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,719

the toxicological and societal

81
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:52,438
implications of their product they do

94
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,639
good afternoon shaa thanks so much for

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,800
joining us on the

96
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,280
podcast hey Ben thanks for having me

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,759
here I'm really excited I'm excited too

98
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,918
first of all I'm excited that you're

99
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,280
going to be joining us at caned 25 in

100
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,319
June down in Puerto Rico uh your the

101
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,279
name of your talk is going to be

102
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,599
toxology risks of cannabis Vapes

103
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,519
exogenous additives their implications

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,199
for Consumer safety um as we were saying

105
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,599
before we started recording here um

106
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,240
cannabis Vapes are very popular so I

107
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,639
think this is a very popular topic um

108
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,680
but before we dive into it too deep I

109
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,800
wanted to just ask you off the top what

110
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,478
motivated you to conduct this study on

111
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,280
the toxicological risks of cannabis

112
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,079
Vapes yeah that's a great question um

113
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,478
what really motivates me and like

114
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,719
everything I do here at true Turpin is

115
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:33,360
always about consumer health and safety

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,919
safety um so with Vape products it's a

117
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,720
unique product in the Cannabis space

118
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:43,478
because it allows the manufacturer to

119
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,319
add or adjust levels of different

120
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:48,599
ingredients um that's going to be

121
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,240
different than say a flower where you

122
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,120
can't really adjust how many canabo or

123
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,199
tpin or other additives that go into it

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,360
so because you have this ability to do

125
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:03,038
that with Vapes we were curious to see

126
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,038
what types of ingredients are being used

127
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,000
when they're creating these vape

128
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,719
formulations and to compare where true

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,839
turfing stands within the

130
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,479
industry excellent so all that's a

131
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,719
that's that's a great segue because I

132
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:19,879
was curious so you mentioned different

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,360
ingredients so what are sort of the main

134
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,959
components that we find in cannabis Vape

135
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,639
products and how do they

136
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,038
vary so cannabis Vape products there's a

137
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,038
few different categories I would say the

138
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,879
most common ones are going to be made

139
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:37,719
with a distillate and a distillate is

140
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:41,199
like a very refined canabo extract from

141
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,680
the flour and when you go through that

142
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,598
refining process you oftentimes will

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,038
lose all the volatile Turpin and other

144
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:51,560
flavor molecules that are naturally in

145
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,598
the cannabis plant so to kind of

146
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,399
recreate that natural composition of the

147
00:06:54,598 --> 00:07:01,279
plant manufacturers will add ppines and

148
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:04,519
other flavorant back into this

149
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,598
distillate extract um like I said those

150
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,279
are probably the most common types of

151
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:12,199
formulations but you also have live

152
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,719
resin which is going to be a more

153
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,240
broadspectrum

154
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,319
extract um or you're going to have like

155
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,240
a live rosin which the live rosin is

156
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,160
going to be the most like delicate way

157
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,918
of extracting so those will oft times

158
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,000
carry the natural Tarpin into the

159
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:33,359
extract but in regards to these like

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,639
tpine additives there's a lot of

161
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,240
different compounds that can be included

162
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,759
and I'm going to use the word tpine as

163
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,000
an umbrella term going forward just for

164
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,000
ease of conversation but that also

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,959
includes terpenoids Esters flavonoids

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,720
ketones alahh lots of these really high

167
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,318
volatile High

168
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,960
aromatic um compounds that are often

169
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:03,199
naturally in the cannabis plant but but

170
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:06,799
we can also add some other ones to kind

171
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,360
of increase the aroma create new and

172
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,800
unique flavors that cannabis consumers

173
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,520
really enjoy excellent so you said that

174
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,079
it's most common for it to start with

175
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,478
sort of the distill it as you said so in

176
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,240
what form is that is that like a powder

177
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,839
or is it sort of that oily viscous

178
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,478
material that we actually see in the

179
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:30,038
vape pen what does that look like yeah

180
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:33,080
it's usually that oily viscous material

181
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:37,679
um if it's really refined it can be a

182
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,959
more clear amber color uh or if it's

183
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,879
more closer to like a live rosin

184
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,879
material it's going to kind of be a more

185
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:49,120
like a darker Amber like a golden kind

186
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:52,120
of extract but it is very viscous so

187
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,879
without any tpping at all it can be very

188
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,360
challenging to like aerosolize it in a

189
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:01,879
vape device because it's just so thick

190
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,800
so the tpin also help to liquefy it a

191
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:08,200
little bit so that it can be you know

192
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:11,679
efficiently efficiently aerosolized in

193
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,519
The Vape Pen excellent explain a little

194
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,199
bit more about the methodology behind

195
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,000
your uh toxicological risk assessment

196
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,320
that you're

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,399
performing yeah that's a great question

198
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:31,079
so toxicological risk is a component of

199
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:34,519
the the unique um hazard risk of each

200
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:38,078
ingredient coupled with the exposure

201
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:40,440
level so I always like to describe this

202
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,399
in terms of alcohol most of us are all

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,640
very familiar with alcohol so for

204
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:49,120
example ethanol that is the compound

205
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:52,319
that has the inherent risk in

206
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,440
alcohol and so we understand the

207
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,200
toxicity of ethanol then you compare

208
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,519
with with the exposure level so for

209
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,000
example one glass of wine you're

210
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,480
probably going to feel totally fine um

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,559
you'll wake up the next day feel totally

212
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,159
great go about your day no problem so

213
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,359
that is a very low exposure to ethanol

214
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:18,439
so the risk is very low but then let's

215
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,720
say you know after I do my presentation

216
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,040
I'm really excited I'm going to

217
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,320
celebrate and I drink a whole bottle of

218
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:27,360
wine so that's a much higher exposure

219
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,800
and while I'm drinking that bottle of

220
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,399
wine I might lose a little bit of

221
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,639
balance right I might say things that I

222
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,200
think are really funny but maybe not be

223
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,079
so funny um and then the next day when I

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,000
wake up I'm probably going to be very

225
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:46,078
dehydrated I might have a headache but

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,600
ultimately I have a really great

227
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,638
breakfast and by the end of the day I

228
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,480
feel totally fine again so the risk

229
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,278
between you know a glass of wine and a

230
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,800
bottle of wine is a little bit higher

231
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,879
because we're doing we're getting

232
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:03,000
exposed to a higher level of that

233
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,799
ethanol so that's the idea behind a risk

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,919
assessment because nothing and I mean

235
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:13,559
nothing in this world is 100% safe so

236
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,958
it's really important to understand the

237
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,278
inherent risk of that individual

238
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:21,000
component but then also to understand

239
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,600
how much of that component how much of

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,919
that ingredient can a consumer be

241
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,000
exposed to without having any risk or

242
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,479
without having any like you know the

243
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,919
risk is at a negligible

244
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,039
level so the methodologies that I employ

245
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,479
here at true

246
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:43,000
tping um includes surveying all of the

247
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
publicly available data on each

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,879
individual

249
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,039
ingredient compiling all that reading it

250
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,159
understanding the

251
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:57,078
conclusion and then I perform a set of

252
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:59,799
calculations which is very standard in

253
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:02,719
toxicology um and so the these

254
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:05,359
calculations do things for example if it

255
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,879
was a study with a rat we need to

256
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,480
understand what that means in a human so

257
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:14,720
I do a calculation to put it into the

258
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,120
levels that a human would be exposed to

259
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,879
then I need to put it into the exposure

260
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,320
of a cannabis consumer right so I

261
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,240
understand how much is a cannabis

262
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,199
consumer vaping every single day how

263
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,839
much of this extract are they being

264
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:31,559
exposed to every day so that's a really

265
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,320
important

266
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:37,319
calculation then once I get that calcul

267
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,600
or once I get that answer from the human

268
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,639
exposure

269
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,159
level I apply a set of uncertainty

270
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,959
factors or safety factors there are

271
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:52,039
sometimes called and so what that means

272
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:54,958
is we found this limit from a study

273
00:12:52,039 --> 00:13:00,360
where there was no Adverse Events to the

274
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:02,838
rat but we're not 100% sure if a rat is

275
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,360
totally equivalent to a human so we're

276
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:09,320
going to apply this uncertainty factor

277
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,919
which brings this No Effects level down

278
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,560
let's say 10 times so now it's 10 times

279
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:18,639
smaller limit so it's going to be more

280
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:21,000
conservative limit so we can be more

281
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,079
confident that that limit is not going

282
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,399
to cause harm to our cannabis consumers

283
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,719
in the final product so that's kind of a

284
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,799
brief overview of you know what a

285
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,720
toxicological risk assessment is and how

286
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,159
I perform that excellent excellent so in

287
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,278
your example with alcohol you're

288
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:43,399
mentioning how ethanol is sort of the

289
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:45,759
the compound um that can cause harm I

290
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,440
guess for lack of a better term so when

291
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,278
you're looking at cannabis Vapes what

292
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,199
are sort of the ingredients that that

293
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,078
are kind of of

294
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,799
Interest I try to look at every single

295
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,559
ingredient that's in there um even uh

296
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,838
impurities are important to look at

297
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,159
so you know you can do this work with

298
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,279
canabo but there's been a lot of studies

299
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,000
done on THC and CBD and the commic

300
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,600
canabo that are going to be in these

301
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,198
extracts so I try to focus on these

302
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,199
other additives that are in there um

303
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:18,919
like the tpin right I work at true tping

304
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,439
so what we really care about are these

305
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,278
like tpine Blends that being added into

306
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
this

307
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:27,799
distillate so I look at every single

308
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,559
ingredient within this tarpine blend and

309
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:33,719
some tarpine blends can have upwards of

310
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,719
40 different components in it so I

311
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,879
perform a risk assessment on each

312
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,440
individual

313
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,759
component excellent excellent and yeah

314
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,519
no it's it's great that you mentioned

315
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,079
tpes because especially in Vapes and

316
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,919
them being added back in they can

317
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:52,679
sometimes be at unnatural levels right

318
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,240
so that would be a concern or at least

319
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:58,719
something to look at exactly they can be

320
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:02,680
in unnatural levels or they can be at

321
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,560
level s that are a different ratio from

322
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:05,919
each other than what's found in the

323
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,919
natural

324
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:11,958
plant excellent excellent and before too

325
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:14,719
you were talking about as you were

326
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:17,518
analyzing sort of the exposure risk um

327
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,120
you taking into account how much of a

328
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:24,159
consumer typically Vapes every day um so

329
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,919
so what is that figure or what is that

330
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,240
range yeah so here at true Turpin we

331
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:32,919
like to do a range from like 75

332
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,879
milligrams a day to 100 milligrams a day

333
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:40,599
um and this is based on a few different

334
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:43,240
studies that I've done I done a study in

335
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,159
partnership with Pax when Pax had the

336
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:51,278
smart pods and so they were getting real

337
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:54,120
use data so we analyzed you know

338
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:57,559
probably over a thousand different data

339
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,639
points and we were able to come up with

340
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,799
the consumption of

341
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:07,079
95% of users and the reason why we

342
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:09,559
choose 95% instead of say the median is

343
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:12,359
because we're really trying to protect

344
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,278
most cannabis consumers out here if you

345
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,318
pick the average use then you're only

346
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,919
protecting 50% of consumers um so we

347
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:23,318
just felt like you know that wasn't

348
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:25,399
really the best use of this program um

349
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:28,120
and then there's been other studies that

350
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,198
have been published um in peer review

351
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,799
journals that looked at consumption from

352
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,078
Vape products and so we compiled all

353
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:39,240
those and that's how we get this

354
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,799
range excellent so I know that you don't

355
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,720
want to reveal uh too much of your

356
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,039
findings you got to save that for canmed

357
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,199
which I completely understand and

358
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:52,639
appreciate um but can you explain how or

359
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:55,639
how and if you identified some more

360
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,360
toxic additives in some of these Vapes

361
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,839
and sort of what are the implications

362
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,839
there for consumer health

363
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:08,359
so we first analyzed um a variety of

364
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:12,519
different tping blends that are sold on

365
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:16,119
the market uh internally we have a gcms

366
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:18,838
inhouse that can do tpine analysis so we

367
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:22,119
first ran all the products inhouse to

368
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:24,958
analyze kind of the total composition of

369
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,838
these Blends then what I did is narrowed

370
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,679
down our Target list of compounds to a

371
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:33,240
select View

372
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,840
that at true tpin we choose not to use

373
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,679
at all because I think the safety

374
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:42,720
profile um is just not not there it's

375
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,960
more hazardous than it's worth using um

376
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,319
so that is kind of the target list that

377
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:53,919
we uh started with then we sent out a

378
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:56,519
select of these samples to third-party

379
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,600
lab so we tested them by two thirdparty

380
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:02,679
labs to validate and verif verify the

381
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:05,480
results that we found in

382
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:08,280
house so you were analyzing products on

383
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,519
the market for sort of a hit list of

384
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,279
compounds that are sort of known to be

385
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:17,720
um

386
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:19,918
risky yes more or less excellent okay um

387
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,798
and so you you mentioned that you at

388
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,120
true chines you guys do not use those

389
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,158
for obvious reasons um why I mean I know

390
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,918
you can't really necessarily say why

391
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:34,440
others do but um you know is it because

392
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,440
it's a flavor enhancer or some other

393
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,080
some other reason for maybe some of

394
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,200
these additives yeah that's a great

395
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:45,079
question so a lot of these ingredients

396
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,798
are really commonly used in food so they

397
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:50,798
have a safe history of use they are

398
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:52,918
approved by the FDA for you food most of

399
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:56,079
them are grass we've heard that a lot

400
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:59,080
generally recognized as safe however

401
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,399
none of those accounts for inhaling

402
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:04,038
these compounds so when I do the risk

403
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,440
assessment I go beyond just oral

404
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:09,480
application and I assess what would it

405
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,558
do if we inhale these compounds and

406
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,919
that's where we see a higher risk factor

407
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:18,918
and I will stress that none of these

408
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,600
compounds do I believe are going to

409
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:24,000
affect your consumers today right

410
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:27,158
consumers are not dropping like flies

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,558
using these Vape products so they're not

412
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:33,200
so extreme that I'm like oh [ __ ]

413
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:36,759
cannabis consumers are in like deep [ __ ]

414
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,919
right now what we're looking at is you

415
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:43,558
20 30 40 years from now we really want

416
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,440
to see the longevity of the Cannabis

417
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:49,240
industry and so we want our clients that

418
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,480
use our products to be able to sell

419
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,679
these materials to Consumers for as long

420
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,240
as consumers want to use these products

421
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,240
so like I said I don't think we're going

422
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,558
to see problem with these ingredients

423
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,679
today or tomorrow or next year but over

424
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:08,158
20 years that's where we're going to see

425
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,559
these negative effects start adding up

426
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,760
and so we're really cautious about that

427
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,839
because like I said we want to see the

428
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:18,759
Cannabis industry Thrive for generations

429
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,959
to come yeah and when you consider that

430
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,919
a lot of uh younger the younger

431
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,360
demographic is really drawn to Vapes too

432
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,960
they probably use it more than anyone

433
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,319
else this long-term effect is even more

434
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,640
important

435
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:35,399
exactly so based on your results do you

436
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,960
see regulatory bodies kind of adopting

437
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,798
stricter guidelines or requirements for

438
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,120
testing for these

439
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:49,079
products so my hope is that

440
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:51,279
regulatories bodies don't start Banning

441
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,558
things right we don't want to see flavor

442
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,639
bands we've already seen that in some

443
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:59,599
states and really that doesn't lead to

444
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,120
safer products um it just leads to much

445
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,359
more restrictive products much more

446
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:06,959
expensive products and consumers are

447
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:09,000
oftentimes going to just travel to other

448
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,798
states to get these products that they

449
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,599
want or they're going to start buying

450
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,798
them again from the black market and

451
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:17,199
that's worst case scenario we do not

452
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,639
want to drive consumers to the black

453
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,798
market so my hope is that Regulators

454
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:28,278
will start

455
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:32,319
adopting um standards so I've uh drafted

456
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:36,000
and we got two ASM standards approved

457
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:38,759
and ASM is a global standard

458
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,720
organization um they have sectors in

459
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:45,558
pretty much every single industry

460
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:48,079
including you know shapes of stop signs

461
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:52,158
um you know safety

462
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:56,359
glasses even even sex toys have ASM

463
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:59,760
standards to apply to so I authored two

464
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:02,479
ASM standards around performing a risk

465
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,960
assessment for these exact types of

466
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,519
ingredients that go into cannaboid

467
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,960
products that will be

468
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:13,200
vaporized so my hope is that Regulators

469
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,120
will start adopting these standards and

470
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,519
say if you're going to use these

471
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:22,278
exogenous ingredients they need to have

472
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:25,038
been performed this risk assessment or

473
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:27,278
they need to follow these two ASM

474
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,759
standards and then what can happen is

475
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:32,440
regulatory bodies can can go to these

476
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,720
manufacturers and audit their risk

477
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,840
assessment

478
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,679
program so that's my ultimate goal

479
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,000
instead of saying this ingredient is

480
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,480
banned this ingredient is banned they

481
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,319
just say okay they need to comply with

482
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,960
these two ASM standards which it is how

483
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,798
it is in many Industries already today

484
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,240
yeah and so would that risk assessment

485
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:56,839
be performed on you know individual

486
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,400
ingredients or an entire formulation or

487
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:02,639
both it could be performed on both MH um

488
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,200
so if you perform it at the ingredient

489
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,480
level it's a little bit easier because

490
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,960
we know like true tping and other

491
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,159
tarping companies know exactly what

492
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,319
individual ingredients are in the blend

493
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,840
since we build it compound by compound

494
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:20,759
so it's easier to perform the risk

495
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:23,759
assessment at that level but if you are

496
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,200
say a vape manufacturer and you are

497
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,640
creating a tarpine blends yourself or

498
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,880
you're adding Tarpin isolate by isolate

499
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,759
as well you can perform this risk

500
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:40,200
assessment um or you can send your

501
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:42,240
extract to a lab that can do um analysis

502
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,480
on the chemical composition of it and

503
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,079
then you can perform the risk assessment

504
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,159
on the individual components that uh

505
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,720
show up in the lab

506
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:55,720
result excellent and you and I guess

507
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,440
just to clarify here too um this risk

508
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,079
assessment is being performed on

509
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,400
ingredients that you know the

510
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,119
manufacturer the processor knows they

511
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,159
are putting into the product it's not so

512
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:13,119
much for you know um contaminants that

513
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:15,360
are part of the the processing um the

514
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,439
the processing the processing process

515
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,158
like um you know residual solvents and

516
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,759
things like that correct yeah that's a

517
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,360
great question and I'm really glad you

518
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,038
brought up because we do want to clarify

519
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:29,759
in the ASM standard it does specify that

520
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:32,278
contaminants and impure ities are not

521
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,558
within the scope of the standard because

522
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:39,599
most of those are already

523
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:41,119
regulated by the regulatory bodies um so

524
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,038
it's you know really important to

525
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:47,158
continue doing those impurities uh you

526
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:49,720
know residual solvents heavy metals Etc

527
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,919
do that testing by your third-party lab

528
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:56,519
follow the action limits that are in you

529
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:59,480
know the regul Regulatory Agencies uh

530
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,079
that you're selling the product into um

531
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,159
that you know first and foremost you

532
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,480
need to have compliant products right um

533
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,880
but yeah this these standards are

534
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,319
specifically for you know exogenous

535
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,520
ingredients that are being added back in

536
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,639
you can perform this risk assessment on

537
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,918
for example like a live rosin product

538
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,120
that's a natural extract of the cannabis

539
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,360
plant but I always like to stress that I

540
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:30,000
am not here to police the plant if the

541
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,798
plant creates x amount ount of lemoning

542
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,159
and you have you know efficient

543
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:36,759
extraction and so that's how much loning

544
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,600
is in your final product then that's

545
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:41,759
great I'm not here to tell you that's

546
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,439
too much loning if the plant makes it

547
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,960
you know humans have been smoking the

548
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,519
plant for hundreds of years if not more

549
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,440
so there's a long safe history of use

550
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,359
there so I'm not worried about natural

551
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,360
extracts from the plant we're really

552
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:00,678
focused on exogenous ingredients that

553
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,798
are being added back in right yeah so

554
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,519
it's sort of like there's that that base

555
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,079
level of safety testing to make sure

556
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,158
that there's no impurities and there's

557
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,720
no contamination you're just going one

558
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,880
step further to be like okay whatever

559
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,720
we're adding in here let's make sure

560
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,960
that it's at levels that are safe for

561
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,360
consumption exactly excellent yeah and I

562
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,798
remembered what I wanted to ask you

563
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,359
about too because you were mentioning

564
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:24,079
that a lot of these ingredients are

565
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:26,079
generally regarded as safe but that's

566
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,798
more for ingestion and not for

567
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,119
inhalation which I think that some carry

568
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,398
over there with what we do here at

569
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:35,199
medicinal genomics where we do microbial

570
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:36,839
testing and a lot of the regulations

571
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,679
sometimes are just lifted from food

572
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:41,678
testing without taking into account the

573
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,880
fact that it is an inhaled product and

574
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,000
there are different risks for different

575
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,480
microbials um when those are ingested

576
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,599
that way so that's very important yeah

577
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,960
absolutely the risk of inhaling

578
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:55,918
something is much higher than the risk

579
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,759
from eating it for example because when

580
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,960
you eat something it goes through the

581
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,200
metabolism that's in your stomach so

582
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,120
that's going to change the compound it

583
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,360
goes through the liver that changes the

584
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,558
compound so by the time these

585
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,240
ingredients are actually absorbed into

586
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:15,759
your bloodstream and then travel through

587
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,359
your body they've been changed they've

588
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:22,519
been altered um you know in toxicology

589
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:25,199
we assume that it's only 50% of the

590
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,398
original ingredient is what's actually

591
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,200
traveling through your body versus when

592
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:32,918
you inhale something it goes from your

593
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,640
lungs directly into your bloodstream so

594
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,759
there is no metabolism that happens

595
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,799
essentially there's no metabolism that

596
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,359
happens within the lungs so we in

597
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:48,679
toxicology assume that 100% of the

598
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:51,038
active ingredient is being um you know

599
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,278
is being exposed throughout your body so

600
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:57,480
that's why it's a higher risk factor

601
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:59,440
interesting great so what is sort of the

602
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,519
key take way that you hope that the

603
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,798
industry professionals and Regulators

604
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,359
kind of gain from this presentation in

605
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:09,158
this

606
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:12,759
work yeah I really just want the whole

607
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:15,799
industry to be safer I really want to

608
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:19,759
lift up all

609
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:22,558
products um and you know a big thing is

610
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:25,000
like there are ways to substitute some

611
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,798
of these ingredients with ingredients

612
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,119
that still impart the same flavor but

613
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:34,158
have a much higher safety profile and

614
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:36,839
then if we can't do that if we can't hit

615
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,519
a flavor and make it safe you know maybe

616
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:43,240
that's the best step forward for the

617
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:46,558
whole industry do we really need coffee

618
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,200
flavored cannabis Vapes if they're gonna

619
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:53,319
be you know potentially toxic to our

620
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,720
consumers I don't think so like I really

621
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:56,759
want to push you know product

622
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,000
development teams to challenge

623
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:04,640
themselves to create these flavors with

624
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,759
safer ingredients or you know let's just

625
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,759
all band together and agree not to

626
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:12,359
create certain flavors at all because

627
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:15,319
really consumer safety should be top

628
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:18,038
priority it shouldn't be on the

629
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:21,000
shoulders of consumers to understand if

630
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:25,679
their product is safe or not to make

631
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,278
that risk versus reward Choice that's a

632
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,798
lot for them to burden so I would like

633
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:34,519
the industry to take on that burden and

634
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:36,918
we can still innovate I mean true Turing

635
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,919
still makes awesome super strong

636
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:41,880
Innovative flavors even with this

637
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,240
program and we've had this program for

638
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,640
four years now so everything that's on

639
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,599
the market today from True Turing is

640
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,240
going to comply with these toxicological

641
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,639
assessments and I still think we have

642
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,240
you know the best flavors out there so

643
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,640
this is not going to stifle creativity

644
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,640
your consumers are are still going to

645
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,038
love your products and they're going to

646
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,840
feel more confident using these products

647
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:09,038
you know for as long as they want to use

648
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:11,079
them because really consumers clearly

649
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:14,960
find these products

650
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:17,439
beneficial so for them to be able to no

651
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,360
questions ask take a product that they

652
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,038
know is beneficial and have that

653
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,759
confidence that it's only going to

654
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:27,079
provide benefit for them that's what I

655
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:29,879
want to see excellent no and you don't

656
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:32,398
have to name names or or or name flavors

657
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,200
but you in that example that you gave

658
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,599
are there certain flavors that you've

659
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,319
sort of identified like yeah we really

660
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,959
can't make this flavor safely I mean

661
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:42,079
again you don't have to say exactly what

662
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,360
that is you probably save that for

663
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,199
cannmed but but has that come up has

664
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:49,158
that happened there are flavors that are

665
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,278
really challenging to make with

666
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:55,880
ingredients that have high safety

667
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:59,638
profiles um but we've done really good

668
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:02,600
with you know skirting around that and

669
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:05,398
finding a way to make these flavors it

670
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:07,759
is a challenge but you know if you got

671
