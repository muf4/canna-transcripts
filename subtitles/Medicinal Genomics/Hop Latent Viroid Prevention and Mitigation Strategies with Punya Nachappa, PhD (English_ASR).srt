biology her research program focuses on

41
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,000
understanding the interactions between

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,799
plants and insect vectors to manage

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,840
plant pests and diseases in hemp at C

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,159
at25 Puna will present biology and

45
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,000
management of hoplon vroid which will

46
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,680
Describe the impact of hlvd on hemp

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,239
yield and canabo explain how thrips and

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,640
aphids transmit the vroid and evaluate

49
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,959
the efficacy of using chemical elicitors

50
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:33,839
to control hlvd infections

51
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,199
during our conversation we discussed how

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,519
hop Laten viroid has been reported in

53
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:43,000
every hemp grown state in the US and

54
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:46,039
Canada how hlvd spreads through infected

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,719
clones mechanical contact seeds and

56
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:51,280
insect vectors like aphids and

57
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,359
thrips possible reasons why hemp

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,239
varieties appear more resistant than

59
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,239
cannabis varieties including genetic

60
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,200
diversity and environmental factors the

61
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,640
trade-offs associated with using

62
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,119
chemical elicitors on Infected plants

63
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,158
and strategies for preventing hlvd

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,039
spread including strict sanitation

65
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,639
insect monitoring frequent testing and

66
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,560
breeding for genetic

67
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,919
resistance before we get to my

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,640
conversation with Puna I'd like to thank

good morning Puna thank you so much for

86
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,680
joining you on the podcast oh thank you

87
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:24,319
Ben uh it's been H several years that I

88
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,360
did my last podcast I'm happy to be back

89
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,719
here talking about another important

90
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,639
pathogen uh in the Cannabis and hemping

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,320
industry yeah that's right you were on

92
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,800
the podcast before talking about beat

93
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,680
curly top virus in hemp I'll put a link

94
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,879
to the show in the show description so

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,959
people can check that out and I remember

96
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,639
after we did that I was saying that you

97
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,279
need to come down to canmed and um and

98
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,918
that year it didn't work out but we're

99
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,038
excited that you're going to be in

100
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:53,680
Puerto Rico this year uh giving a top on

101
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:55,719
one of our favorite topics HP late and

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,160
vroid uh if people have been listening

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,720
to the podcast for a while we've done a

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,759
number of different talks on it it's a

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,600
an emerging problem in the Cannabis

106
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,680
space and it always gets a lot of um

107
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,840
viewers and listeners because it is so

108
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,519
interesting so excited for you to share

109
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,879
some new information that you've learned

110
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,799
about the viroid and that you'll be

111
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:22,038
sharing at ced2 but before we get into

112
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,879
the new stuff I was hoping for those new

113
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:27,120
listeners or new viewers you could

114
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,159
provide an overview of hoplon vroid and

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,840
explain its significance to the hemp in

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,319
cannabis industry yes we do uh as you

117
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:37,758
mentioned hop plate en viroid is an

118
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,879
emerging pathogen but probably doesn't

119
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,360
need much introduction because it's just

120
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:46,918
spread like wildfire I should no pun

121
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,439
intended we are La is battling these

122
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:53,560
fires but it's been such a bane uh to

123
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,959
the Cannabis industry originally as the

124
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,800
name sugges it was identified in hops

125
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:02,359
that's the uh first host but very

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,478
quickly jump from Hops uh to the nearest

127
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,400
relative of hops um cannabis and seems

128
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:11,719
to be having a more severe impact in

129
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:14,359
cannabis than it did in hops where it

130
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,039
did affect um the quality but in

131
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,439
cannabis it seems to have uh more

132
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,120
significant

133
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:25,038
impact I think it was identified or at

134
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,800
least um published reports was in 2019

135
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,360
but maybe the industry had an idea of

136
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,000
what was happening a couple of years

137
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,680
before before that so the first reports

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,399
came out in 2019 in cannabis and then my

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,680
lab subsequently found it in our field

140
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:45,079
survey of hemp here in Colorado in

141
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,519
2021 and now pretty much every hemp

142
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:52,120
growing state has um reported hoplon

143
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:55,240
virus so it's spread all all the way New

144
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Mexico up to Washington and Canada has

145
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:01,478
also been um you know U ravaged by this

146
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,800
disease I think I saw somewhere that the

147
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:07,038
reported impact was $4 billion annually

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,520
to the Cannabis industry which is

149
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,560
staggering because it impacts uh the

150
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:15,878
flow really badly right causing that

151
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,079
so-called duding where the flow um it

152
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,879
impacts the tricomes and that's where

153
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,719
the canabo are made so CBD and THC

154
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,919
levels are reduced and not only that the

155
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,039
the biomass the the plant is stunted

156
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:33,799
there are issues um with the quality of

157
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:36,038
the plant all in all impacting economics

158
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,120
and uh Downstream

159
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:42,318
pharmacological um you know applications

160
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,800
as well so all this is well well

161
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:49,080
characterized in cannabis but in hemp

162
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,400
right with the THC legally classified as

163
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:55,279
um Cannabis sativa with the THC levels

164
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:57,799
of less than 3% rightweight we did not

165
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,478
know the actual impact although field

166
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:04,280
Studies have shown that we can ident we

167
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,680
can um report it or identify it in field

168
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,839
grown hemp so uh that was one of the

169
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,680
research areas U that we focused on in

170
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,519
the last couple of years to do a

171
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,879
systematic study to understand the

172
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:18,799
impact on um field grown

173
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,720
hemp yeah I I mean very I've been very

174
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,079
aware of the problem in the Cannabis

175
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,599
industry and of course growing indoors

176
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:30,079
growing from clone and how that's a you

177
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,959
know uh a great way for hlvd to spread I

178
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,360
wasn't quite aware that it was being

179
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:38,240
seen in outdoor

180
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,639
H all of the reports from uh these other

181
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,719
states at least you know the in the

182
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,600
universities were not allowed to work

183
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,360
work on cannabis so nothing over um 3%

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,680
THC in fact at the Department of

185
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,039
Agriculture here at Colorado State at at

186
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:55,599
Colorado

187
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:58,278
CDA uh will would periodically come and

188
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,240
test our plans to make sure we are under

189
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:03,759
the legal limit and the pl don't don't

190
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,799
go MH so all of the reports from

191
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,240
the UN from these different states were

192
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:11,359
made in field grown

193
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,399
hemp except the ones from California the

194
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,159
initial ones came from Cannabis um so we

195
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,600
are finding it in field grown hemp now

196
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:24,000
um we just published it's not out yet um

197
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,200
um what we call a metagenome or a

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
metavirome so we surveying hemp send it

199
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,240
out for sequencing and then try to

200
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,920
identify the viruses in the last one we

201
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,879
did uh this was 20 22

202
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:41,439
23 um we did not find opan viroid in

203
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,399
field grown hemp which is good news uh

204
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,920
at least for the hemp Growers but

205
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,720
there's a whole another uh Suite of new

206
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:52,919
viruses that we've found but not hopl

207
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,480
and viroid which we did back in

208
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,679
2021 oh interesting so you found it in

209
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,560
2021 but your more recent surveys is

210
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:04,278
that you're not finding it not finding

211
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:08,559
it here interesting yeah yeah any ideas

212
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:13,639
where it went um good question now um

213
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:15,359
this might segue into um you know um the

214
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:19,000
some of the data that I'll be presenting

215
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,519
in canmed where we did the field a field

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,958
study um to see the impact of hopl and

217
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,120
viid on him and guess

218
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:32,119
what the infection rate was very low in

219
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,200
him it was is really uh difficult to get

220
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,159
hemp

221
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,680
infected uh with hopl and viroid you

222
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,838
know supposedly highly transmissible

223
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:44,120
right it's the TMV tobacco mosaic virus

224
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,560
which is a highly trans transmissible

225
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,480
virus it's supposed often called the TMV

226
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:53,000
of the vroid world but we couldn't get

227
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,440
our plants infected I think it it might

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,440
have to do with the genetic diversity of

229
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,560
hem as opposed to the clonally propag

230
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:07,839
ated hydroponically grown uh cannabis

231
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:12,599
that could be one reason so I I mean

232
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:15,279
this um field well it's kind of a fe we

233
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:19,000
call it a CRA so it's part it can be

234
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,679
partly um covered or you keep it open so

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,958
you know it's it's I would say it's a

236
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,599
hybrid between a greenhouse and a field

237
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,239
but you plant the hemp in the soil so it

238
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,720
could be it can be considered field

239
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,879
grown hemp so in the study the plants

240
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,440
look just great I mean we may have

241
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:39,639
gotten like 10% infection rate so I feel

242
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,720
like the the healthy environment the

243
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:48,000
genetics of hemp made it just outgrow or

244
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,920
out compete um the virus so um then the

245
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,200
other aspect is you know we do these

246
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,599
surveys or just look going into our

247
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,800
Fields whatever variety The Grow has we

248
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,759
are sampling that but it could be that

249
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:04,078
certain varieties of hemp are more

250
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:08,600
susceptible and some are not so um

251
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:11,078
there's so much left you know to be um

252
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,600
research so we were very surprised not

253
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:18,239
to find any popen vroid in our second

254
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,079
metagenome interesting and what um what

255
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,639
tissues were you testing if I may ask a

256
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:27,879
good question so we always do the leaves

257
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,000
with hemp the roots and I know um in

258
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,439
cannabis you often do the root which

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,759
again you know because of the growing

260
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,360
conditions it's easier with hemp the

261
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:41,519
roots are much harder to extract from so

262
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,959
we only test we test the apical leaves

263
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,799
but we also sample from different parts

264
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,919
of the plant because we are seeing that

265
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,919
and this has already been known some of

266
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,799
Dr pun's work has shown it's not equally

267
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,879
distributed in all parts of the plant

268
00:12:52,799 --> 00:13:00,958
sure so we are very confident about our

269
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:03,799
sampling and we also test the stem uh um

270
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:07,399
didn't find it and um

271
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:09,399
metagenomics is um highly sensitive

272
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:14,360
technique right you could get a few

273
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:16,240
reads right and we detected zero so

274
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,800
interesting yeah and I know that some

275
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,000
research and some of the research that

276
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:24,639
our CSO has done here um with you know

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,958
purposely inoculating some plants um the

278
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,360
vroid will go down into the roots right

279
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,439
and sometimes stay there you said it it

280
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,800
never kind of progresses up into the

281
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,079
later stages of the plant and it goes

282
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,559
through flower and it looks great if you

283
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:40,399
test the roots it's there but it never

284
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,439
really

285
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,278
emerges higher so it could be something

286
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,000
like that it could be something like

287
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,039
that in the in the hemp too we were

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,639
thinking about actually testing the soil

289
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:52,559
that we did our field study in yeah and

290
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,159
that's something we are planning to

291
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:58,679
do interesting um so one of my questions

292
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,559
were were any of your what were some of

293
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,439
your surprising findings in regs to your

294
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,879
study I think that's a very surprising

295
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,120
finding was there anything

296
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:13,360
else

297
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:15,440
um no well once we were you know my my

298
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,240
former Master student he just graduated

299
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,360
Luke dle did this work when we were

300
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,519
going out there I mean he just lived

301
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,680
there in that crao we knew that this is

302
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,399
you know we're not going to see any

303
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:31,159
significant changes in any of the um

304
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,480
yield p parameters cannabinoid we were

305
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:37,319
still unsure but then we decided to

306
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,879
separate out the symptomatics so we did

307
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,040
have a few symptomatic uh

308
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,759
plants when we separated out the

309
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:48,759
symptomatic plants and the asymptomatic

310
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:52,240
plants and both were hlvd positive by

311
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:57,639
PCR but when we did that we saw a

312
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,879
reduction in um CBD and um GC levels so

313
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,759
when you so it's a a little bit more

314
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:05,958
nuanced Than You Know Than Just positive

315
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,159
and negative so Growers have to really

316
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:10,958
keep an eye out for

317
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:14,120
um the symptoms because the asymptomatic

318
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:17,559
plants like you said just did

319
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,440
fine but they are indeed positive so

320
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:21,479
that was an interesting finding which I

321
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,680
think others are also figuring it out

322
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,000
but so many different things um you know

323
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,198
so many things were different between

324
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,480
our study and what's happening in

325
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:34,000
cannabis

326
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,079
um um and and this is not published data

327
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,399
and I don't know if I'm I could present

328
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:42,638
this in can in canmed we did a screen of

329
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,159
30 hemp genotypes that we got from one

330
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,198
of our collaborators here this it's a

331
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,399
hemp genetics company called New West

332
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:53,519
genetics that we work closely with here

333
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:56,240
in Port Collins and we do see um VAR

334
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,959
some genetic diversity some variation in

335
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,519
um popul viroid level so

336
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:06,599
um all of this was uh exciting and new

337
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,600
data for us excellent no and in reading

338
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,920
through your abstract as well um it said

339
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,120
that you found that cannabis aphids and

340
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:17,318
thrips can acquire and transmit hlvd as

341
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,159
well can you talk a bit more about the

342
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:23,639
significance of that

343
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:25,879
Discovery yes so this was um it was not

344
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,079
surprising in fact what was surprising

345
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:33,078
is was that in hops they found that that

346
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:37,439
Hop's apid did not transmit hop latent

347
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:39,838
vroid and this was published where my in

348
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,839
in our world I mean apid as you can see

349
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,480
in my background see how prolific they

350
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,759
are in the on hem and um they can pretty

351
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,440
much and they've been shown to transmit

352
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,879
other viroids so it was kind of

353
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,079
surprising that they that they didn't

354
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,958
find it in Hops and so we set out to um

355
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,638
test apids

356
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,038
and thrips and the reason we pick those

357
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,838
are they are the most common Greenhouse

358
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:09,000
pest right they love the greenhouse

359
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,519
environment because it's hot humid this

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,919
makes them the populations grow uh

361
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:17,918
faster they and there's a year round

362
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:21,640
supply of uh uh host host plants for

363
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,759
them within five minutes both insects

364
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,240
can acquire the the vroid which is

365
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:30,200
really interesting it is in the flm and

366
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,319
apids feed in the flm of the plant but

367
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,640
it's also in the but trips have much

368
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,960
shorter mouth Parts aphid's mouth parts

369
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,120
are like mosquitoes they're the

370
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,160
mosquitoes of the Plant World so they

371
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:45,639
can go all the way down to the flo and

372
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,759
suck up the vroid uh thps are not but

373
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,280
they must be picking it up from the

374
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,000
their cell content feeders they're going

375
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,599
to just suck up all the cell content

376
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,240
cytoplasm nucleus every all of it so

377
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,119
that so there are different mechanisms

378
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,359
by which they're acquiring the viroid

379
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:04,000
but both are doing doing it super

380
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,479
quickly um and and so that was that's

381
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,679
great any any any insect could acquire

382
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,200
it but the proof of the concept was to

383
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:15,280
then test uh transmission and to do that

384
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:19,960
we then starve the insects to to make

385
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:21,519
sure all of the gut content is is out of

386
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,079
the insect it's not just in there

387
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,440
transiently

388
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:28,960
right and then we place those insects on

389
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,640
healthy plants and sure enough both both

390
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,679
of them can transmit I think um my um my

391
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,120
other Master student is uh re retesting

392
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,798
some things but retesting some assays

393
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:44,639
but it's between 10 to 25% transmission

394
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:47,319
and we sequence every single amplicon we

395
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:53,520
you don't just rely on the band on the

396
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:56,639
PCR U uh gel band every single one is um

397
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,119
sequent so not entirely surprising the

398
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,080
other one that I'm very keen to test is

399
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:05,759
spidermites which is another huge

400
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:09,759
problem a huge Greenhouse pest um and we

401
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:12,919
also find it in outdoor hem um so couple

402
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:16,759
of other insects to test the other uh

403
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:20,038
interesting aspect is uh last year uh we

404
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:22,519
saw that hops can also infect other host

405
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,759
right some really important host host

406
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,798
plants like

407
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:33,558
tomatoes um and um cryan so we want to

408
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:36,240
see if these vectors cannabis AIDS or um

409
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:39,839
thps Can transmit it to other host

410
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,798
plants as well because it just takes um

411
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:45,038
a few minutes to acquire and seemingly a

412
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:47,240
few minutes to transmit too interesting

413
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,480
no and what about um I remember from our

414
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,558
last conversation the leaf Hoppers

415
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,360
because I know that those transmit the

416
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,879
beat curly top Ires

417
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,759
correct uh we did not we've not thought

418
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,159
about Lea Leaf Hoppers but I'm going to

419
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,279
make a note

420
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,559
yeah they are not a huge Greenhouse Pest

421
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,918
and they need so that's the big so but

422
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:10,839
um you know hovd is

423
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:13,038
outside um so we I would hypothesize

424
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:15,119
because they are floam feeders there's

425
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:18,000
no reason why they would not be able to

426
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,918
do it but the level of trans the

427
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
efficiency um would be different look at

428
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:28,880
you Ben you are a budding

429
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,558
entomol I just pay attention I guess um

430
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,919
uh and another thing that you that you

431
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:36,480
brought up the the significance of

432
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:40,720
starving the um the insects before you

433
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,159
kind of T Test the transmission so um

434
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,919
explain kind of the reason that's

435
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:51,080
important so um you know when insects

436
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,480
consume the plant sap or um you know

437
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,918
they chew the leaves like a caterpillar

438
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,960
wood whatever is in the leaf is in the

439
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,600
caterpillar or in the a in the aid you

440
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,200
if you were to grind it up and test it

441
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,199
they would be positive

442
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,279
for let's say h and viroid that doesn't

443
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,278
mean they can transmit it because once

444
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:15,240
they poop it out so goes the pathogen

445
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:18,519
with uh with the plant material does

446
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:22,159
that make sense so to be called a

447
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:25,038
vector the virus or the viroid have to

448
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,200
bind to the insect mouth part to the

449
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,558
stylid and then bind in the gut and then

450
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,200
bind and again find the salivary glands

451
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:38,079
and come out through that mechanism not

452
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:41,000
just be pooped or you know do it

453
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:44,079
transiently and to do that we allow like

454
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,240
a two to four hour starvation period

455
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:50,079
because it's shown to get rid of all the

456
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,240
gut content uh contents and then you go

457
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:55,480
ahead and you do your your assays

458
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,079
interesting okay so it's not that it's

459
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,079
just kind of taking infected blow or sap

460
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:02,798
from one plant and depositing it

461
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:05,879
elsewhere it's

462
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,879
actually systemic within the insect

463
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,159
exactly that's a great way to say it so

464
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,039
the way the process works um is insects

465
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,240
pick it up it attaches to the stylet

466
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:19,240
some you know stylight the mouth part

467
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:23,400
goes into the gut then it the virod will

468
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,720
then come out of the gut into the body

469
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,278
cavity where we have insects have

470
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,120
something called hemolymph which is the

471
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:31,798
blood of the insect H and then reach the

472
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,678
salivary

473
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:37,200
glands get into the salivary glands and

474
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,679
when the insect feeds on a healthy plant

475
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,038
through the saliva the vroid has to come

476
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,320
out this whole um mode of transmission

477
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,038
has to happen for it to be called a

478
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:51,678
vector

479
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:53,558
interesting okay all right very cool um

480
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,200
one thing I just wanted to add one thing

481
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:58,079
I wanted um so we've been doing

482
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,000
acquisition assays you know how quickly

483
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,240
they can acquired it how quickly they

484
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,759
can transmit it but what we want to know

485
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,960
like I told you the this mode of

486
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,359
transmission within the insect we are

487
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,240
doing some confocal microscopy where we

488
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:15,918
tag the the vroid with gfp you know the

489
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,319
green fluoresence protein that can glow

490
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,080
and show us all the different parts of

491
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,278
the insect body that the vroid is moving

492
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:26,480
through so we get a good understanding

493
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:30,759
of how it's circulating systemically in

494
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,798
the insect oh wow very cool yes I'm so

495
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,359
excited one of the other things that

496
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:38,038
kind of stood out from when I was

497
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:42,558
looking at your abstract was um using

498
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:44,240
potential chemical elicitors yes um to

499
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,678
kind of I guess mitigate some of the

500
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,359
negative effects of hlvd so please tell

501
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,960
us more about that yes so um chemical

502
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,879
elicitors or synthetic elicitors also

503
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,000
called plant growth Regulators as the

504
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,760
name suggest it's a chemical that mimics

505
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,839
plant

506
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:07,119
hormones so it's essentially giving the

507
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:09,759
plants a little boost to get their

508
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,959
defenses going and this is not you know

509
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:15,519
I didn't come up with this idea uh um

510
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,640
we've been using it in Plant Pathology

511
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,480
and in entomology research as a way to

512
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,200
trigger plant defenses give them a

513
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,360
little boost to get it get it

514
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,679
activated uh you could also think of it

515
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:31,079
as a way to Prime the plants and and can

516
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,519
protect against diseases and pathogens

517
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,960
because naturally plant hormones or what

518
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:39,398
we call phyto hormones are doing this

519
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,278
but they're doing it at a at a low level

520
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:45,079
so that you know the plant can um devote

521
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,480
all the resources to the different

522
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,839
functions we want to give it this boost

523
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,399
so it can get activated and the reason

524
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,240
that I was interested in this research

525
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:58,398
is because cannabis and hemp can be

526
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,759
considered organic um production Sy

527
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:04,519
systems right because the um the

528
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,440
repertoire of um insecticides and

529
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:10,119
pesticides are so limited right all we

530
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,679
have and so there are only a handful of

531
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,918
products we don't even know their

532
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,320
efficacy and it turns out that these

533
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,640
chemical elicitors are actually

534
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:22,599
registered oh for use so that's that's

535
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,240
one of the reasons we went um we were

536
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:27,879
interested in this and so our idea was

537
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:32,319
to just boost the plants innate inherent

538
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,679
immunity to better defend uh the viroid

539
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:38,000
is this prior to

540
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:41,600
infection um no we didn't do it prior so

541
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,519
we infected the plant and um a week

542
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,879
later so we got the plant um going with

543
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:49,759
the infection and then a week later we

544
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,120
sprayed these elicitors and then sprayed

545
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,879
every week for up to three weeks and

546
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,359
then subsequently I think at the fourth

547
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:02,440
or the fifth week we took uh tissue and

548
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:05,359
analyzed for hlvd levels using qpcr then

549
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,080
let the plants grow go to flowering and

550
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:12,759
then did the canabo analysis so you

551
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:16,278
could we we debated should we do it um

552
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,079
spray first then infect or infect and

553
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:20,480
then

554
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:24,839
spray uh we decided to do and I uh

555
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,360
decided to do um the former because so

556
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,759
we we got clones from infected plants so

557
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,038
they were already

558
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:34,158
infected um ready to go cuz that's

559
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:35,919
probably a more n we figured that's

560
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,159
probably more of the natural situation

561
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,960
the plants are already infected

562
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:44,440
excellent and so what were the

563
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,120
results oh my goodness so you you know

564
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,159
this already and this is how it goes

565
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:51,918
with research it's never yes perfect

566
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:54,559
result always more questions to be asked

567
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,919
offs right yes exactly but it's it's

568
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,599
great um we did two rounds of it and

569
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,640
we're actually getting ready to to do a

570
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,558
third round so the results were mixed

571
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,278
bag but very interesting what we found

572
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:10,000
was yes indeed a certain phyto hormones

573
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:13,398
or chemical elicitors reduced hlvd

574
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,319
levels interestingly they also increased

575
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,798
the

576
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:21,319
biomass um you know the yield of the the

577
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:24,079
plant which we were excited about but go

578
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:27,879
to look at the flow production and

579
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:30,439
cannabinoid levels and it was and are

580
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,559
the main major ones like CBD and THC was

581
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,320
actually

582
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:37,918
reduced how

583
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:41,000
much I don't remember the not I I don't

584
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,038
I could pull it up I'll tell you biomass

585
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,319
like almost 50% for salicylic acid the

586
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:52,599
biomass increased 50% yeah compared

587
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:55,200
compared to an infected yeah no they're

588
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:57,359
all infected compared to so the control

589
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,798
was ethanol because that's the solvent

590
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,240
salicylic acid

591
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:06,679
dissolved in in ethanol the biomass per

592
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,640
plant was 8.3 gram and in the salicylic

593
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:14,038
acid sprayed it was like

594
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:17,600
15% 15 grams oh wow yeah so almost

595
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:19,278
double almost double because these elic

596
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:23,918
these phyto hormones also cause the

597
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:26,319
plants to cause cell division in delay

598
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,440
sense and essentially giving it better

599
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,439
overall health

600
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,159
excellent so I'm just picking salicylic

601
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,960
acid uh they all look pretty much the

602
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,760
same some of the other ones I'm saying

603
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,240
brainol brassinolide was 12.8 gam

604
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:46,319
compared to eight so a little less than

605
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:50,558
50 so let's look at

606
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:57,278
um um canono we can again pick salicylic

607
00:28:50,558 --> 00:29:01,278
acid okay so TC or THC a was ,00

608
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:05,480
microgram per gram in the control in

609
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:07,200
ethanol and in sa it

610
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,319
was,

611
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,038
1300 microgram per gram what is that

612
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,678
math

613
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:21,640
30% how much 30 30 Z

614
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:25,519
30% so a third so if basically 100%

615
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:28,720
increase in biomass yeah but a 30%

616
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:31,759
decrease in th yes in thca

617
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,558
interesting interesting yeah but not so

618
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,519
interesting because guess what just

619
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:39,158
after we did this in this is a this was

620
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:42,960
a two years study from 2022 just and he

621
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:44,799
graduated uh in in fall in Fall here

622
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,480
comes a really nice study and I can talk

623
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:50,679
about that showing that in fact higher

624
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,240
levels our goal was to cause induction

625
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,600
our our the aim of our study you know

626
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,599
because we were kind of going blind was

627
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,439
we wanted to make sure the plant the

628
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:04,199
these um Pathways in the plant salicylic

629
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,720
acid or what what have you was uh was

630
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,519
turned on so we we went a little high on

631
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,319
the dosage and then a paper came out

632
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,278
saying higher dosage can reduce canono

633
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:19,558
whereas a low

634
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:22,440
dosage so since that paper came out we

635
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:26,798
are now we've got to fine tune the the

636
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:30,679
rates it's not so over applying it can

637
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:32,839
improve um reduce hlvd levels and um

638
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,759
biomass but does not have the same

639
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,678
impact for canabo which is important so

640
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,079
you got to fine-tune this and so we're

641
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,720
redoing um that experiment it's already

642
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:46,639
started and I should have some new data

643
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,480
uh for Canin excellent so you so there

644
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,559
is some fine tuning in in figuring that

645
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,759
out but but some poti potential yes for

646
00:30:52,558 --> 00:31:00,558
sure there's potential for instance um

647
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:04,879
we applied 10 m molar of um salicylic

648
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:08,240
acid and the papers are saying 1.5 is

649
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,320
probably the the better um uh you know

650
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,839
value better concentration to go so we

651
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,918
might not we may not see an induction in

652
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:21,079
a PCR gel of the salicylic acid pathway

653
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,360
marker Gene but that's the way to go so

654
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,398
we're going to play around with the

655
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,319
dosage and

656
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:32,119
timing uh to fine tune that because

657
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:35,158
Growers don't have too many options um

658
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:38,119
for these um for HD and the other nice

659
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:41,440
thing about these elicitors is they also

660
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:44,319
confer protection against pests my own

661
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,120
lab has shown like salicylic acid can

662
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:50,879
reduce um

663
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:53,599
thps J right so you are literally

664
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,600
jasmonic acid are good against aphid so

665
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:59,158
you can actually kill two birds with one

666
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:02,480
stone so it's just a matter of

667
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:06,039
fine-tuning great and now in terms of

668
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,839
accessibility to the these um these

669
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:10,720
compounds these chemicals what whatever

670
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,879
you we're calling them elicitors um are

671
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,000
they EAS easily accessible pretty pretty

672
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:20,440
affordable as well yes pretty affordable

673
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,960
um not all so we used um you know um

674
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,798
chem like chemicals standard grade uh

675
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,440
chemicals because this was um a

676
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,839
scientific study but these products are

677
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,480
available in the market to buy and and

678
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,798
apply some of them are commercially uh

679
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,679
available and actually for the this new

680
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:42,759
round of experiments we've got going on

681
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,720
I've asked my lab manager to try to get

682
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:49,200
uh the commercially available one so we

683
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:53,000
try to make it as um applicable uh to

684
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,960
Growers excellent all right so in terms

685
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,240
of practical advice to Growers who are

686
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,079
concerned about hlvd

687
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,480
dealing with hlvd um based on the

688
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,038
studies you've done and the research

689
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,679
you've done what are some sort of

690
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:10,679
practical strategies to prevent or um

691
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,919
eliminate an hlvd

692
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:18,360
infection so we are finding that plant

693
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,720
Health really is um you know is crucial

694
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:24,240
in in terms of our um field experiment

695
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,839
where we saw that healthy plants were

696
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,798
impossible to even get

697
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:31,558
infected so that was that was key and

698
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,960
then these elicitors that boosted well

699
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:37,440
there were these tradeoffs um you know

700
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,038
um keeping the plants healthy did see

701
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,120
reduction in the vroid um

702
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:46,679
levels and given that

703
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:49,479
um now we know that these insect PES are

704
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,399
vectors I think monitoring for both

705
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,079
early symptoms of the disease because it

706
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:58,398
just takes one plant to serve as a host

707
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:01,199
for secondary spread

708
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,959
right it's not just quarantine it but

709
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,880
it's it's it may be too late the insects

710
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,440
already have it and then they are going

711
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,838
around infecting it so I think

712
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,679
monitoring for insects so we have sticky

713
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,279
trap and we do this in my lab it's the

714
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:18,240
bane of my lab too we've never had this

715
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,480
much quarantining and uh care um

716
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,078
everything is in different places and I

717
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,240
I know Growers are already doing this so

718
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:28,320
keep your replay sticky cards often and

719
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,638
testing testing testing testing

720
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,320
testing which I know is expensive and we

721
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,159
actually have a project under way to

722
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,720
develop some um

723
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:41,919
onsite um field based Diagnostics you

724
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,078
know because it's getting it's even 20

725
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,638
what is it right now I think it's 25

726
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,720
dollars per sample it's so expensive and

727
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,960
timec

728
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:54,158
consuming so I think

729
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,519
um yeah I know there are some tests out

730
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,320
there but um we are trying to work

731
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:00,280
something out with some collab ators in

732
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,079
University of Wisconsin Madison so I

733
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,280
would say monitoring sanitation avoid

734
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:07,519
cross

735
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,880
contamination and testing uh based on

736
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:13,400
the research uh that I know I hope in

737
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,920
the coming years um you know some of the

738
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,200
things we've talked about um breeding

739
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,800
for that they would be resistant Vari

740
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,799
genotypes varieties and genetic

741
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,880
engineering I mean USDA approved um

742
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:31,039
these transgenic hemp right at least in

743
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,039
theory M so I think those are all uh

744
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,039
possibilities we'll have to look think

745
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,400
about the sort of social stigma of GMOs

746
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,960
that still

747
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,039
exist yeah of course and you know

748
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,639
interesting thing that we're adding to

749
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,800
this year's caned we're having a whole

750
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:51,118
genomics Workshop all about um um it's

751
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,160
kind of a halfday workshop exploring the

752
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,559
use of genomics in in breeding and in

753
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,879
different applications for cannabis so

754
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,039
we're going to be talking about about

755
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,160
you know genetic engineering and GMOs

756
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:03,639
and and and touching on those things so

757
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,920
uh I think it's going to be a great

758
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:07,759
session um to sort of have those

759
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,280
conversations because uh it seems like

760
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,560
that's the way things are eventually

761
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,839
going to go GNA go exactly no I thought

762
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:16,639
that I'm super excited about it I saw

763
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:20,159
Todd Michael is is coming yes so I'm

764
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:25,440
very excited yeah so I yeah this one

765
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:28,480
because it's so resilient and so yeah um

766
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,679
yeah no we need all the you know the

767
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,920
throw the whole kitchen sink approach uh

768
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,279
for it sorry no and no when you were

769
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,760
talking about plant health and it kind

770
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,319
of just clicked in my head and you know

771
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,160
I as I understand it outdoor hemp is

772
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:45,920
largely grown from seed whereas indoor

773
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,838
cannabis largely grown from clones and

774
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,559
there's always been the conversation of

775
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:53,279
you know growing from sea that have more

776
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,440
Vigor and our just more resilient plants

777
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,440
and I wonder if that could be you know

778
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,240
part of why you're seeing resilience in

779
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,838
in the in the H plants for sure so in in

780
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:07,679
our field study we the we had a um what

781
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:11,199
we call a dual purpose grain fiber hemp

782
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:15,679
uh variety which was grown from seed and

783
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:20,719
we had a high CBD line that was clonally

784
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:24,440
propagated so we tried to do both but it

785
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:26,919
but it didn't matter both the yeah dual

786
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,159
the seed grown and the clonally

787
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,880
propagated um High CBD line that we like

788
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:36,838
to use in in our

789
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:39,440
lab um did not have uh much diff any any

790
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,400
difference in the infection rate No but

791
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,838
you know this is just one clone right

792
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,559
but but yeah one yeah that's not the

793
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:48,759
case in the Cannabis industry so you are

794
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:52,279
AB I think there's something there about

795
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,560
the plant health and the conditions

796
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,680
excellent all right well pun winding

797
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,719
down here um I did want to give you an

798
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:02,159
opportunity to share any other resources

799
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,358
or links uh that you think might be

800
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,679
useful for anyone who's watching or

801
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:09,799
listening who wants to learn more about

802
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:12,399
this topic or your work please um go

803
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:16,200
ahead and share oh this is this is

804
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:20,400
perfect uh because um my team is putting

805
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:22,759
together um hemp entomology website um

806
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,639
through my lab uh website it's almost

807
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,800
ready to go it's essentially a curated

808
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:31,199
curation of all the reli you know

809
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,400
reliable resources for um pests and

810
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,318
diseases including some of our latest

811
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,960
research one thing we're planning to do

812
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:41,079
is have a newsletter to

813
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,199
Growers both cannabis and hemp uh we're

814
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,720
going to put put that out through this

815
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:48,000
is the Colorado Department of

816
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:50,639
Agriculture newsletter and so we get all

817
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,639
the hemp registrants but I would love to

818
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:56,719
reach the Cannabis industry so they can

819
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:58,440
you know um inter have more interaction

820
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,439
with the UN University folks who are

821
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,280
actually doing this this research with

822
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,280
um you know um for the betterment of The

823
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,200
Growers for the scientific um um

824
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:14,319
intellectual Merit of it um so once we

825
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,879
have we are still um finalizing some

826
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:18,639
aspects of this website but it's

827
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,599
essentially a way to just disseminate uh

828
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,679
our you know the current knowledge get

829
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:25,000
it out of the grow I would love to send

830
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:27,399
it to you and maybe in this stock have

831
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,358
it there so Growers can sign up uh for

832
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:34,000
for all the News latest research in my

833
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:36,239
lab and um you know other collaborators

834
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,280
lab so they don't have to go reading

835
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:42,000
scientific papers so that I'm I'm EXC

836
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,200
excited about that we are continuing to

837
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,960
work on the virus Vector interaction as

838
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,480
um I have already mentioned to you the

839
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,480
other interesting uh aspect is the seed

840
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,159
transmission which is probably very

841
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,039
surprising to everybody right to find

842
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:03,358
out that it's what over 80% seed

843
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:07,000
transmitted in hemp wow um and not seed

844
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:10,920
transmitted in hops the the first uh

845
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,760
host um so we are trying to look into

846
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:17,200
that and understand um the mechanism a

847
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,839
little better because right now I I

848
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,679
don't think any of the hemp is being the

849
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,679
seeds are being tested for you know

850
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:27,919
certification or

851
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:30,519
um what do you say um state um State

852
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,920
tostate trans Transportation so it could

853
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:37,639
become a big issue if we don't do

854
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,119
anything proactively wow you said 80% I

855
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:42,440
think so I'm I'm pretty sure it was it's

856
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:48,160
staggering in uh in

857
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:51,318
hemp so um so I think having um

858
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,879
certified seeds clean stocks start clean

859
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:58,279
would be the way to go and so the lines

860
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,160
we used in my field study the the high

861
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,400
CBD that was clonally propag propagated

862
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:06,039
came from a tissue culture lab so we

863
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,639
knew it did not have anything and so

864
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:11,318
with the seeds we made sure we tested to

865
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:13,920
make sure that they were in fact

866
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:18,039
negative but not to say that there are

867
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:23,680
um potentially hemp uh out

868
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:26,279
there that has H excellent all right

869
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:28,239
