1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,919
for a warm welcome here in boston

2
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,279
good morning everybody it's an honor to

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,600
be here

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:19,600
i got into the medical cannabis field

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,840
because of a friend who was sick my

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,880
background is pediatric emergency

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,000
medicine

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:28,000
which i did for about 13 years in the

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,240
los angeles area

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,159
busy hours working at night taking care

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,679
of pretty sick kids in the inner city

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,640
and east l.a

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,840
and then i had a small child at home and

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,719
i was burned out

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,320
and so i took time off and at that time

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,800
you know we all say things happen for a

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,719
reason

18
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,038
a friend of mine contacted me who was

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,759
sick and said i want to use medical

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,039
cannabis

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,799
and i was utterly ignorant i had no idea

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
i remember the college days and after

23
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,359
that i had

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
no experience so i decided to do my

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,320
research

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
and i started reading and because i had

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,879
time on my hands i was able to read

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,400
a lot of the scientific literature and i

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,799
was blown away

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
and i said i'll help you and then when i

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,600
decided to go back

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,200
to practice i decided to transition into

33
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,879
the medical cannabis specialty and that

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,719
was in 2008

35
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,158
and i really haven't looked back since

36
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,319
then

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,840
i take care of both adults and children

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,478
and because of my pediatric background

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:32,640
i in the past three years and again part

40
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,640
of that too because of dr sanjay gupta's

41
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,359
documentary have had an incredible surge

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,359
of

43
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:44,640
pediatric patients seeking care

44
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:47,759
unfortunately california has the

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,599
reputation of the wild west and i

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,200
would say that without regulations there

47
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,118
it is kind of hard to practice but what

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,880
i'm going to tell everybody is that

49
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,560
my patients are getting medicine my

50
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,319
patients are getting better my patients

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,320
have better quality of life

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,718
and so the rest of the country it is

53
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,559
imperative that we follow or the rest of

54
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,598
the country follows california

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,318
we have a lot of things that we can do

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,919
better there

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,679
and i think that we're working on it

58
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,439
with the government's

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
now stepped in a little bit to help

60
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,878
regulate i think people in the industry

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,040
are starting to recognize

62
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,679
that they have to sell self-regulate i

63
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,759
heard dr mushulum say yesterday medical

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,680
and recreational need to be separated

65
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,919
absolutely a hundred percent

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,879
they both need to be available in every

67
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,199
state

68
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,878
uh in this great country of ours uh we

69
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,958
need to lead the way for the rest of the

70
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,560
world because this is a plant

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,479
that has some incredible properties and

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,598
in a country where we allow people to

73
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,238
drink alcohol

74
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,518
and smoke cigarettes i mean really we

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,560
have to look at ourselves and say what

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,719
are we doing

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,719
so without further ado i'll just move on

78
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,959
here

79
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,878
so i just decided to make a list of

80
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,479
diagnoses of the patients that i see in

81
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,719
my adult patients this is just some of

82
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,598
the more common diagnoses

83
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,519
as you can see it spans just about

84
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,000
everything

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,519
in one day's time i can see patients

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
with

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,680
10 different organ systems involved and

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,759
so

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
again going back to the endocannabinoid

90
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,158
system being involved in all of these

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,400
illnesses

92
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,919
that's why it works you know even my own

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,519
attorney says oh you think it cures

94
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,119
everything and i said no it doesn't but

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,640
you have to look at where the endocannab

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,439
where the cannabinoid receptors are

97
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,359
located

98
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,280
and that will help lead you to

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,200
understand what's going on

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,878
with these illnesses with pediatrics

101
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,798
as you can see it's just a handful of

102
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,560
diagnoses by far

103
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
it's the patients that i see with

104
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,920
treatment resistant epilepsy

105
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,560
i'm seeing a lot more patients with

106
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,000
autism and i think john did an

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,759
excellent uh talk about how

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,438
this is such a devastating disease for

109
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,000
families that really impacts the quality

110
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,598
of life for

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,360
everybody think about siblings who

112
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:03,679
are living with this who struggle to

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,680
just go to school they have a sibling at

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,519
home that they're terrified of

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,680
this is something that definitely needs

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,719
to be addressed

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,760
advanced cancer in pediatrics which is

118
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,199
heartbreaking

119
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,279
and then i've been seeing a fair amount

120
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,319
of patients with severe psychiatric

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,879
disorders and also

122
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,240
pandas which i'll go over only a few

123
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,918
patients with that but i've had very

124
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,240
good success in just that handful of

125
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,399
patients

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,400
the rationale for you for cannabis use

127
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,519
in uh pediatrics is that

128
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,519
over the past decade or so uh uh with

129
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,279
thanks to many of the researchers

130
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,120
that are looking at endocannabinoid

131
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,239
dysfunction there is some scientific

132
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,759
scientific evidence showing that these

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,918
patients are having manifest

134
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,960
manifestation of endocannabinoid

135
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,959
dysfunction

136
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,079
if their endocannabinoid system is not

137
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,918
working

138
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:57,599
we are seeing illness also with

139
00:04:53,918 --> 00:05:01,279
cannabis if you look back throughout

140
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,199
time going back even to the mid-1800s

141
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:08,559
there are reports looking at the safety

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,560
of cannabis there was one that

143
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,478
uh british

144
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,159
uh researchers went to india to look at

145
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,399
the safety it's a really interesting

146
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
report from 1894

147
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,519
and then there's been multiple repo

148
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,679
reports after that

149
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:26,560
of the safety profile this is safe

150
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,918
of course with children i like medical

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,639
supervision but

152
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,839
um there's no question that uh cannabis

153
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,400
in general is uh

154
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,079
quite well tolerated and certainly safer

155
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,000
than most of the medications that we're

156
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,918
prescribing to children

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
quality of life of course is very

158
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,038
important

159
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,560
when you have a child who's ill and the

160
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,759
parents in the audience who have an ill

161
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,199
child can tell you

162
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,720
quality of life is terribly impacted

163
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,720
when it comes to some of the cancer

164
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,039
patients or

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
some of the patients with epilepsy who

166
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,639
have a

167
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,599
terminal genetic disease just

168
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,319
compassionate care and end of life

169
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,199
importance there and there's no question

170
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,840
that that helps people get through that

171
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
in california of course we it since 2012

172
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,079
we've been able to test the quality of

173
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,839
products does it have a ways to go yes

174
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,439
and certainly after kevin's talk i've

175
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,799
learned a lot more about testing for

176
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,759
microbial

177
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,600
organisms but we do have the ability to

178
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,840
test so that patients can

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,280
be somewhat assured that the medication

180
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,159
that they're getting is

181
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,758
is clean and then of course research is

182
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,680
still desperately needed

183
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,759
there's a lot of research coming out now

184
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,439
the fact that we're all here today

185
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,680
looking at this

186
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,680
is absolutely inspiring to me i've met

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,319
so many people who are interested and

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,680
intrigued by this plant and all of us

189
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,439
need to

190
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,240
really go out there and spread the word

191
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,240
and lead the way

192
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,319
so what i did with my practice since i

193
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
have a lot of time today i decided just

194
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,400
to kind of collect my data

195
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,639
and so i looked at my patients who came

196
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,239
to me with treatment resistant epilepsy

197
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,319
they had to be on at least three months

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,360
of oil and some of them were even on oil

199
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,160
a year or even

200
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,360
two years and it's a whole plant oil

201
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,560
extract

202
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,560
and i was able to get results from 201

203
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
patients that responded to the um

204
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,519
to my emails and i the age range was

205
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
five months to 18 years and just people

206
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,279
always ask me how many patients do i

207
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,038
have i over over probably 300

208
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,079
plus uh pediatric patients using

209
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,279
cannabis

210
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,879
right now um and 200 responded to about

211
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,079
201 responded to

212
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:43,199
the email so average number of

213
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,959
um anti-epileptic drugs tried prior to

214
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,038
coming to my office

215
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,159
was 12 and there was a range of two

216
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:53,279
drugs all the way up to 22.

217
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,960
the average number of drugs that they

218
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,038
were taking at the same time

219
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,000
as they started cbd was three with a

220
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,240
range of zero to

221
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,959
seven there were 15 patients in this

222
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,560
group who were not taking

223
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,959
any other drugs at the same time that

224
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,598
they started cbd which definitely in my

225
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,038
experience makes it easier because of

226
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,319
the drug interactions

227
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,159
and then i listed the common

228
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
comorbidities i mean these patients have

229
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,439
a lot of challenges global delay

230
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,918
cp autism cortical visual impairment

231
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,839
feeding difficulties and so on

232
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,279
so it's not just one thing necessarily

233
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,000
that we're looking at counting seizures

234
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,198
we're also looking

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,479
at are these other

236
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,959
issues being improved by

237
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,839
cannabis as well and then the strains

238
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,759
and the cbd to thc ratios

239
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,839
varied charlottesville is a fairly

240
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:45,278
common medicine for patients to use and

241
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,680
it's about a 27 to 1 cbd to thc ratio

242
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,120
and then various preparations of ac dc

243
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,120
which is

244
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,159
available in california and i will tell

245
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,278
you that i've been doing this eight

246
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,439
years now

247
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,480
when i first started nobody even talked

248
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,680
about cbd

249
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,480
and really until about 2012 2013

250
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,439
is when we started talking about it and

251
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,920
literally

252
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,000
because of the push of families to get

253
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,120
access to this medication

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,919
um in the past year and a half it went

255
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,000
from one

256
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,240
product available to now at least

257
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,320
probably 10 or 12 products available

258
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
for people to try that are clean and

259
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
tested and in general

260
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,838
fairly so far fairly safe for my

261
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,399
patients

262
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,519
and here i made a chart of the the

263
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,679
results that i've seen

264
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,278
so as you can see some patients did have

265
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,799
worsening seizures and

266
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,639
we like to attribute that to drug

267
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,240
interaction but two of these

268
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,559
eight kids actually were not on any

269
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,320
medication so there's no question

270
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,239
that some of these patients do not do

271
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,519
well with cbd

272
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,879
no response in this particular group was

273
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,720
six

274
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,559
and i do know that i have a higher

275
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,680
number than that that did not respond to

276
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,919
my emails

277
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,679
so it's hard to say necessarily that's

278
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,199
the exact number i do believe that it's

279
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,439
a little bit higher than that

280
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,839
what's interesting is that i had about

281
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,600
28 patients um that responded who

282
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,399
reported that there was no reduction in

283
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,159
number

284
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
of seizures but they had a reduction in

285
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,439
the severity and the duration with

286
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,240
cognitive improvement and many of them

287
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
report that

288
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,278
you know because the seizures aren't so

289
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,000
bad we don't have to go to the hospital

290
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,000
as much

291
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,159
we're not using rescue medicine as much

292
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,679
and that again is an improvement and

293
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,958
remember these are people who are living

294
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,278
with seizures

295
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:27,119
sometimes in uh dozens of seizures a day

296
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,240
some even have hundreds of seizures a

297
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,839
day who are now saying we're having some

298
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,759
improvement in the quality of life

299
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,160
because we're not in the hospital

300
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,919
every four weeks and again the

301
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,919
disruption to family life when you're in

302
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,559
the hospital all the time

303
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,838
and it's funny because one of these uh

304
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,359
one of my patients is actually doing

305
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,880
quite well when the family came back for

306
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,200
a recheck just recently

307
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,720
and i said well just you know tell me

308
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,320
negatives positive whatever and the

309
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,759
first thing the father said is

310
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,040
i don't have to take care of the kids

311
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,559
because my wife is sitting in the

312
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,159
hospital with the sick one

313
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,679
and so that was huge to him that was the

314
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,278
number one thing

315
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,359
and they have five kids so it's very

316
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,519
hard when one parent disappears for a

317
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,320
week to go into the hospital

318
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,519
and then as you can see the range of 25

319
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,079
to 49

320
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,959
and again this is based on parents i ask

321
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,799
them to

322
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,639
keep a log to keep a calendar some of

323
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,799
them are very good at it obviously

324
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,879
it's hard to keep track of every seizure

325
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,958
but at the same time we have to

326
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,320
trust the families to be able to give us

327
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,119
a legitimate

328
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,720
number i do find that the families when

329
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
it doesn't work

330
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,480
they share that with you this is a

331
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,919
costly medicine in california it comes

332
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,759
it's out of pocket and when it's not

333
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,000
working i hear about it

334
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,720
so i do feel that it's uh somewhat

335
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,120
reliable data here

336
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,560
as you can see of the 27 seizure-free

337
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
patients remember these are children who

338
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,759
were told there is nothing else we have

339
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,480
nothing to offer you

340
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,919
um here's 27 families that now have a

341
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,839
child that's seizure-free

342
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,159
eight are actually pharmaceutical free

343
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,839
as well the rest are still weaning

344
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,919
about 40 percent of my patients have

345
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
been able to wean one or more

346
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,399
medicines sometimes it's only five

347
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,439
milligrams of a drug sometimes it's

348
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,440
50 percent of the medication the weaning

349
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,160
of drugs takes a long time for many of

350
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
these patients

351
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,078
they remember you can be seizure free

352
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,838
and then if you start messing with some

353
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,759
of the

354
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,440
aeds what happens is then you start

355
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,120
having seizures so many of the families

356
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
have actually chosen just to stay right

357
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,200
where they're at leave the drugs on

358
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,759
board

359
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,440
and let their child out grow the dose

360
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,799
and because they just feel that they're

361
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
in a good place and they don't they're

362
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,359
terrified to lose the effect

363
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,199
um in terms of negative side effects the

364
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,320
only two really that that popped up in

365
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,399
this were drowsiness and diarrhea

366
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,000
the numbers are small of course the

367
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,039
drowsiness may come from

368
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,799
if we're using very high doses or also

369
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:52,240
i find certain medications like clobazam

370
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,278
and others increase this uh the sedative

371
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,720
effect

372
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,399
and then if you look at the positive

373
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,879
side effects this is where parents

374
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,839
on the survey really just kind of went

375
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,919
uh nuts

376
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,839
writing things more alert better mood

377
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,679
better sleep more energy

378
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
better response to therapy and as you

379
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,559
can see and i put in quotes able to

380
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,078
argue one parent

381
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,559
actually complained to me that their

382
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:16,078
child stopped being wasn't as compliant

383
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,919
because he um was less drugged up and

384
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,439
more with the program and now he cared

385
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,958
if you put his shoes on and gave you a

386
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,399
hard time about putting his shoes on

387
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:26,078
when they left the house

388
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,200
so to me that's called a normal child

389
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:32,239
and parenting is part of that

390
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,160
no er visits less need for rescue

391
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,440
medication some of my families actually

392
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:40,399
measure you know they used to use

393
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,160
rectal valium six times a month and now

394
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
they've only used it once in the last

395
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,600
two months so to them they can see that

396
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,360
that's their objective because sometimes

397
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,959
it's hard to again to count seizures or

398
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,800
clusters

399
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,159
and then i have two patients that also

400
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,919
have uh

401
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,600
type one diabetes um who also the

402
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,679
parents reported that it appeared that

403
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,560
the glucose became more stable after

404
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,638
and you know that's unclear if it's a a

405
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,000
metabolic issue or if the child is not

406
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,000
seizing so much that you have better

407
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,078
control of the of the

408
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,198
glucose in my experience um

409
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,439
each and every patient is an individual

410
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:20,078
and will respond everybody says what

411
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,199
dose what dose there is no one dose

412
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:27,039
for every patient it is just like

413
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:30,719
everything in medicine it needs to be

414
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,399
personalized i usually start at about a

415
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,199
a half a milligram per pound or one

416
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,360
milligram per kilo per day

417
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,039
every eight hours i do find that in the

418
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,039
beginning every eight hours works better

419
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,559
some patients are able to go to every 12

420
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,000
hours if they've been successful and

421
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,479
they've been on the oil for quite some

422
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,919
time and then i just increase slowly

423
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,440
every couple of weeks

424
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,319
i stay in close contact with the

425
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,959
patients so that we can

426
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,639
titrate up and find the dose again

427
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,479
because it's expensive oil i don't want

428
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,000
to leave them on a sub-therapeutic dose

429
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,920
for three months and then check on them

430
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,240
then it doesn't make any sense to me

431
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,120
to do that we just kind of start going

432
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,959
up

433
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,560
and the average dose as you can see is

434
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,319
between five and eight i have a lot of

435
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,838
patients under that that do well

436
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,000
some patients are over that that are

437
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,600
doing well but on average i would say

438
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,278
the majority of patients fall between

439
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,879
that range

440
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,399
in california because there's many

441
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,078
different preparations if it's not

442
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,600
working you can change strains you can

443
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,159
change ratios

444
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,079
i have not found patients once they find

445
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,838
their dose that seems to work they don't

446
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,758
develop tolerance to it it appears that

447
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,399
they're able to stay at that

448
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,079
dose however this interesting phenomenon

449
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,198
has come up and some somebody asked a

450
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:42,078
question of dr mushulem yesterday

451
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,599
this terminology called cbd saturation

452
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,439
has come up

453
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
and it appears that for some of the

454
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,759
patients if they've been on the oil for

455
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,240
quite some time

456
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,839
if the child starts having more seizures

457
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,879
out of the blue they've been doing well

458
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,240
all of a sudden they start having

459
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,679
seizures they're not sick

460
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,600
they haven't leaned medication that

461
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,559
doesn't appear to be anything else

462
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,480
sometimes you know we somebody came up

463
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,319
with this term cbd saturation but really

464
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,680
the idea is that you maybe don't need so

465
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,000
much and we've been able to actually

466
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,599
back

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,759
down on dose and what's happening is

468
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,759
that the children respond to that i've

469
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,919
i've lowered dose in at least 25

470
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,120
patients and everybody says oh no you're

471
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,639
going to lower the dose what's going to

472
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,320
happen but they actually do well and

473
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,000
they stop having

474
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,839
the clusters of seizures that kind of

475
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
came out of the blue

476
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,079
another thing we're using in california

477
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,199
is thca which is a non-psychoactive

478
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,879
raw uh form of uh cannabis it wasn't

479
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,799
really readily available until about

480
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,799
maybe one or one and a half years ago

481
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,559
i've seen a fair amount of patients get

482
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,439
seizure reduction especially for drop

483
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,679
seizures

484
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,360
and just to mention cost in california

485
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,159
is an issue this is out of pocket

486
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,600
and the medication is can be expensive

487
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,039
especially if it's based on weight

488
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,079
and you have a large size child teenager

489
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,919
or so it can get very expensive now john

490
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,719
covered autism so i'm not going to go

491
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,838
over that

492
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,920
too much but i will tell you that

493
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,400
i'm getting some very good results there

494
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,918
is one human study showing that children

495
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,240
with autism have

496
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,038
increased cannabinoid receptors and the

497
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,640
question is is what does that mean

498
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,480
and how do we translate that but it

499
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,400
appears that there is some

500
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,838
dysfunction in the endocannabinoid

501
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,000
system

502
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,678
i have probably 70 plus autistic

503
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,038
patients in my practice

504
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,319
i again did a survey and i had 27

505
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,558
patients

506
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,399
parents who responded between children

507
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,639
between the ages of 3 and 18.

508
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,559
i did have some patients with cbd they

509
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,640
were over stimulated it they just became

510
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,759
more aggressive more agitated sleep was

511
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,000
disrupted

512
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,160
a handful of patients it didn't work and

513
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,279
about 17 out of these 27

514
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,558
the parents did report some improvement

515
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,759
um with calmer behavior and really the

516
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,599
big thing was a deuce

517
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,919
reduced aggression and that's very

518
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,558
important as john spoke about

519
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,840
and for many of my patients the

520
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,160
self-injurious

521
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,599
behavior is very difficult i've had

522
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,000
patients come in with

523
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,079
pillows wrapped around helmets mouth

524
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
guards all kinds of things

525
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,480
and if we can get that reduced it would

526
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,558
just mean such incredible

527
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,000
quality of life improvement i do find

528
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,839
that these patients don't need very

529
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,519
high doses you can do anywhere from one

530
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,359
to three times a day dosing

531
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,000
i listed the popular strains there and

532
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,759
again high cbd can be stimulating some

533
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,720
of these patients really respond very

534
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,798
well to combination cbd thc and

535
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,839
different ratios ten to one five to one

536
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:31,599
one to one

537
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,359
and so what i often do is have a

538
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,480
separate bottle of cbd and a separate

539
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,159
bottle of thc and

540
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,279
allows the parents to personalize the

541
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,240
medicine for that child

542
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,200
for pediatric cancer as you can see i've

543
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
listed here

544
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,120
you know a lot of the side effects i

545
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,120
look at at cancer in two ways one is

546
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,199
you're treating symptoms associated with

547
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,879
the cancer itself or the treatment

548
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,640
and then also i have some patients that

549
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,360
come to me who have exhausted every

550
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,038
option

551
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,959
they've read on the internet that

552
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:02,000
cannabis may fight cancer

553
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,079
and so again because cannabis has been

554
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,119
available in california now 20 years it

555
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,759
has

556
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,639
medical approval many of these patients

557
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,079
are accessing high dose oil and i'm sure

558
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
somebody today is going to talk about

559
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,279
this a little bit more

560
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,330
but what's interesting about this is

561
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,399
that i've actually seen some really

562
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:20,720
[Music]

563
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,320
very good results and on this slide i

564
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,480
talk about

565
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,119
i refer you to this one particular case

566
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,599
report that was published in 2013 of

567
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,558
this

568
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,199
cannabis extract for use in a uh 14 year

569
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:33,119
old

570
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
who had a terminal acute lymphoblastic

571
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,359
leukemia with terrible

572
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,880
genetics she after four years was sent

573
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,479
home

574
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,640
without any treatment in the parent this

575
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,720
was in canada and the parents obtained

576
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,799
some cannabis oil untested they had no

577
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,079
idea what they were giving her

578
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,519
but the doctors were able to follow her

579
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,759
blood work and remember with

580
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,759
leukemia you can draw blood and you can

581
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,359
follow the leukemia cells in the

582
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,960
bloodstream and they basically did it

583
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,119
every three to five days

584
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,480
and when they started and if you you go

585
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:07,199
to the slide or the study

586
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
you'll see that as the leukemia cells

587
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,720
dropped as the oil went up and it was a

588
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,038
clear-cut dose response curve in a

589
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,319
this is just you know a case report but

590
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,158
it did clearly show

591
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,359
uh two things one she wasn't on any

592
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,679
other medication

593
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,519
and because of her severe illness they

594
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,320
cannot attribute this to spontaneous

595
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,918
regression

596
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,079
so it was clear-cut that the cannabis

597
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,400
oil was doing something for this patient

598
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,558
i have a case report of a 16 year old

599
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,559
who came to me a year ago april with a

600
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,918
stage four osteosarcoma

601
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:41,279
metastatic to lungs to lots of different

602
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,000
areas of bone and they came in referred

603
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,678
in by an oncologist so bravo to her for

604
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,200
sending the patient to me

605
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,480
and we started very low dose cbd thc and

606
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,798
we went very high

607
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,880
we have no clinical trials i have no

608
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,639
idea about dosing i don't want to under

609
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,600
dose and cannabis is fairly well

610
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,679
tolerated

611
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,519
and the parents were willing to kind of

612
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,960
push the dosing

613
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,759
and he started cannabis oil in april

614
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,159
2015

615
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:12,319
and in july 2015 he had pet scan ct

616
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,600
mri and a bone scan all negative for

617
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,839
disease

618
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,839
which is really incredible

619
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,440
he had repeat scans in november which

620
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,960
were negative i called his oncologist

621
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
and i said what do you think and she

622
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,240
said well he should be dead

623
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,319
and i just saw him last week his hair's

624
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,880
growing back he's off chemo

625
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,798
he's a little bit beat up from his uh

626
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,799
three years of chemotherapy

627
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,119
um but he's back in school and he's

628
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:45,038
doing really well

629
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,839
and there is a he was on gem cytobean

630
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,480
and i just

631
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,000
put the study on here uh for about the

632
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,720
first eight months of his

633
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,359
um treatment he was on gem cytobean

634
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,679
which

635
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,158
is in one study synergistic with

636
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,038
cannabinoids to increase

637
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,720
cancer killing so you know i am flying

638
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,038
blind a little bit in a lot of these

639
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,038
patients but it appears so far that

640
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,640
we're getting some good results i never

641
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,839
say cure with cancer because i don't

642
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
know but i definitely say extension of

643
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,720
life

644
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,798
and then i've been given the uh sign to

645
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,240
get off the stage here so i'm just going

646
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,679
to real quick just say cannabis

647
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,480
treatment of pediatric psychiatric

648
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,480
disorders

649
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,319
these are usually very severe cases that

650
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,400
come to me this is not just simple my

651
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,720
kid has anxiety

652
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,519
and usually patients have tried multiple

653
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,440
things

654
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,839
and it's pretty much the same you start

655
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,720
low dose i prefer to start high cbd to

656
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,879
low thc

657
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,798
because again developing brain and we

658
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,120
just kind of titrate up and if we have

659
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,639
to we had very tiny amounts of thc just

660
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,239
to play with it a little bit and see

661
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,320
what's tolerated and i've seen some very

662
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,000
good results

663
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,399
pandas if you're not familiar is

664
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,960
something that is still

665
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,880
probably under under diagnosed pediatric

666
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,720
autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder

667
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,320
associated with strep infection so what

668
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,960
happens in some patients is they get

669
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,240
this

670
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,480
strep infection that basically causes a

671
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,558
dysfunction in the immune system that

672
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,640
creates a psychiatric condition and

673
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,720
parents say my kid went crazy

674
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
and nobody relates it back to the strep

675
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,519
but now we're starting to see that

676
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,440
there's this relationship

677
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,279
i've had three cases in my practice and

678
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,880
i've had very good results all

679
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,879
responding well to cbd rich cannabis oil

680
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,880
it's just an n of three but it's a place

681
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,360
to start

682
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,039
patients uh the parents report that they

683
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:34,479
feel like their child is uh

684
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,798
coming back to normal and so

685
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,720
that's very important um for those of

686
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,918
you who are making products for children

687
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,200
who are uh

688
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,759
who want to be uh part of the answer um

689
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,278
to this uh predicament we have with

690
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,960
cannabis in our country

691
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,038
i've listed here the most important

692
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,798
things that i see cannabis oil has to be

693
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,599
concentrated for children you cannot

694
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,798
give

695
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:59,199
a child 300 milligrams

696
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:59,839
when it's got four milligrams in one

697
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,440
teaspoon

698
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,879
how many teaspoons a day is that child

699
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,320
going to have to take so it has to be

700
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,880
concentrated

701
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,319
consistency and strain if a family finds

702
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,760
a strain that works

703
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,200
they don't want to go back next month

704
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:12,960
and hear oh gee you know what we didn't

705
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,720
grow that one anymore we have a new one

706
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,240
that's not an answer for a family who

707
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,480
has a very sick child

708
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
laboratory tested goes without saying

709
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,319
affordable

710
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,278
and then a reliable supply you can't go

711
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,960
back to your

712
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,240
supplier and they say oh we sold out of

713
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,679
that one why don't you try something

714
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,359
else that's not going to work for these

715
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,278
families

716
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,839
and then this is the best slide of all

717
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,519
these are all some of my patients

718
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,038
one of my patients went to venice beach

719
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,879
and put cannabis glasses on her

720
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,440
child who is seizure free and

721
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,480
pharmaceutical free after 13 years of

722
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,400
struggling with

723
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:50,640
seizure disorder i love that and um

724
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,200
this is i just want to say this is

725
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,919
what keeps me going is these kids right

726
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,319
here

727
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,200
and if you ever kind of get discouraged

728
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,200
by

729
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,319
what's going on with the government or

730
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,798
someone in your way

731
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,639
just try to focus on these families and

732
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:15,440
continue to move forward

733
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:15,440
thank you
