1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,689
I wanted to spend some time just opening

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,240
up some of the background behind this so

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:09,509
as I had just mentioned we've been doing

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,030
a fair amount of sequencing and trying

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,289
to de-risk what has been I think

6
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,910
affectionately termed lately

7
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,009
surveillance capitalism where we're all

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,960
finding our data is getting harvested by

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,179
other entities that might house that

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,640
data and sometimes being used in ways

11
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:25,198
that we're not all excited about this

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,310
certainly has happened in genomics over

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,500
and over again we've seen this with

14
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:29,939
23andme we've seen this with a variety

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,058
of companies and sometimes it's

16
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,259
completely voluntary and the the terms

17
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:35,759
and conditions are really clear about

18
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:37,619
this and there's there's there's

19
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,969
actually some informed consent that goes

20
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,409
on at other times there are very long

21
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,370
terms and conditions that people click

22
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,289
through and don't realize what their

23
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,128
data is going to get used for and so we

24
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:45,238
thought this would be a helpful

25
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,799
discussion to light of what we've seen

26
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:48,779
recently in the cannabis industry we've

27
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,640
certainly seen a few companies in the

28
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,320
space collect data from people under the

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,149
intent of helping them only to then turn

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,679
around and compete with them and this

31
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,929
got a lot of discussions brewing about

32
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,579
well should we be patenting our work and

33
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,019
should we be putting an open source and

34
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,618
which models are going to work for the

35
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,719
cannabis industry as we see in different

36
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,760
types of capital investment coming to

37
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,289
the end of the field traditionally we do

38
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,760
see a lot of capital investment coming

39
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,520
in that works on the paradigm of

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,290
patenting things and and and getting

41
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,868
things through the sec and that being

42
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,159
publicly traded and that those change is

43
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:21,750
very different than the cannabis

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,310
industry that has been around for the

45
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,109
last 80 years where there has been a lot

46
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,490
more sharing going on and sharing

47
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,079
thoughts and sharing genetics and

48
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,000
everyone working off of the shoulders of

49
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,739
somebody else so I wanted to spend some

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,299
time just at first just to introduce the

51
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,349
panelists here and let them each

52
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,460
introduce themselves you get

53
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,019
understanding of the type of people

54
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,879
we've collected to discuss this topic

55
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:43,530
and I think I'll start with my left here

56
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:45,658
with with Trevor thank you Kevin hi my

57
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,189
name is Trevor Wicky I'm the executive

58
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,130
director of the Calaveras cannabis

59
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,589
alliance I am a second-generation

60
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:54,780
cannabis farmer I've been growing for my

61
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,649
entire adult life for the last 20 years

62
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,359
and my primary passion through the

63
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,060
entire time that I've been cultivating

64
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,099
has been breeding in genetics I was

65
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,359
handed marijuana botany when I was 16

66
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,549
years old and

67
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:14,129
given that as my introduction into

68
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,439
cannabis cultivation and so when Kevin

69
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,599
extended an invitation to come down and

70
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,729
talk about the future of cannabis

71
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,400
genetics and the implications that it

72
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:25,949
has in terms of cultural resources

73
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,849
genetic resources and how that's going

74
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:32,789
to impact traditional cannabis producers

75
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:36,120
I jumped at the opportunity I'm grateful

76
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:38,129
thank you for the invite and there's a

77
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,800
lot going on in the space right now and

78
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:44,009
I think that this is really cannabis

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,950
genetics as Kevin just pointed out are

80
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,959
incredibly plastic there is a unique

81
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:53,039
genome that we're working with here it

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,259
is very under understood we have a

83
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,319
limited knowledge base here and I think

84
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,799
before we rush off and start tinkering

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,969
with things we should sit back

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,590
understand what we're dealing with and

87
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,770
understand the long-term implications

88
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,509
for the genome and for the people who

89
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,850
have produced this plant and have

90
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:15,859
dedicated their lives to it for decades

91
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,859
and generations so that's why I'm here

92
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,930
thank you so much my name is Janine

93
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:27,150
Coleman and I'm the executive director

94
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,239
and founder of origins Council which is

95
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,180
a nonprofit organization devoted to

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,030
establishing legal Geographic indication

97
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,860
protections for cannabis in support of

98
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,409
sustainable economic development for

99
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,820
cannabis producing regions I'd like to

100
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,680
take the opportunity to offer a brief

101
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,180
introduction to Geographic indication

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,900
systems for those of you that are not

103
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,900
familiar with them

104
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:54,629
Jia's or a legal standards based

105
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,640
designation that are awarded to products

106
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,560
of place products that you're familiar

107
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,439
with it that where geographic

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,530
indications are champagne Bordeaux Parma

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,379
ham tequila and these designations

110
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,840
recognize and codify regional

111
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:13,079
intellectual property rights of

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,300
producing regions and these intellectual

113
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,639
property rights are tied to region

114
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,609
specific agricultural practices

115
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,560
and product quality standards there's a

116
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,990
number of deliverables tie to Geographic

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,449
indications first and foremost they're a

118
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,908
regulatory framework and so the

119
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:33,020
designations are awarded by a regulatory

120
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:36,269
agency and they're therefore carry the

121
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:41,698
authority and the enforcement capability

122
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:42,930
of a regulatory agency so they're very

123
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,478
strong they have a lot of legal

124
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,650
strengths and the associated standards

125
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:52,709
are framed around product quality and

126
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:55,529
therefore they they are very strong and

127
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,899
building consumer loyalty and can be

128
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:01,529
very strongly leveraged for market

129
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,908
differentiation because the designations

130
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:06,029
are place-based there's a number of

131
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:08,339
deliverables to the region with respect

132
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:10,709
to standards protections for the

133
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,598
environment as well as building the

134
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:14,968
renown and reputation of the region

135
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:18,139
which can drive economic development

136
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:20,848
opportunities such as Agri tourism

137
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:24,090
Geographic indication systems have

138
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:26,250
tiered designations I'm in California we

139
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,888
have two designations that have been

140
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,050
created in state law we have county of

141
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,348
origin for cannabis and appellations of

142
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,168
origin and just to give you a sense

143
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:38,218
County of origin is technically a

144
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:40,049
indication of source and so there's

145
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:41,639
really no standards associated with it

146
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,129
other than it was produced in the

147
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,079
designated region appellations of origin

148
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:47,879
by contrast have a lot of standards

149
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,588
associated with them because the

150
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,468
designation is really awarded to

151
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:55,288
products that can that can prove that

152
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:56,899
there is a essential link between the

153
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:59,370
quality of the product and the place

154
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:02,278
inclusive them environmental factors and

155
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,560
also the practices of the farmers and so

156
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:07,860
as Trevor spoke to there are an enormous

157
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,658
tool to really protect genetic resources

158
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,528
as well as cultural resources of the

159
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:15,810
community so I'm very excited to present

160
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:18,408
today and talk about how this ties into

161
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,050
protections for cultivars and

162
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:24,259
particularly legacy producing regions

163
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:31,400
and I thank you all for having me here

164
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:35,300
I am Dale hunt I'm a plant scientist and

165
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:37,759
a patent attorney and I founded a law

166
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,360
firm earlier this year called plant and

167
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:45,289
planet law firm I think I'm here because

168
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:50,330
I know about patents and I think that's

169
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:52,189
why I was invited I have worked in well

170
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:54,769
a little bit of background my bachelor's

171
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:57,589
degree is in botany master's in genetics

172
00:06:54,769 --> 00:07:00,979
and I did a PhD in molecular and cell

173
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:02,779
biology studying seed development then I

174
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,620
went to law school because I knew by

175
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:08,029
then I didn't want to be a professor and

176
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,480
since I finished law school I've worked

177
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:13,069
in a few different law firms

178
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,250
representing plant breeders among other

179
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:17,540
different kinds of companies in

180
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,389
connection with the work I've done with

181
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,700
plant breeders I have helped them

182
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,860
identify appropriate strategies for

183
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,389
protecting their genetics and for

184
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,020
commercializing them all over the world

185
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,979
I think we've probably done

186
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:32,509
commercialization agreements and

187
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,509
protected intellectual property in at

188
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:38,060
least 20 countries probably closer to 30

189
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:44,300
over the the 23 years that I've been

190
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:46,220
doing this I was kind of I got into the

191
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,670
cannabis industry by being asked if I

192
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,040
would consult on legal topics for a

193
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:55,790
group that was looking at IP policy as

194
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,890
it related to cannabis and then since

195
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,230
then I have gotten more and more

196
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,139
involved in the industry and now

197
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,689
consider that the work I do with plant

198
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:07,129
breeders is probably the well it's

199
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:09,469
definitely the most exciting work that

200
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,509
I've ever done and I consider it the

201
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,390
most important work that I've done I

202
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:17,060
believe that you know may elaborate this

203
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:19,250
on this later but I believe that the

204
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,990
kind of old-school self trained plant

205
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,899
breeders that are passionate about

206
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,060
cannabis and that each have their own

207
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:30,859
collections of genetics they've

208
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,629
developed and seeds and plants that they

209
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,250
have collected and received from others

210
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:40,610
I believe that constitutes the greatest

211
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:44,320
army of R&amp;D that the world has ever seen

212
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,610
in terms of really meaningful

213
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,100
developments on the frontier of Medicine

214
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,019
and I think it's one of our challenges

215
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,879
to figure out how to tap into that army

216
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,730
instead of having it become left behind

217
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,070
in the in the industrialization of of

218
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:04,100
cannabis and the the big money aspects

219
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:05,960
of cannabis so that's become sort of a

220
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,300
cause for me and it's also something

221
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,030
that I'm very excited to talk about and

222
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:15,769
write about and I'm glad to be here

223
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:17,569
with the rest of the panel hello

224
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:21,319
everyone my name is Christian saucier

225
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm the founder and principal consultant

226
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,480
at crypto tech guru on this panel I'm

227
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,389
the only one who doesn't know much about

228
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,850
genetics apparently I'm here for

229
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:35,059
information science a lot of what we've

230
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,200
heard even this morning when we were

231
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:38,359
talking about the need for more

232
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,190
information more clinical research you

233
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,830
just mentioned all the little farmers

234
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,920
they have information right now that

235
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:48,980
could save lives and we just don't know

236
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,229
how to aggregate it my expertise over

237
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,980
the last five six years has been to

238
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,930
apply what I'll call this peer to peer

239
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,269
consensus protocol we know it has

240
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,799
blockchains

241
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:02,779
applied these technologies these new

242
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,179
formulas to reach an understanding

243
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,189
between people who don't know one

244
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:09,469
another and that's the magic of it in

245
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:12,410
the way applying that to other

246
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,750
industries one a more successful space

247
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:17,029
in their applied it to fruits and

248
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,070
vegetables having sensors in the field

249
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:22,149
following the product all the way to the

250
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:25,640
restaurant using these technologies

251
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:28,009
fisheries I mean it could be applied to

252
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,759
many things obviously but cannabis is I

253
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:33,799
believe one of the most exciting

254
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,840
opportunity for the blockchain space

255
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,500
forget Bitcoin this is the growing

256
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,410
industry

257
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,169
and the cannabis industry has a need to

258
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:46,469
better share or share information in

259
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:48,539
better ways and when we do that we also

260
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,879
want to make sure we recognize where the

261
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:53,370
information comes from you know the two

262
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,399
generation farmer and the lawyers the

263
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:59,519
the labs there's a lot of players and

264
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,649
you just can't expect there to be heavy

265
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,829
contracts between all the players and

266
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:06,659
the industry so that's where some of the

267
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,460
information technology that I believe

268
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,169
they can bring here to the table and I'm

269
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,740
looking for and looking forward to speak

270
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:15,990
to you guys about it excellent so I

271
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,690
think it's it's pretty apparent with

272
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,009
with the recent vitamin e acetate

273
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,200
outbreak if you want to call it that

274
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:24,509
that traceability of products is

275
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,580
becoming increasingly clear we it's

276
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:29,159
still unclear to me where these things

277
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,780
came from and how they got into the

278
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,730
testing or through the testing systems

279
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,589
that we have and one of my reasons for

280
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,420
wanting to invite Cristian on here with

281
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,220
with Jeanine is that this sounds like

282
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:40,139
appellations to me you and you know your

283
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,290
grower and you know what their methods

284
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,939
are and of course bringing bringing Dale

285
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:47,279
and and someone who's actually growing a

286
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,020
plant here is I think very important in

287
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,919
the equation to understand how do we

288
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,449
build these things so that they're

289
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,849
protectable and that the small farmer

290
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,860
does not in fact get gets squeezed out

291
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,740
of this based on the the bud light if

292
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,180
ocation of cannabis if you will do you

293
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,830
want to touch on just maybe the

294
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,379
background on the different flavors of

295
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:09,240
IP that are out there that that people

296
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:11,639
can consider sure if you are someone who

297
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,980
has a cannabis plant or cannabis

298
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,960
genetics and you want to protect it the

299
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,370
first question is how are you going to

300
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,259
commercialize it because there are

301
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:23,730
different forms of protection available

302
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:26,370
for cannabis each of which can be

303
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,259
completely ineffective if if it's not

304
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,240
aligned well with your commercialization

305
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,819
strategy so if you're selling clones

306
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,700
then you really really need a plant

307
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,900
patent a plant patent is a form of

308
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,890
patent protection that is like a

309
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,840
copyright on a plant it only protects

310
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:45,929
asexual propagation or only it it's only

311
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,480
infringed by asexual propagation of a

312
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:50,370
particular cultivar so if you're making

313
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,080
clones that's your form of protection

314
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,389
on the other hand if you're selling

315
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,009
seeds a plant patent doesn't really give

316
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,139
you any effective protection except

317
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,939
perhaps to give some protection if

318
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,949
you're if you have some important

319
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,350
parents of those seeds and you you may

320
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,810
well want to protect those parents with

321
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,089
a plant patent so the alternative is

322
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:12,989
something called a utility patent it

323
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:15,029
treats the plant as more of just any

324
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,389
other kind of invention and it lets you

325
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:20,990
claim the protection for the plant by

326
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:26,460
way of protecting of claiming its seeds

327
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:29,430
it's any kind of it's progeny using the

328
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,160
plant variety and a method of breeding

329
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:35,909
it can protect extracts of the plant and

330
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,709
so on so for example if you want if your

331
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,230
business is all about extracts and

332
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,540
you've got some really great underlying

333
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:46,680
genetics you would need a utility patent

334
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:49,259
to really protect that so and then for

335
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,079
people in the hemp space there's a newly

336
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:56,278
available kind of protection provided by

337
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,200
the USDA it's not new to other players

338
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,528
in the seed industry but it's new for

339
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,160
cannabis the USDA plant variety

340
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:08,370
Protection Act permits protection of

341
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,649
seed propagated varieties and since the

342
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,789
passage of the 2018 farm bill it also

343
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:17,639
protects a sexually propagated varieties

344
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:21,539
the tricky part of that is that if you

345
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:24,179
want to file a USDA PvP application you

346
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:25,679
have to submit a seed sample and those

347
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,079
seeds have to be seized that the

348
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,179
government can legally accept so that's

349
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,680
only applicable currently to industrial

350
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:36,479
hemp that's not available for high THC

351
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,979
cultivars so coming back to that if

352
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,690
you've got seeds you want to protect and

353
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,269
they've got high THC you've really got

354
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,190
to get a utility patent most of all just

355
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:45,779
call somebody who knows what they're

356
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,259
doing and they can help you out

357
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:51,139
[Music]

358
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:53,839
and how do we bring appellations into

359
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:55,879
this and that if you want to have a song

360
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,559
if you want to have it if you've grown a

361
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:01,298
plan let's say in humble County or

362
00:14:57,558 --> 00:15:02,928
Mendocino that's you unique terroir the

363
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,188
Appalachians aren't necessarily a

364
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:05,899
recognized form of intellectual property

365
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:08,629
at the USPTO but they're certainly

366
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,578
legally recognized as something with

367
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:12,019
with with weight to them what how does

368
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:19,399
one go about choosing each of these

369
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:22,009
paths you want to take yeah it's a

370
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:24,259
journey with respect to policy and

371
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:26,509
starting you know California has an

372
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:28,699
amazing propensity to really set the bar

373
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:31,970
with respect to a policy reform for

374
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:34,659
cannabis so we do have in state law and

375
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,059
the California Department of Food and

376
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:39,409
Agriculture a free work to support

377
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:41,328
Geographic indications for cannabis and

378
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:43,629
so working on appellations of origin and

379
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:46,668
as I mentioned we have county of origin

380
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:49,009
there is case law with American

381
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:50,509
viticultural areas which are the GIS

382
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:53,600
that we have in the United States for

383
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:55,850
wine that GIS are very strong with

384
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,459
respect to the protections associated

385
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:01,158
with them and in fact take precedence

386
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:03,858
over trademarks so there are some some

387
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:07,609
pretty rigorous protections that we can

388
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:11,089
start to build upon and Pollard's policy

389
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:13,729
reform is simultaneous right now there's

390
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:15,499
work happening today in fact at the

391
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:16,639
United Nations with consideration of the

392
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:18,579
World Health Organization's

393
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,239
recommendations to reschedule cannabis

394
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:23,478
the World Intellectual Property

395
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:26,418
Organization is looking at some of these

396
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:30,019
protections with respect to cannabis for

397
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:32,208
genetic resources cultural resources and

398
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:34,668
also cannabis is a traditional medicine

399
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:37,099
and so I think between what California

400
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:38,899
is doing to set precedents around GIS

401
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,788
and what is happening on the

402
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:43,759
international level there's a pressure

403
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:46,698
that's going to really unfold with a

404
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,188
national level of policy reform and

405
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:51,159
there's some bills that have recently

406
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:53,679
passed

407
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:57,360
both Oregon and and being entertained in

408
00:16:53,679 --> 00:17:00,339
California with respect to trade between

409
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,560
legalized States and so how we can start

410
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,779
to fold some of these policies into

411
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,149
those types of agreements and really

412
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:09,809
further the policy pathway for

413
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:13,269
Geographic indications for cannabis I

414
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:15,639
think what we've seen also in the same

415
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:18,129
in the same vein and the food business

416
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:22,240
which is similar when you look at labels

417
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:25,480
like organic Fairtrade and and very many

418
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,700
you know labels out there you never know

419
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,450
for sure right the package has a stamp

420
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,549
but really the evidence is is what you

421
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,730
know would prove that this is organic or

422
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:39,819
Fairtrade and today that evidence is

423
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,470
very very difficult to get right there's

424
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:43,480
organizations obviously that are

425
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,279
defending these labels right so that

426
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,370
organic still means something to

427
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,839
consumers but even the people in charge

428
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:51,339
of defending these labels and I've

429
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,109
talked to many of them are are little

430
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:56,619
freaked out because it's really hard to

431
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:58,889
defend these these labels the evidence

432
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:01,359
that can be brought to bear that I

433
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,970
cultivate this plant according to

434
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,039
organic or did I you know transport it

435
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,779
in the right you know environment right

436
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,609
humidity and all the things that we need

437
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:13,649
to know about the products at the end of

438
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:16,959
the supply that information can be now

439
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:18,759
captured and moved in parallel with the

440
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,590
product we're good moving product

441
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:23,740
obviously our supply chains can move

442
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:26,230
information it can move product but the

443
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,029
information gets tampered with in

444
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,549
between and sometimes by something that

445
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:33,190
might not be fair trade so a way to

446
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,289
defend these is to have a system an

447
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:38,170
information system that allows

448
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:40,779
throughout the supply chain the ability

449
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,640
to capture data that can be seen as

450
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,049
evidence that the farmer have an organic

451
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,810
or some some other you know

452
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:49,720
accreditation by the right accreditation

453
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:51,819
body and if not that that is a piece of

454
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,100
information that could be known if we

455
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:54,759
knew how to convey the information with

456
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,319
the product

457
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,390
I think we're Christians trying to say

458
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,279
he may not realize that no one ever

459
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,480
counterfeits anything in the cannabis

460
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,528
industry

461
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,360
how would how would you feel about an

462
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:09,319
Appalachian clearly you're in a district

463
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:11,878
that will probably be one right yeah

464
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:14,099
Janine and I were both on the state

465
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:16,528
working group and we discussed with

466
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:19,138
state regulators the rollout of the

467
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:21,440
Appalachia program I see this as an

468
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:23,819
opportunity for us to create

469
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,190
intellectual property rights that are

470
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:28,019
community property rights and not just

471
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,269
necessarily property rights that are

472
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:33,419
held by individual corporations or

473
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:36,480
individual private entities by having

474
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:39,600
GIS and community-based Appalachia

475
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,190
systems producers come together and this

476
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,949
is honestly the only place that

477
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,288
California's regulatory system actually

478
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,319
gives control and local control to

479
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:51,538
cultivators licensed cultivators get to

480
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,509
come together establish standards

481
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:56,669
procedures and cultivars now this is

482
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:58,710
incredibly important there are people in

483
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:01,440
my County in my area who have been

484
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:04,288
cultivating and breeding for decades and

485
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,600
generations those particular cultivars

486
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:10,470
that they have bred in these areas are

487
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:13,069
unique and specific to our area and it's

488
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,450
our job to try to come together and

489
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:17,700
establish these norms and procedures

490
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,798
around these cultivars to protect them

491
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,440
the Legislature's done a good job by

492
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,839
giving the cultivators and the licensee

493
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,230
is the actual opportunity to establish

494
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:31,378
these standards procedures and cultivars

495
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:34,829
and so for me I think that this is a

496
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:36,839
unique opportunity for us to be able to

497
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:40,259
preserve and protect the value that

498
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:42,720
we've created in the preceding decades

499
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:46,019
and generations before legalization came

500
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,579
into effect I also think that what

501
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,528
Christian brought up is incredibly

502
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:53,668
important one of the things that we need

503
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:56,490
to do is establish the scientific basis

504
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,799
for demonstrating that there is a unique

505
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,138
and uniform product that we are

506
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,788
producing in our particular geographic

507
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:05,308
regions we need to differentiate that

508
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:08,279
between our region and other regions I

509
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:11,720
live in Calaveras County it's on the

510
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:13,980
it's in the Sierra Foothills so our

511
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,230
environment is incredibly different

512
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,298
relative to the Emerald triangle it's

513
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,788
much more arid it's almost semi desert

514
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:23,220
we're going to have very different

515
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:25,349
outcomes even with the exact same clones

516
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,720
than they're going to have simply based

517
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:31,529
on the environmental effects of our area

518
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,509
and so a particular clone grown in the

519
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:35,639
Emerald triangle verse a particular

520
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:37,200
clone grown in Calaveras County even

521
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,150
though they're the exact same genetic

522
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,940
material produces two two different

523
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:45,120
outcomes these are ways that we can

524
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:48,360
through the data and through the science

525
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:51,149
of it doing lab testing doing genomic

526
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:53,639
testing and also collating all of this

527
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,320
data and aggregating it within the

528
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,450
appalachia system we're going to be able

529
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,119
to prove that there are unique distinct

530
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,130
outcomes that are tied to place and that

531
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,558
are tied to the cultivars that we have

532
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:09,539
traditionally bred this is something

533
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:11,460
that is going to essentially once we

534
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,619
move into a much more uniformed

535
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,659
commodities market the thing that's

536
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,269
going to differentiate products within

537
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:20,669
the future cannabis space is going to be

538
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:23,490
the ability to create value-added and

539
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:25,890
differentiation between products and a

540
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,380
Palacios are going to be one of the key

541
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,840
basis is for us to do that and the

542
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,270
science is going to be absolutely vital

543
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:36,240
being able to track all of it back and

544
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,740
to demonstrate that this plant came from

545
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,019
this place was grown with these

546
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,779
practices and we have the data to show

547
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:44,429
that this has actually happened that's

548
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:47,579
what's going to create the value-added

549
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:49,740
because if somebody's just producing a

550
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:53,129
clone and not living up to the standards

551
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:55,500
that are set and established and the

552
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,630
unique outcomes that are tied to those

553
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,589
standards and practices then we're going

554
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:05,010
to see the devaluation of these unique

555
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:07,079
areas of traditional cultivation so to

556
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:12,058
my mind the appalachia system creates

557
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:14,399
the most open and community-based system

558
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:18,389
for developing and

559
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:22,230
I pee for cannabis it allows the

560
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:25,410
consumers access and information to the

561
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:28,289
actual data and it provides the

562
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:30,029
cultivators and the traditional

563
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,470
producers a means and a mechanism

564
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:33,329
through which to demonstrate and

565
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,430
differentiate their products from other

566
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:38,519
products that may be mass-produced or

567
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:40,110
may not live up to the standards as if I

568
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,389
could comment it as long as we're

569
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:45,089
talking about the way things could be

570
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,680
done in the future one of the things

571
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:48,709
that's a real problem right now is the

572
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,710
utter chaos around the naming of

573
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,460
different strains or cultivars and

574
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,759
correlating that back with anything

575
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,200
that's meaningful and so one of the you

576
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,480
know as long as we're putting things on

577
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,490
the blockchain I would love to see some

578
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,319
kind of a DNA fingerprint that says this

579
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,880
is the standard for this cultivar this

580
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,159
is what it really is this is how you

581
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,190
know that it is what you think it is and

582
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,250
then you know I can picture looking at

583
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:16,400
scanning a QR code and getting

584
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:19,140
verification that this cultivar is real

585
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,790
some information about the appellation

586
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,160
these are different layers of value if

587
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:27,569
you have a genuine genuine genetics

588
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,210
cultivated in a certain place under

589
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:33,960
certain conditions and they move yeah

590
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:37,710
move through the supply chain in certain

591
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:40,170
ways that assure the quality then you've

592
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,180
got a lot more protection for the

593
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,820
consumer and you can ask a higher price

594
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,279
so a premium farmer premium genetics

595
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:49,649
doing everything right ought to get a

596
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,359
much higher price yeah yeah I want to

597
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,880
add to that because this is what really

598
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,859
reminded me of what Christian was doing

599
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,410
at a company called ripe that I oh is

600
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,059
that traditionally like seed to sell

601
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,350
tracking has become the sturdy work now

602
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,240
in the cannabis industry and I think

603
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:05,459
it's mainly a dirty word because the

604
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,440
databases are centralized and the people

605
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,720
harvesting that data aren't necessarily

606
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,309
delivering any of the rewards of that

607
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,319
information aggregation back to the

608
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:15,210
people who delivered the data and what

609
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,799
we're seeing now in many other genomic

610
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,240
industry is there's a company that

611
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,829
George church has recently founded

612
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,079
called nebula genomics and what they're

613
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:22,689
attempting to do is invert the model of

614
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,308
genomic

615
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,369
aggregation of information from the

616
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:29,558
23andme model which is very centralized

617
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:31,209
to giving the access and the keys that

618
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:32,888
DNA sequence information on a blockchain

619
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,538
to the patient's the patient's can opt

620
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:36,158
in and decide to sell that data to Roche

621
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:37,868
if they want to and the patient gets the

622
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,220
reward not necessarily the central

623
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:41,168
aggregator of that information

624
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,669
well there's ways that this can be done

625
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:43,809
in the food industry that I want to

626
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,369
throw the ball to you Christian because

627
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:47,558
I think you've seen this happen before

628
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:50,168
there's some challenges doing it yeah no

629
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:52,658
they definitely are maybe the first

630
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:54,399
concern about this blockchains to be

631
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:57,820
addressed as the fear of all the open

632
00:25:54,398 --> 00:26:01,329
and the free and then the open block

633
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:04,778
chains are open indeed but the openness

634
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:07,778
is there for anyone to come into the

635
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:10,179
network right so the the farmer who does

636
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:11,558
not have a big brand can come into the

637
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,109
block chain network and say hey I've got

638
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:16,778
a unique product though so the openness

639
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:19,449
is in the accessibility of you know

640
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:20,979
collaborating on the network once on the

641
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,098
network the block chain and that's what

642
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:26,348
we did for food it can be very private

643
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:28,479
right you can be anonymous even in some

644
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:30,638
cases if that's what the the industry

645
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:31,960
needs so the private deals in the

646
00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:34,719
exchange of information between

647
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,940
commercial parties the building of

648
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,819
commercial brands and reputation all of

649
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,849
that is is very available on these open

650
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:44,979
blockchain now specifically to what

651
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:48,428
you're talking about Kevin yeah the food

652
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:50,798
and even the wine business are ahead of

653
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:52,330
cannabis on in this particular space and

654
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,579
we're already seeing a number of

655
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:57,220
commercial players including one of my

656
00:26:54,579 --> 00:27:01,239
own startups right right dot IO that

657
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:04,149
looks at the traceability problem the

658
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:06,098
trust problem is there evidence that you

659
00:27:04,148 --> 00:27:09,939
know this Colombian coffee was grown

660
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:12,368
again in fair trade practices and these

661
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,778
questions are you know it's new

662
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:16,089
technology I'm not gonna you know

663
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:17,288
suggest that these networks are super

664
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:19,628
well-established but there's many

665
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:23,019
commercial partners right now that are

666
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:27,058
building competing blockchains for the

667
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:29,589
dissemination and the certification of

668
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:30,549
information that comes with your stake

669
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:32,919
or which you

670
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:36,039
fish or with your cannabis or with

671
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,750
anything so it it's really something the

672
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:40,329
industry needs to look at that there's

673
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,819
other industries that have faced very

674
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:45,149
similar problems this one is it's more

675
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:48,279
exciting because there is a tradition of

676
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,070
the small farmer doing it prior to

677
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:52,690
legalization and that tradition needs to

678
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:55,649
be preserved that tradition built this

679
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:59,740
industry so we need to have an

680
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:02,350
information system and a certification

681
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,529
process that respects you know these

682
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:08,980
pioneers that actually built the

683
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:12,039
medicine that were we're looking for I'd

684
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:14,529
like to speak to enforcement because and

685
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,970
and by that I mean enforcement of the

686
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:17,500
certifications and the standards

687
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,170
associated with it because that's really

688
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,390
where the rubber meets the road we're in

689
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:24,970
very early iterations of track and trade

690
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,740
systems for cannabis I would say this

691
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:30,210
cautiously that there is a benefit to

692
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:33,069
prohibition and that the rigor of of

693
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,950
intent behind track and trace will drive

694
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:37,779
I think more accountability with respect

695
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,970
to those systems developing for cannabis

696
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:42,039
but additionally with Geographic

697
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,930
indications what you have is you have

698
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:49,269
regional shared byun shared motivation

699
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,250
shared intellectual property rights and

700
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:53,889
so there's a motivation on the part of

701
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,779
the designated community to really drive

702
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,940
the enforcement of their own standards

703
00:28:55,779 --> 00:29:00,039
as well to maintain the quality and

704
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,860
reputation of their product and so

705
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:05,440
there's kind of a very unique and I

706
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:07,839
think powerful dual enforcement

707
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,160
mechanism with respect to Geographic

708
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,889
indications because you have that

709
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:14,620
community buy-in to really ward off

710
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:17,050
counterfeit products and to really

711
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,789
adhere to the quality and standards that

712
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:20,789
you have communally created and so I

713
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:24,399
think it's a really kind of powerful

714
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:26,139
differentiator for Geographic indication

715
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,300
systems with respect to where the rubber

716
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:32,920
meets the road with enforcement of

717
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:34,750
standards I also want to throw this back

718
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,610
to Dale a little bit in regards to

719
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,710
patent pools I'm hearing a lot of terms

720
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:40,389
like community genetics and community

721
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,840
information and I know there's another

722
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,850
mechanism that you've been think

723
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:48,139
on how to create patent pools that might

724
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:52,129
be able to maleic asymmetric warfare in

725
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,990
the intellectual property space that's

726
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:58,460
me my parents would be so proud I'm all

727
00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:01,160
about asymmetric warfare now yeah one of

728
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:04,039
the questions I am asked most often as a

729
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:07,370
patent attorney by growers and breeders

730
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:10,369
is can Monsanto make me stop growing my

731
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:13,489
own plants and of course the answer to

732
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:16,909
that is no but there's a little bit of a

733
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,740
yes the know is if they're your own

734
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,960
plants and you've got them and they

735
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,420
predate anybody else's patents or

736
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,000
whatever then then in terms of patent

737
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:28,550
protection no one can come in and tell

738
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,410
you to stop growing your own plants the

739
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:33,859
way it works in the real world in some

740
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:37,779
other in the commodity AG space is that

741
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:41,479
a company that has vast access to

742
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:44,149
technology and money can make better and

743
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,370
better seeds that it better in terms of

744
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,320
not necessarily taste or anything but in

745
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:50,659
terms of productivity in terms of you

746
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,029
know how many dollars can you squeeze

747
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,730
out of an acre of land or a growing

748
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:57,649
season and they can build some of those

749
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:00,650
technologies right into the seeds and if

750
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:03,350
you're a commodity farmer you end up

751
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:06,200
facing a choice of either buying the

752
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:08,929
seeds from that source and growing them

753
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,450
with enough efficiency that you can sell

754
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:14,180
them for less or for more than it cost

755
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,400
you to produce them or your other

756
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,310
choices to continue growing the seeds

757
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,790
you've always grown less efficiently and

758
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:24,710
face a commodity pricing structure where

759
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:27,920
it may actually cost you more to produce

760
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:33,019
your your product than you can sell it

761
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:35,740
for and in that way powerful technology

762
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:38,029
forces in a commodity market really can

763
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,990
put people in a position of either

764
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:44,029
adopting that technology or of going out

765
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:47,779
of business or losing money perpetually

766
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:49,690
so in response to those questions I

767
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:52,420
thought about that and I realized that

768
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,840
there's an analogy

769
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:59,259
well so obviously people want to be able

770
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:01,240
to have well one of the recommendations

771
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:02,710
is if you can stay out of the commodity

772
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,769
market because it really is hard to

773
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:08,880
compete in these economies of scale and

774
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:11,529
so directed to the small farmers who

775
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,290
still don't want to be sued for patent

776
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:17,109
infringement for some of the very broad

777
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:19,089
patents that have issued the analogy

778
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:22,329
that I drew from that is that in the

779
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:23,919
electronics industry we all hear about

780
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:26,559
the big lawsuits because they're really

781
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,050
really big but for the most part there

782
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,700
are companies that coexist by licensing

783
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:32,619
their technology to each other and just

784
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,850
agreeing not to sue each other because

785
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,339
they could sue each other into oblivion

786
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:38,289
they could be in court every day

787
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:40,599
the reason they breach these agreements

788
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,920
is because both parties have some

789
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:44,259
patents that the other party might

790
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,000
infringe and instead of just getting

791
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:49,629
stuck in patent litigation they cross

792
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,579
license each other and they coexist my

793
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,230
suggestion for the cannabis industry and

794
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:56,799
to protect the small farmer is to

795
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:59,860
establish some pools of patents and a

796
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:04,450
mutual defense organization of some sort

797
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:08,169
where anyone who gets sued for patent

798
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:10,779
infringement can tap into this pool of

799
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,519
all their their colleagues in that pool

800
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:15,430
the small farmers the small growers

801
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:19,029
small breeders and any patent that any

802
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:21,130
of them owns it might be useful in in a

803
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:24,099
countersuit or to assert against this

804
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,300
party that's it's threatened or has

805
00:33:24,099 --> 00:33:28,689
actually filed a patent infringement

806
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:31,659
case that whole community's patent pool

807
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,610
can be tapped into to to try to

808
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:37,690
counterbalance the the force of these

809
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:39,490
really big companies there are some

810
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,400
challenges with that but I do think it's

811
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:44,200
viable and I and some other people who

812
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,990
care about this are working on putting

813
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:50,680
this very thing together that would be

814
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:53,680
fund for patent defense so that the

815
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:56,039
small the small player isn't completely

816
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,039
out

817
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,430
outgunned in terms of firepower and

818
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:04,549
mounting a defense and challenging the

819
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:06,140
validity of an overbroad patent as well

820
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:07,549
as having a pool of other people's

821
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,769
patents that they can draw on in a

822
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:11,090
counter suit so there's there's still a

823
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:14,090
lot to be done with that it's nothing

824
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:16,280
that any one person or law firm will do

825
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,829
on its own but it is something I believe

826
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,110
needs to be done so that the community

827
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:24,549
of small farmers and traditional players

828
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:27,650
in the industry really have a chance to

829
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:30,170
to stand their ground in the face of

830
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:32,510
some very big very aggressive patenting

831
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:34,820
strategies okay so we're gonna open up

832
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,080
the microphones for questions and while

833
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,480
folks are kind of collecting their

834
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,659
thoughts on on questions there I did

835
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,579
have a question at least four Jeanine

836
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:45,829
how do you are there cases in the past

837
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:48,619
where people have protected champagne or

838
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:50,269
protected appellation branding in the

839
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,159
past and how have those traditionally

840
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:53,449
been litigated are those obviously

841
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,799
they're not litigated through any kind

842
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:56,569
of intellectual property court they're

843
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,640
litigated probably more through state

844
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:02,360
law or I don't actually know I'd love to

845
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:04,339
hear more about it well because the

846
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,470
designation is really codified and

847
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,860
issued by the regulatory authority that

848
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:12,709
really is then the opportunity to bring

849
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,070
forward claims of fraud right and so a

850
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:18,230
lot of how it's driven is really by

851
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:21,140
producers trade associations syndicates

852
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,690
and in France is what they're called and

853
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:26,420
so there's an element of self policing

854
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:29,539
and then an authority with which to

855
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,480
bring your claim forward and then for

856
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:35,239
the designation to be evaluated with

857
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,409
respect to standards adhere met and so

858
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,839
that's really generally how the

859
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:41,059
enforcement works with an appellation

860
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,530
system I think I see a question from

861
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:48,980
Brent yeah thank you this is great so I

862
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:51,500
get two to brief questions the first

863
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:54,969
rights the coattails of Kevin's question

864
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:58,909
I hear a lot about

865
00:35:54,969 --> 00:36:03,079
geographic gie because i can't forget

866
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:05,598
the action and I hear allusions to

867
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,420
science where are we with any kind of

868
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,390
standard protocol for looking at what

869
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:15,280
would determine what what you're I mean

870
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:15,279
because what I'm hearing is essentially

871
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,070
you're talking about having a

872
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:28,489
essentially a biological marker of

873
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:30,588
epigenetics so what what are you using

874
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:34,279
for that and then you know the second

875
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:37,909
question is with respect to the idea of

876
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,859
a patent pool what about in the other

877
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:43,219
event where we're not looking where

878
00:36:39,858 --> 00:36:47,779
there's a clear patent infringement case

879
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:50,750
and where a patent defense fund could be

880
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:54,500
leveraged really to you know for the

881
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:56,949
benefit of the infringer could could

882
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,659
there be a backfire type situation there

883
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:01,608
okay I'll attempt to hit your first

884
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:03,440
question then hand it to they're

885
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:06,319
probably Dale for the IP side of things

886
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,289
but well one way of perhaps trying to

887
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,000
register where your genetics are is you

888
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:12,920
can get DNA sequence information fairly

889
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,900
cheaply now from the plant and then if

890
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,510
you can demonstrate a lot of photographs

891
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,608
on phones have geo tags embedded inside

892
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,830
the metadata of the image and so if you

893
00:37:19,608 --> 00:37:24,559
can if you can attach that image with

894
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:26,299
the geographic timestamp of it if you

895
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,059
will with the sequence information on

896
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,050
some type of blockchain to prove hey

897
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:32,210
this was grown in a particular

898
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,800
appellation there's perhaps ways of

899
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,280
circulating that information so that

900
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,769
it's immutable and it's on a distributed

901
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,510
public ledger that nobody can change but

902
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:44,320
in terms of the second question on

903
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:47,480
patents I'm gonna pass it over to you

904
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,550
yeah I I hope this is responsive to your

905
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,980
question I'm I didn't I'm not sure that

906
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:54,260
I got the full question if you'd like to

907
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,469
rephrase it you could or I can just dive

908
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,470
in

909
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,509
Oh York it's really bright up here

910
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:17,570
[Music]

911
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:19,429
I saw so in a case where yeah okay

912
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,230
the question was in a case where where

913
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:23,389
someone in this patent pool is

914
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:25,010
maliciously trying to infringe a valid

915
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:26,359
patent would it backfire and I do

916
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,090
believe so I think you'd have to have

917
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,710
exceptions you can't have bad faith

918
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:35,300
infringement of a valid patent this is

919
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:38,329
really about maybe two things the at

920
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:41,660
least one there there have been I want

921
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:43,429
to get to jargony or anything but to

922
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:45,199
give you that maybe the hopefully the

923
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:48,139
one minute version of patent examination

924
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:50,329
when you apply for a patent the patent

925
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:53,089
examiner's job is to look at what you've

926
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:55,369
claimed and find every reason that they

927
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:57,440
can for rejecting it that really is

928
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:59,719
their job it kind of protects the public

929
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,510
from guilt from granting unduly broad

930
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:05,959
monopolies the way they do that in

931
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:08,600
biotech or electronics or air airplane

932
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,940
engines or anything is they look on this

933
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:13,519
vast body of prior academic literature

934
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,470
prior patent literature and they can

935
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,699
find things that come pretty close to

936
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:18,619
what someone is claiming to have

937
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:20,329
invented and if they find something

938
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:22,549
that's dead on exactly the same they'll

939
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:25,909
give a rejection for lack of novelty if

940
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,810
it's just pretty close maybe that what

941
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:28,549
they're claiming is a trivial

942
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:30,139
modification over what came before

943
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:33,440
they'll give it a rejection for obvious

944
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:36,469
'no self in the space of you're a

945
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,869
cannabis patent examiner and this is an

946
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:42,079
industry that has a lot of commercial

947
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:43,969
activity but basically no significant

948
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,069
prior literature in terms of prior

949
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:48,109
patents or prior academic research

950
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:51,440
notwithstanding the beautiful work we've

951
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:55,070
heard spoken about today that is such a

952
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,539
a small number of publications compared

953
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,309
with the hundreds of thousands or

954
00:39:56,539 --> 00:40:01,179
millions of publications in some other

955
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:03,529
industries and they're pretty focused

956
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:06,940
fantastic but they're pretty focused so

957
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:09,280
if someone applies for a patent in the

958
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,929
space the examiner really is flying in

959
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,359
the dark they don't have the tools in

960
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:15,848
the literature to assess really whether

961
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:19,150
this claimed invention is new or not and

962
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:20,619
the result is that arguably there have

963
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,230
been some patents that have been granted

964
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:24,789
that have been unduly broad and the

965
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,349
place of burden on the industry because

966
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:31,300
they really cover things that are not

967
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:32,920
new if that's the case and I'm not here

968
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:37,810
giving a legal opinion but if that's the

969
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,519
case the community itself is the best

970
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:42,250
source of this so-called prior art

971
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,780
they'll be able to come especially if

972
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,849
they're if they consider themselves a

973
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,290
mutual defense organization of some sort

974
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:48,990
they'll be able to come forward with

975
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:51,550
their own evidence that this or that

976
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:53,529
chemo type has been around for a long

977
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,289
time and isn't really wasn't really knew

978
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,599
when this particular patent was filed

979
00:40:55,289 --> 00:41:00,009
that's just one example but yeah I would

980
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:02,710
never want to be part of something that

981
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,270
would defend a bad faith infringed er of

982
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:08,199
a valid patent this is really about

983
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:10,389
patents either that are there are over

984
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:12,039
broad and therefore invalid that cover

985
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:15,250
things that are not new or not that are

986
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:17,230
obvious or in some cases it can be that

987
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,639
someone does develop something great

988
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:21,960
let's say somebody comes up with

989
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,920
technology to make all cannabis

990
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,750
mildew-resistant everybody's going to

991
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,460
want to have that access to that and

992
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,909
this kind of patent pool might be able

993
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:32,858
to negotiate a group license in a way

994
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:35,019
that wouldn't be available to any

995
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:36,759
individual member of that pool so in the

996
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:38,469
case of a genuine invention that has

997
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,540
valid patent rights there can still be a

998
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:43,989
place for this kind of a pool and I hope

999
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:46,710
we can make it happen hi there I have a

1000
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:48,818
question in particular for Christian I

1001
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:51,639
was that answer does it okay if I go

1002
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:53,949
forward yes sorry yeah okay I come from

1003
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:57,818
that the food processing and agriculture

1004
00:41:53,949 --> 00:42:00,039
background and we were very involved in

1005
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:03,068
like using technology that came from

1006
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:05,050
Europe that was regarding traceability

1007
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:07,809
so forth like you could use a barcode

1008
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:09,670
and know who grew your meat what they

1009
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:11,349
ate what medicine they have and so forth

1010
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,690
and so on and the United States was a

1011
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:15,700
much farther behind and that in giving

1012
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,769
that accessibility to the consumer

1013
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,960
because of the EU and and

1014
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:21,909
differences of where the sources were

1015
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,159
coming in Apple eat all the things that

1016
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:27,849
you guys are talking about and how I in

1017
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:30,849
the cannabis sector in both the ahem

1018
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:34,839
side and on the THC side and I'm looking

1019
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:36,670
for that type of ability and I'm

1020
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,490
understanding now that the blockchain

1021
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:42,880
technology would give even a greater

1022
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:45,759
under a greater depth of traceability

1023
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,500
and chain of command so my question is

1024
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,790
is is that something that I've been

1025
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,039
trying to shop for this is that's

1026
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:53,800
something that I can actually go out and

1027
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,630
get like the right software the part of

1028
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,030
the chain of command or the blockchain I

1029
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:01,420
mean I how would I obtain that and use

1030
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:03,310
that in my business I think I should

1031
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,200
repeat the answer you gave earlier you

1032
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:07,179
know come talk to me afterwards we can

1033
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:10,449
talk about this there are a number a

1034
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:13,750
number of commercial operations that

1035
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:16,689
provide these services today we're all

1036
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:18,699
innovators in this room right so when

1037
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:21,159
you're the pioneer the blockchain space

1038
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:24,719
is also relatively new to new in ten

1039
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:27,909
year old industry governments you know

1040
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:31,899
companies and foreigners are all trying

1041
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:35,199
to figure out how do i tap into the very

1042
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,510
few new things that blockchains do you

1043
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,849
know blockchain is not the solution it

1044
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,080
is part of the solution for specific

1045
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:46,000
reasons traceability and Kevin said it

1046
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,679
earlier right it's a notarization of

1047
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,630
that traceability you can trace with a

1048
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,819
private database if you if you trust a

1049
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:54,550
company that owns a database it's it's

1050
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,870
cheaper than blocking but the problem is

1051
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,450
what you put if you don't trust

1052
00:43:55,869 --> 00:44:01,809
Monsanto's words right and that's where

1053
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:04,750
that traceability can be improved with

1054
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:06,429
these more open Network and again you

1055
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,380
got to be careful with how these words

1056
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:11,279
are interpreted open does not mean

1057
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,269
there's no room for commercial legal

1058
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,880
governmental and you have spoken

1059
00:44:13,269 --> 00:44:17,739
specifically and about food to the

1060
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,809
Canadian foods you know Inspection

1061
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:22,369
Agency and they were asking you know

1062
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:25,400
Walmart Loblaws

1063
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:27,139
some big fishery in Canada hey we need

1064
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,139
better traceability so next time there's

1065
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:32,179
a food poisoning event you know we can

1066
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:34,909
figure out where it's from quickly and

1067
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:36,440
at the end of the the conversation all

1068
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:38,149
these companies were all freaked out

1069
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,349
about how much it was gonna cost them

1070
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,700
and they were telling the Canadian

1071
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:42,710
government sorry we can't do this

1072
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:44,359
without help and then they say hey

1073
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:46,610
Christian maybe you know blockchain can

1074
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:49,820
help well they'll block trains gonna not

1075
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:52,070
gonna solve a hundred million dollar

1076
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:54,470
problem but it is gonna be part of the

1077
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:57,320
solution and the solution that it brings

1078
00:44:54,469 --> 00:45:00,679
is better transparency and better

1079
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:04,550
notarization of the information that

1080
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:06,079
you're viewing can it be conned hi can

1081
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,930
you cheat on the blockchain yeah yeah

1082
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,969
that happens to it if the product is not

1083
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:13,879
information in this case the product is

1084
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:15,679
a kind of cannabis so it is a physical

1085
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,930
product that can be a lie about the

1086
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,629
information put on the blockchain so

1087
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:22,969
there's a lot of aspect to this it's not

1088
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:26,030
a panacea but when you look at sites

1089
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:27,919
like canopy dia you can start small

1090
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:30,380
right you can start with a scan at the

1091
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,930
at the farm in a scan at the dispensary

1092
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,220
and maybe a scan of an employee and

1093
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:36,980
again all of this can be done very

1094
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:38,719
privately and in private systems but

1095
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,670
when you're trying to demonstrate that

1096
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,919
no this is the farm that's been there

1097
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:45,019
for four generations and they've been

1098
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,550
growing your good cannabis for you and

1099
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:48,949
you want to differentiate your product

1100
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,780
that's where I think these more public

1101
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:52,699
networks like blockchain systems can

1102
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,440
help yeah I'll just add to that real

1103
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:56,089
quick that there has been I was at an a

1104
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,929
OAC meeting recently where Frankie

1105
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:02,990
honest who's high up at the FDA was

1106
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:05,449
commenting on how it was taking in 60

1107
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:07,759
days to track dirty product like bad

1108
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:10,189
mangoes or something throughout the food

1109
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,680
chain that they currently have and so

1110
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:14,269
they got on board with a particular

1111
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:15,799
blockchain project known as hyper ledger

1112
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:17,900
and I'm not necessarily endorsing that

1113
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,070
as the particular solution here but they

1114
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,650
demonstrated they could get that

1115
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,870
sixty-two days down to like six seconds

1116
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:26,570
once they had everything bar-coded seed

1117
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:28,769
to sale as an experiment now they only

1118
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,450
had that running in one particular

1119
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:31,889
and obviously that has to get expanded

1120
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:34,019
to all foods and there's a lot of

1121
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:35,879
building and and engineering that needs

1122
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:38,699
to go on to scale this to multiple other

1123
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,890
industries but it's happening at the FDA

1124
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:42,210
level where they want block chains on

1125
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:43,559
everything and they want genetic

1126
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,750
signatures on everything so they can

1127
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:48,630
trace outbreaks and much more rapid clip

1128
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,469
I think the next question might be

1129
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,880
coming through there were having a hard

1130
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:52,169
time to see how people were responding

1131
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,510
to you in the wrong direction don't take

1132
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:57,960
offense right I'm on the right I have a

1133
00:46:54,510 --> 00:47:01,560
cyber question my background is in

1134
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:05,750
physical security so dealing with act

1135
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:09,960
physical access control video cameras a

1136
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:13,800
lot of our solutions have been moving

1137
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:18,539
towards the secure hosted phase so it's

1138
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,940
it's up in the cloud I know with Canada

1139
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:25,159
and the Patriot Act there's a lot of

1140
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:29,010
rules where if we work with any of our

1141
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:33,599
Canadian companies it has to be servers

1142
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:37,520
that are within Canada's borders outside

1143
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:41,639
of the US my question for cannabis is

1144
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:45,900
because it's not federally legalized do

1145
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:48,629
we do we have to consider where is that

1146
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:54,630
information stored so like for example

1147
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:57,960
if my organization isn't with this state

1148
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:01,340
that California does does my information

1149
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:05,269
have to physically reside in California

1150
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:08,329
how do we deal with that secure hosted

1151
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:11,130
I'll make a quick comment on the

1152
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:16,019
decentralized network protocols which is

1153
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:18,150
my specialty it is a it is a problem

1154
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:20,190
governance are struggling with right

1155
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:22,858
blockchain came about and now you can

1156
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,559
move more than $10,000 you know across

1157
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:27,059
borders without anybody knowing

1158
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,170
governments didn't like that right and

1159
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:30,960
that's why they're there they're trying

1160
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:34,059
to figure out how to legally categorize

1161
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,360
these new information networks

1162
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:39,730
that said well maybe maybe it's it's a

1163
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,519
good thing that the cost of transaction

1164
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:44,500
is being reduced by the cost of storing

1165
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,710
information in a specific place on

1166
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:50,050
planet earth should not be relevant

1167
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,730
anymore in the 20th century right

1168
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,289
because we have all sorts of ways to

1169
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:58,079
store information we can store

1170
00:48:53,289 --> 00:49:00,610
information in DNA so the these old

1171
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,529
approaches are changing its changing

1172
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:05,920
slowly obviously it's part of

1173
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:08,800
legalization and creation of zonings

1174
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,760
and-and-and cultivars now identification

1175
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,740
will take time but I think these kind of

1176
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:17,290
requirements will be relaxed over time

1177
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:23,529
simply because they're becoming I don't

1178
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:25,989
want to say obsolete but sorry so just

1179
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:32,050
from like a legal standpoint you don't

1180
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:34,029
you don't see worry I am NOT a lawyer so

1181
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,410
I'm always worried about legal that's

1182
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,090
why I call my lawyer when I need a

1183
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:38,259
lawyer

1184
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,570
you're correct no there's there's a

1185
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,090
danger there that I don't have a

1186
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:47,289
solution for it but the information will

1187
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:50,260
not stay on a database in California I'm

1188
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:52,869
not a lawyer but my reaction to that

1189
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:55,930
would be that the information itself

1190
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:57,819
isn't technically in violation of the

1191
00:49:55,929 --> 00:50:01,599
controlled substance act though that

1192
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:04,809
information could be used in prosecution

1193
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,389
if activities were violating the

1194
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:11,289
controlled substance act so as far as I

1195
00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:14,099
know like the information itself isn't

1196
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:19,029
the crime it's only evidence of a crime

1197
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:21,880
potentially so you're worried that the

1198
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:23,710
geotag to demonstrate your appellation

1199
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,099
points to your house that might be a bad

1200
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,099
idea

1201
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:34,319
hi my name is Jason I'm with Ocana I

1202
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:37,800
have a patent question I was reading

1203
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:42,269
last week that Charlotte's Web got

1204
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,870
approved for a point two seven THC level

1205
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:46,949
on

1206
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:49,139
CBD hemp strains and they're gonna

1207
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:51,649
supposedly gonna get approved for a

1208
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:56,549
utility pen here in the next few months

1209
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:59,010
what does that mean exactly the point

1210
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:03,510
two seven I might have a follow-up

1211
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:06,300
question yeah actually I was interviewed

1212
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:08,370
about this very thing by at least a

1213
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,130
couple of reporters a couple weeks ago

1214
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:14,159
this is big news I think the biggest

1215
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:16,050
concern arises from people not having

1216
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:18,449
clarity about what this actually covers

1217
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:20,700
and at least the plant patent that I

1218
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:22,439
looked at and that was the topic of the

1219
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:25,769
questions I addressed a couple weeks ago

1220
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,960
at least that plant patent is truly a

1221
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:30,000
plant patent which means the only thing

1222
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,760
it protects is if someone makes clonal

1223
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,800
copies of that exact unit type and so

1224
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:39,930
then the question is well why would they

1225
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:41,130
do that it may be that and this is all

1226
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:43,169
you know why would they choose to get

1227
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:45,809
that kind of patent if they're in the

1228
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:47,099
seed business then the only reason they

1229
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:48,690
would want to get that kind of plant

1230
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:52,829
patent is to protect the parent from

1231
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:55,289
being copied without permission they may

1232
00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:57,690
be selling clones and you think wow how

1233
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:59,579
would you sell clones of for hemp when

1234
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,470
you've got a farm and on such scale it

1235
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:04,319
who knows it I know that one of the

1236
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:06,209
biggest problems in hemp is if your THC

1237
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,240
level goes above 0.3 you've got a big

1238
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:11,789
problem and so maybe this is so stable

1239
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:13,979
so locked in at point 2 7 or lower that

1240
00:52:11,789 --> 00:52:16,980
it has enough value that people would

1241
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:20,130
would perform this using clones but

1242
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,840
bottom line is if the patent if it's a

1243
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:24,119
plant patent it will never protect more

1244
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,860
than one genotype if it's a utility

1245
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:30,609
patent you have to look at the way it's

1246
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:33,430
claimed and a utility patent

1247
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:35,769
would never be able to claim every kind

1248
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:38,259
of hemp that is below 0.3 because those

1249
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:41,920
aren't new but it could claim a

1250
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:46,630
particular cultivar that is the subject

1251
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:49,059
of a seed deposit and that if you are if

1252
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:51,039
you have something that that matches

1253
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:52,599
this cultivar in this seed department

1254
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:54,940
then you there this seed deposit then

1255
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:56,110
you would be infringing it I want to add

1256
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,490
one thing to that as well it's also

1257
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,599
important to know that plant patents

1258
00:52:57,489 --> 00:53:01,089
only cost about twenty five hundred

1259
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:02,980
dollars to file so that's a really tiny

1260
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,630
insurance policy for someone to protect

1261
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,909
against employees running out the back

1262
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:08,650
door with cuts and so they may viewed

1263
00:53:06,909 --> 00:53:10,000
that in light of maybe security cameras

1264
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,920
and then like this is a good thing to

1265
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,420
add on so that if anyone grabs a cut

1266
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,369
they know that we've got a plant patent

1267
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:17,079
we can then come after them with it's

1268
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:20,139
not a huge cost next to a utility patent

1269
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:22,389
which might be ten times more yeah it's

1270
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:23,889
it's can be as low as twenty five

1271
00:53:22,389 --> 00:53:25,569
hundred to file it to get it all the way

1272
00:53:23,889 --> 00:53:29,170
through the patent offices more but it's

1273
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:32,320
still around around 10k ten to twelve K

1274
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:37,860
usually is the average so so at point

1275
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:37,860
two seven they don't own every man

1276
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:49,609
thank you very much so many questions so

1277
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:54,309
little time can we speak to him

1278
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:59,269
pollen collection storage for a moment

1279
00:53:54,309 --> 00:54:01,009
my big quandary here is I know the

1280
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:03,769
datasets there is somewhere but they're

1281
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:05,870
practically impossible to find typically

1282
00:54:03,769 --> 00:54:09,320
what would be the moisture content in

1283
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:12,920
fresh hemp pollen how far do we have to

1284
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:16,160
and how safely can we di drape that down

1285
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:20,269
before we do not really long-term but

1286
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:22,159
safer in a few months - 50 C storage in

1287
00:54:20,269 --> 00:54:24,409
that fallen without degrading it or

1288
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:26,779
rupturing the capsules so that it's

1289
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:30,170
ready for pollination when we're when

1290
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:33,740
our plants are and then what stage do we

1291
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:36,680
have to re mooster eyes that pollen

1292
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:38,989
before we apply it I have seen some

1293
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:40,750
photos that shows that the pistil

1294
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:43,159
structure itself is capable of

1295
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:45,409
remoisturize in the pollen as it

1296
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:48,529
produces it's to to insert a C in a

1297
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:49,819
package but we've got a lot of money put

1298
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,830
in this and we don't want to try to be

1299
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:56,930
throwing shooting it in the dark thank

1300
00:54:51,829 --> 00:55:00,170
you that's you I don't have any of the

1301
00:54:56,929 --> 00:55:02,599
specifics at hand right now I do know

1302
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:05,510
that there are some published studies

1303
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:09,949
that address the issue of pollen saving

1304
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:12,380
and from personal experience low-tech

1305
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:15,109
and not doing any scientific studies I

1306
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:18,260
leave my pollen out for two weeks to dry

1307
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:22,550
and then I put it into fridge rated

1308
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:25,640
storage with desiccant and I leave it in

1309
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:29,690
my fridge for years and I've had viable

1310
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:31,730
pollen up to 12 months after I've stored

1311
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:35,059
it in that fashion

1312
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:36,800
it's not at all scientific or what

1313
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:39,049
you're asking but I do know that the

1314
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,970
data is out there and I believe I have

1315
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:43,580
some PDFs that I could share afterwards

1316
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:45,719
with you thank you because the industry

1317
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:47,788
is somewhat beyond

1318
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,230
our old styles are doing that now

1319
00:55:47,789 --> 00:55:52,049
exactly yeah

1320
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:54,960
you know this kind of information like

1321
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:57,210
this this particular you know experience

1322
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,858
practice that you you do about the

1323
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:01,170
pollen which I know nothing about so

1324
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:03,509
well I won't talk about that but the

1325
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:05,849
information that you have which was a

1326
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:08,130
question is really hard to connect you

1327
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:10,349
to right there's another farmer producer

1328
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:13,019
that needs to know what you know and

1329
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:15,750
this is where you know little excitement

1330
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:18,449
maybe we're beyond just traceability if

1331
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:19,949
we want to really engage some of the new

1332
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:23,279
dynamics with these peer-to-peer

1333
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:25,828
networks that information you you can

1334
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,900
put up for sale on these networks like I

1335
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:30,450
don't know how much that was worth but

1336
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,010
some of it is fractional you know you

1337
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:34,588
know fraction microtransactions

1338
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:37,349
fractions of pennies when was the

1339
00:56:34,588 --> 00:56:39,630
cannabis you know cultivated or or the

1340
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:41,430
harvest date right that that's a little

1341
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,079
piece of information and a lot of people

1342
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:45,929
will want to know down the supply line

1343
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:47,640
right the guy doing the oil the guys

1344
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:49,440
selling the oil the customer buying the

1345
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:50,940
thing everyone's gonna want to know you

1346
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,010
know the cultivar and a bunch of

1347
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,750
information to the extent where that

1348
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:57,059
information makes the practice better

1349
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:59,278
the farmer should be should have a forum

1350
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:01,619
to be able to brag about it in order to

1351
00:56:59,278 --> 00:57:04,019
raise the value of their brand of

1352
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:06,568
cannabis and if we can notarize that on

1353
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:08,670
a network then that becomes money in

1354
00:57:06,568 --> 00:57:10,829
your new money a new stream of

1355
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,809
information that doesn't come from the

1356
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:14,369
cannabis it comes from the information

1357
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:16,170
about the cannabis that you've been

1358
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:20,130
drawing the channel sell I really want

1359
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:21,720
to reinforce that topic because there's

1360
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,400
asymmetric information all over the

1361
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:25,439
marketplace whenever you find people who

1362
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,608
can share like this there's value that's

1363
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,740
created and it's like from our

1364
00:57:26,608 --> 00:57:30,869
perspective we would pay value or money

1365
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:32,489
make micro transactions what-have-you

1366
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:34,079
for people that supplied us with chemo

1367
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:35,759
types in addition to their sequencing

1368
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,559
and so instead of us trying to collect

1369
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,028
that stuff and harvest it on you and

1370
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,960
sell it to somebody else we'd actually

1371
00:57:39,028 --> 00:57:42,239
love to be able to have a blockchain

1372
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,949
that could give people credits if the

1373
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,659
strain they had in canopy dia was really

1374
00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:46,949
popular or sold a lot or had a chemo

1375
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:48,750
type and we could give them more

1376
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:50,338
frequent flyer miles to use more

1377
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,289
sequencing or use more of our products

1378
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:54,179
if we could actually capture some of

1379
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:55,349
that information and trade it so even

1380
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,848
though you might think of terpene

1381
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:57,530
profile on a plant as meaningless and

1382
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:59,210
not worth of

1383
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:01,250
it's valuable to other people who don't

1384
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:02,510
have access that information and if they

1385
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:04,070
could get on a network that could share

1386
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:06,080
it it would be it would be wonderful I

1387
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:07,850
think we have time for one more question

1388
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:11,779
over there before lunch breaks yeah I

1389
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:14,239
have a question for Dale and then a

1390
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:17,060
brief comment that and I can meet with

1391
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:19,399
you afterwards on with Janine and Trevor

1392
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:21,259
on the whole GI and Appalachian thing

1393
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,809
Dale thank you by the way we had the

1394
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:25,760
pleasure of meeting with you in Oregon

1395
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:26,840
and thanks for outlining the difference

1396
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,220
you've answered some of my questions

1397
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:32,630
already basic outline of plant pattern

1398
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:35,659
versus utility patent could you take a

1399
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:38,000
moment and just dive into the PDP and

1400
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:39,349
why it's good for him you kind of ran

1401
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,440
through that kind of quickly first of

1402
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:44,299
all what does that acronym mean again

1403
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:48,500
plant variety protection plant what

1404
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:53,590
plant variety protection pvp pvp yep

1405
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:55,849
I didn't enunciate well okay so the USDA

1406
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:59,090
to put a little bit of historical

1407
00:58:55,849 --> 00:59:01,759
context on it the the Congress passed

1408
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:04,579
the plant patent Act and I think about

1409
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,010
the 1930s but for some crazy reason it

1410
00:59:04,579 --> 00:59:11,090
only covered a sexually propagated

1411
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:13,900
plants trees vines things like that it

1412
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:16,850
did not cover seed propagated plants

1413
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:18,769
later on in about the 60s there was a

1414
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:20,809
worldwide movement for protection of

1415
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:23,750
plant breeders right or establishment of

1416
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:25,519
plant breeders rights and something

1417
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,380
called you paav was created which is a

1418
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,320
French acronym that basically means the

1419
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:33,230
Union for protection of plant varieties

1420
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:39,830
and/or of new varieties and eventually

1421
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:42,619
the u.s. joined you paav in gosh 70s I

1422
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:44,900
think maybe 80s doesn't matter we're in

1423
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:49,880
the were in the next millennium anyway

1424
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:52,280
but in joining you paav the u.s. limited

1425
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,079
its protection unlike the rest of the

1426
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,760
world that limit its protection just to

1427
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,539
seeds and that was to kind of fill the

1428
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:02,420
gap created by the plant patent statute

1429
00:59:58,539 --> 01:00:05,480
it was only last December that that gap

1430
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:06,030
was or that that limitation was removed

1431
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,380
and

1432
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:12,000
the USDA PvP can protect case actually

1433
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:14,210
propagated varieties although that's

1434
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,320
only theoretical for now because the

1435
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,000
plant writing protection office hasn't

1436
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:21,269
yet figured out how to handle the

1437
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,170
deposits of a sexually propagated plants

1438
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:27,210
seeds are one thing getting whole plants

1439
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:28,470
or some kind of tissue culture or

1440
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:31,079
something that's another thing it's a

1441
01:00:28,469 --> 01:00:34,500
whole big administrative challenge but

1442
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:36,719
the main differences are between PvP and

1443
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:40,739
a utility patent on a plant that would

1444
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:45,299
claim a seed is plant Brady protection

1445
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:47,969
as it currently exists with in usable

1446
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:51,019
ways you can use it for him you have to

1447
01:00:47,969 --> 01:00:53,730
make it a positive about 3,000 seeds I

1448
01:00:51,019 --> 01:00:56,969
think it's exactly 3,000 seeds to be

1449
01:00:53,730 --> 01:01:00,030
precise you have to pay quite a few fees

1450
01:00:56,969 --> 01:01:03,679
but the examination process is quite

1451
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:06,450
different from the US patent and then

1452
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:08,489
I'd say the biggest differences are that

1453
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:10,619
the that plant variety protection the

1454
01:01:08,489 --> 01:01:13,829
whole you pod system has two exemptions

1455
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:15,869
that don't apply to utility patent one

1456
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:18,029
is called the breeders exemption which

1457
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:19,859
means that it is not an infringement of

1458
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:22,950
a plant variety protection certificate

1459
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:25,289
to use a protected variety in breeding

1460
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:27,210
other varieties there's also called

1461
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:29,340
breeders rights breeders rights yeah

1462
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:30,869
well sometimes when they talk about

1463
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:32,760
breeders rights they talk about the

1464
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:34,710
rights that accrue to the owner of that

1465
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,340
of that registration no this is

1466
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:40,019
specifically on the PvP right yes but

1467
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,329
then the other exemption is the farmers

1468
01:01:40,019 --> 01:01:46,349
exemption which means that a farmer who

1469
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:50,549
buys registered seed can save enough

1470
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:52,199
seed to replant the same acreage season

1471
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:54,870
after season and that that's not an

1472
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:56,819
infringement the farmers not allowed

1473
01:01:54,869 --> 01:01:58,679
into that exemption to sell the seed or

1474
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,200
to make more seed than then enough to

1475
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:03,210
replant that field or that acreage but

1476
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,579
that that's an affirmative right that

1477
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:07,590
that is carved out of the plant variety

1478
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:12,150
Protection Act that is not doesn't have

1479
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:14,940
an analogy in a u.s. utility patent so

1480
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:17,070
if you want to have the maximum control

1481
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:19,639
over how you help people use the seeds

1482
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:24,990
that you sell the right way to do that

1483
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:26,369
would be with a US utility patent we can

1484
01:02:24,989 --> 01:02:29,069
talk a lot more of the laughs yeah thank

1485
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:31,829
you yeah and there's a lot more and just

1486
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:35,630
a comment because one of the organize

1487
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:38,819
that Oregon is really taking a lead in

1488
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:40,260
certified seed hemp seed right now

1489
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:42,690
they've been certifying seed in Oregon

1490
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:44,700
for over a hundred years largest

1491
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:47,639
producer of grass seed on planet earth

1492
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:49,409
so they're pretty far ahead and actually

1493
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,569
working on that state board with a

1494
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:53,609
couple other breeders but the comment I

1495
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:56,250
wanted to make another organization I

1496
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:59,519
mean this is for Janine and Trevor this

1497
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:02,010
is the like in a VA you called it a GI

1498
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,869
or an appellation the one thing that I

1499
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:05,910
don't hear talked about sometimes I

1500
01:03:03,869 --> 01:03:08,849
think is it a weakness in that for

1501
01:03:05,909 --> 01:03:11,399
high-end cannabis is number one it's an

1502
01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:13,529
annual plant so it's not the same as a

1503
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:17,220
vine that's going to get the terroir

1504
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:19,800
number two we had a guy a geologist from

1505
01:03:17,219 --> 01:03:22,349
OSU which is our premier AG school in

1506
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:24,930
Oregon it's like the UC Davis of Oregon

1507
01:03:22,349 --> 01:03:27,569
and he came down and wanted to

1508
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:29,819
investigate bringing forward exactly

1509
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:32,820
what you guys are talking about the GI

1510
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:35,190
the Appalachians so he gave clones to a

1511
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:37,140
lot of people through our Sun grown

1512
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:39,269
growers guild and the one thing that

1513
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:42,449
people haven't thought about is most

1514
01:03:39,269 --> 01:03:45,269
high end cannabis is not grown first

1515
01:03:42,449 --> 01:03:48,210
annual plant number too often not grown

1516
01:03:45,269 --> 01:03:50,460
in native soil grown in big bags of

1517
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:53,280
imported soil so you're not going to get

1518
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:55,679
the terroir of the flavor so I think

1519
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,510
it's a good play for us as an industry I

1520
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:59,339
just want to make that point it doesn't

1521
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,720
necessarily require an answer from you

1522
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:03,720
at this time I don't want to take any

1523
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:06,419
more time but I think it's a longer play

1524
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:08,279
the Appalachian versus protecting our

1525
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,619
genetics through other means it could be

1526
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:12,510
more effective now and that's something

1527
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:15,710
we have to think about it's not grown in

1528
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,710
native soil by and large

1529
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,800
those are excellent points and I would

1530
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:24,719
like to respond briefly there are

1531
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:28,170
geographic indication protections for

1532
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:31,349
annuals and also products in general not

1533
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:32,789
just crops and to your second point

1534
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:36,089
which is an excellent one with respect

1535
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:37,619
to terroir and native soil one of the

1536
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:40,950
things our organization is looking at

1537
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:44,299
from a research perspective is the

1538
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:47,339
microbiome because we feel like that is

1539
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:50,070
an array that creates a bridge between

1540
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,769
the the native soil and essentially the

1541
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:56,660
native microbiome of the region that can

1542
01:04:52,769 --> 01:04:59,190
populate and integrate with soil mediums

1543
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:01,619
to such an extent that there is that

1544
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:04,139
localized influence particularly with

1545
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:06,119
respect to the exudate relationship and

1546
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:07,559
then the metabolome a expression of the

1547
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:10,829
plant and so that's something we're

1548
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:12,809
really specifically looking at with

1549
01:05:10,829 --> 01:05:15,029
respect to how this might be relevant

1550
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:19,639
for cannabis as an annual that is

1551
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:22,980
frequently cultivated in aggregate soil

1552
01:05:19,639 --> 01:05:25,319
so I'd love to speak more with you after

1553
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,969
the panel all right I think we're gonna

1554
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,530
wrap this up so folks and get some lunch

1555
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:29,789
before disappears but I want to thank

1556
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:32,330
all the panelists here thank you very

1557
01:05:29,789 --> 01:05:32,329
much it's great
