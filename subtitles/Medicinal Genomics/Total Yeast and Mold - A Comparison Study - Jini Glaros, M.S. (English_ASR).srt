00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,940
Hello everybody welcome so today we're

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,859
going to talk about total yeast and mold

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,660
if you are in the lab industry you're

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:15,000
probably very familiar with total yeast

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,100
in mold if you're not some of this may

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,079
be very new to you so I am going to do a

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,600
brief overview at the beginning

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,519
so what is total yeast in mold so when

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,980
we talk about total yeast and mold

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,259
testing we're talking about looking at

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,599
quantitatively the number of colony

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,719
forming units that are present in one

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,700
gram of sample or cfu per gram that's

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,000
how we quantify it when we report out a

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,120
result we say there's 3 000 cfu per gram

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,878
or 10 000 cfu per gram or whatever that

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,759
number may be and total yeast in mold

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,640
can include so many different species it

19
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,159
includes everything every total mold or

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,359
Yeast you can think of it includes so

21
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,919
aspergillus penicillin candida

22
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,619
sportabolis

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,500
fusarium and many more and that's one of

24
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,959
the complexities with doing total yeast

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,900
and mold testing when you're looking for

26
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,938
so many different things how do you know

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,560
if you're seeing them all and how do you

28
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,599
know if everything you're seeing is

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,420
dangerous or if everything you're seeing

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,059
is good what is the problem that arises

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,099
with total yeast in mold testing

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,140
so total yeast in mold testing in a

33
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,359
laboratory there's three primary ways

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,219
that Laboratories are providing total

35
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,560
yeast in mold testing the first being

36
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,079
culture-based plating methods and that's

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,780
going to be using an agar or a petri

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,578
film or membrane filter and growing

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,540
colonies they're going to take a sample

40
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:44,879
dilute it with a media add you know the

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,680
sample to the plate put that in the

42
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,298
incubator and then wait for it to grow

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,579
and see what happens and then they're

44
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,799
going to count those colonies the next

45
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,658
way is going to be qpcr methods or

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,060
quantitative polymerase Chain Reaction

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,680
methods and what that's going to do is

48
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,359
you're going to take the sample and

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,220
you're going to completely isolate the

50
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,799
DNA you're going to isolate both the

51
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,658
Cannabis DNA and the microbe DNA after

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,060
that you're going to use primers and

53
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,739
other mix that with that the primers

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,239
that'll look for both the Cannabis DNA

55
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,800
and the microbe DNA and then you're

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,480
going to put that on the PCR and it's

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,400
going to heat and cool and heat and cool

58
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,318
and it's going to replicate and then if

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,000
those microbes are present you'll see

60
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,859
this fluorescence and you'll be able to

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,080
detect and quantitate the amount of

62
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,480
yeast in mold present and finally is

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,480
going to be most probable number methods

64
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,399
and these are culture-based methods but

65
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,318
the principle behind them is slightly

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,539
different so you're not physically

67
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,219
growing colonies and this you're

68
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,378
actually looking at specific

69
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:43,680
characteristics so whether that be

70
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:46,259
turbidity changes or acid production and

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,420
you're using that to predict the amount

72
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,539
of cells that would grow so you're not

73
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:54,419
actually culturing it but it is in a

74
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,639
sense a culture-based method

75
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,318
so with this you run all of these

76
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,359
different experiments and you get tons

77
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,179
of different results which is the reason

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,980
for this comparison study and so first

79
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,019
off what we wanted to do was we wanted

80
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,060
to analyze cannabis samples using

81
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,400
different types of plates

82
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,039
um whether that be agar Petri film and

83
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,158
membrane filters plating is a really big

84
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,840
controversy right Labs you go to lab a

85
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:20,459
and you get a plating result of this you

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,519
go to lab B and you get a plating result

87
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,199
drastically different so why what is

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,300
going on there and so we wanted to be

89
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,759
able to compare these methods and assess

90
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,219
the reproducibility of the methods both

91
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,620
individually and then also against one

92
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,539
another and through this we were going

93
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,000
to also be able to determine how the

94
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,699
non-homogeneous nature of cannabis

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,680
impacts total yeast in mold testing we

96
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,199
all know cannabis is not homogeneous so

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,719
what happens if I take a one gram scoop

98
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,459
here and a one gram scoop here do I get

99
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,919
completely different results which

100
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,959
result is right did I get way more yeast

101
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,000
in mold in this scoop unless you Eastern

102
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,459
mold in this scoop so that raises

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,739
questions and then also to establish

104
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,420
true incubation times for each plating

105
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,400
method a lot of the different

106
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,518
manufacturers that produce these plates

107
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,120
make recommendations incubate for 48 to

108
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,980
72 hours well guess what if you're a

109
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,959
cannabis lab and you've been told by a

110
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,779
manufacturer you could incubate for a

111
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,399
minimum of 48 Hours chances are cannabis

112
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,439
labs are just going to proceed with that

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,019
because turnaround time is important

114
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,779
they need to get those results out even

115
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,819
though that method may need to go longer

116
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,138
and so we wanted to establish that as

117
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,418
well

118
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,280
so sample prep and design what we did

119
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:36,719
here was we took three unique samples

120
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,879
and these three unique samples were

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,740
weighed up five times and then we

122
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,600
pleated those samples at three different

123
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,960
dilutions and we used seven different

124
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,320
types of plates so four agars two Petri

125
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,418
films and a membrane filter and then we

126
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,478
also took a single aliquot that you see

127
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:56,519
here and we weighed it five times or we

128
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,379
had it weighed once and then we prepped

129
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,899
it five times and the goal of that was

130
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,639
to show the reproducibility from in one

131
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,560
aliquot so if you have one aliquot

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
theoretically it should have the same

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,759
amount of yeast and mold throughout so

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,019
we should get the same result for every

135
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,020
single one of those samples

136
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,519
so true incubation times let's talk

137
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,959
about that first so as I mentioned uh

138
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,500
manufacturers will make a recommendation

139
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:25,079
you know 48 to 72 hours 72 to 96 hours

140
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,000
but that's all they give you and so it's

141
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,639
the laboratory's responsibility to

142
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,740
validate that however Laboratories

143
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,360
aren't always the best at that or don't

144
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,400
really know how to go about doing that

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,139
and so that's what we did here and these

146
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,659
are the true incubation times we

147
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,400
established for total yeast and mold for

148
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,259
each of these and the true incubation

149
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,439
time was established as the point in

150
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,180
time when no new colonies formed and

151
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,459
instead the colonies only started to

152
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,019
grow they just got bigger so you'll see

153
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:54,779
on the next slide this drastic

154
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,219
difference between that 48 and 72 hour

155
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:58,319
and that's where we're going to focus is

156
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,080
that Petri film rapid yeast and mold

157
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,360
this true incubation time is 72 hours

158
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,639
even though the manufacturer

159
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,520
recommendations is anywhere from 48 to

160
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,960
72.

161
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:13,019
and that's what you can see here so you

162
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,519
can see here this top set of plates is

163
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:16,740
going to be the rapid yeast in mold

164
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,599
after 48 hours so with these samples we

165
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,740
put them in after 24 hours we pulled

166
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,439
them out of the incubator took pictures

167
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,120
put them back in for another 24 pulled

168
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,699
them out took pictures we did that all

169
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,519
the way up to 120 hours and you can see

170
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:32,340
there is a drastic difference between

171
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,978
the 48 hour and the 72 hour plate

172
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,599
results and based on this and then

173
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,159
reading those plates and attempting to

174
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,500
count those plates I mean counting the

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,539
48 hour plates is not easy and even when

176
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,819
you do count them you're drastically

177
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:47,038
under quantifying what that true amount

178
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:51,300
is we're looking at an average cfu per

179
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:56,159
gram at 48 Hours of only 44 000 whereas

180
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,439
by 72 hours we had 165 000 and I did

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,020
want to note here that you know past the

182
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,459
72 hours that average stayed about the

183
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:05,399
same we really didn't see an increase

184
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:08,538
which is why we established that as that

185
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,538
true incubation time

186
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,038
next is going to be the lack of

187
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,639
reproducibility we saw between plates so

188
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,620
here is going to be a drbc and a Sab Dex

189
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,660
plate and this is the same exact sample

190
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,918
prep so it's out of the same tube we

191
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,319
prepped it and plated it on the two

192
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:28,799
different plates and you can see for the

193
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:31,620
drbc we got an average of like 127 000

194
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,180
versus an average of 86 000 with stab

195
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,340
decks now if you're in the world of

196
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,840
micro you may say wait that's not that

197
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,538
different those are kind of duplicate

198
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,399
numbers but in the world of Florida

199
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,800
where our regulations are a hundred

200
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,779
thousand cfu per gram this is the

201
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,840
difference between a product passing and

202
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:51,239
a product failing so if a laboratory was

203
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,879
using Sab decks they would pass this

204
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,680
sample but if a laboratory is using drbc

205
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,879
they would fail the sample

206
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,699
additionally is going to be suppressions

207
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,439
at low dilution so this is the sabdex

208
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,900
plates again and what I want to point

209
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,759
out here is that 200x dilution and so

210
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,459
you can see that 200x dilution that

211
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,038
average is only about 25

212
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,839
000 across those and that's much lower

213
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:19,019
than the average we're seeing for that

214
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,299
1000x and that 10 000x and ultimately I

215
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,939
think it's due to over saturation

216
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,120
there's so many microbes present that no

217
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:30,000
more can grow however if you're using

218
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,099
this 200x it is going to drive your

219
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,479
overall average down so it's going to

220
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,300
take the average you can see if you

221
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:40,440
ignore it your average goes from you

222
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:45,659
know 61 to 81 000 it goes from 165 000

223
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:49,680
to 235 000 and from 86 000 to 115 000.

224
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:51,240
so the dilutions you use are crucial if

225
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,579
you are plating you need to be making

226
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,959
sure you're using dilutions that make

227
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,480
sense for your sample and for your

228
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,179
sample type

229
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,278
then we had the lack of homogeneity and

230
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,958
reproducibility so that sample that I

231
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,580
told you we took the one aliquot and we

232
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,799
prepped it five times out of the same

233
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,839
exact tube these are the results we got

234
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,399
so a hundred and ten thousand fifty

235
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
thousand two hundred and ten thousand

236
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,259
ninety thousand and eighty thousand so

237
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,838
all over the board you know this is

238
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,879
again the difference between for States

239
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,040
who have a ten thousand cfu per gram

240
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,659
limit this is all failing it's not a

241
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,819
problem but for States like Florida

242
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:29,639
where we have a hundred thousand cfu

243
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,680
gram per limit what do we do here what

244
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,000
is the correct answer is this product

245
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,679
failing or is this product passing

246
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,360
so conclusions for this portion of the

247
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,458
experiment are that you know the lack of

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,740
homogeneity seen in cannabis flower can

249
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,359
make it difficult to determine

250
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,639
quantitative total yeast and mold

251
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
results you may take a scoop here and

252
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,480
get one result the scoop there and get

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,220
one result it may not be due to the

254
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,379
method itself it may be due to the

255
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,839
sample and so how do we create a more

256
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,059
homogeneous sample in that sense also

257
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,680
the use of different agars or media can

258
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,859
lead to variations in the number of

259
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,379
organisms that can successfully grow so

260
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,600
certain plates have certain antibiotics

261
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:12,480
which allow certain organisms to grow

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,360
but other organisms can't grow and so

263
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,339
depending on what a lab is using they

264
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,500
may be able to skew those results and

265
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,240
some of them may not even be realizing

266
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,000
they're doing that they may just be

267
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,220
using what they've been told is you know

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,980
the gold standard to use for plating and

269
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,860
they do that and then now they could be

270
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,120
under quantifying those results also the

271
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,860
dilutions used during the plating

272
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,419
process can impact those spinal

273
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,459
calculations you need to make sure

274
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:41,039
you're working in the proper range if

275
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:44,099
you're doing a 100x and your sample has

276
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,899
a hundred thousand cfu per gram you're

277
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,639
not going to be able to grow all of

278
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,740
those colonies on a plate and you're

279
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,838
going to skew those results low once you

280
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,360
take that average and then the

281
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,040
incubation time for each plate type must

282
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,019
be determined prior to processing

283
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,819
samples all Laboratories really need to

284
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,919
go about this process they need to take

285
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,959
whatever plate type they're using and

286
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,120
you need to let it grow see what happens

287
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,659
establish that true incubation time

288
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,519
truly validate when those samples are

289
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,319
ready to come out of the incubator

290
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,000
and then also the use of internal

291
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,339
controls is something that I think we

292
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,620
should consider I don't know how to go

293
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,959
about doing this but I figured what

294
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,700
better of a conference to kind of say

295
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,219
you know this would be a great thing to

296
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,019
have think about qpcr we use an internal

297
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,060
control to make sure our extraction work

298
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,278
to make sure we did it properly the

299
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,619
chemistry side we use internal standards

300
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,600
to make sure things worked properly so

301
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,860
is there a way to implement something

302
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,060
like that into the plating process

303
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,399
with that we're going to switch to

304
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:48,059
talking about remediation of failing

305
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,100
flower products so with cannabis uh if

306
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,479
it fails for total yeast in mold there

307
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,879
or aspergillus there's a common

308
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,680
technique that is to remediate and

309
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,139
whether you're remediating that through

310
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,939
lots of different options but two of the

311
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,220
main options are going to be ozone which

312
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,980
is going to be known as it's a willow is

313
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,480
what the most common brand is called or

314
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,579
the rad source which is going to use

315
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,560
x-rays to remediate so it's going to

316
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,259
radiate the product basically use the

317
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,479
x-rays kill the yeast in mold

318
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:18,120
theoretically and then that will result

319
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,759
in the product being safe we see people

320
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,578
doing this and as a laboratory who runs

321
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:25,620
qpcr primarily people remediate their

322
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,479
product and it still fails and they're

323
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,060
not happy they said I killed all of the

324
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,039
yeast in mold and I said well I still

325
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:35,338
see the yeast in mold and they said

326
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:37,559
we'll switch to plating so we said we'll

327
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:41,040
look into it and that is where this

328
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,138
study came about so we in this we wanted

329
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,559
to analyze cannabis samples pre and post

330
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:48,899
radiation using qpcr both qpcr regular

331
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,778
and qpcr with grim reefer and Grim

332
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,940
reefer will remove that dead DNA and get

333
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:56,879
rid of whatever they may have killed and

334
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,860
then agar plates and Petri film we then

335
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,778
wanted to add an enrichment step to that

336
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,720
plating process of the radiated product

337
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:06,360
to measure cell viability so one of the

338
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,579
thoughts here is sublethal cell injury

339
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,919
the cells aren't actually being killed

340
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:12,599
they're just being injured and so if we

341
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,759
give them an environment that makes them

342
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,379
happy maybe they'll grow for you and

343
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,778
then you can actually properly

344
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,338
quantitate so we wanted to add this

345
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:22,259
enrichment step to kind of see what

346
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,360
happened there and then also we wanted

347
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,759
to look at the pre and post samples for

348
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,440
cannabinoids and terpenes to see what

349
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,439
that was also doing to the product

350
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,500
so for this experimental design what we

351
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,720
did was we took all of these lovely

352
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,000
different samples so we had pre-rad post

353
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,800
rad two weeks post rad four weeks post

354
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,720
rad six weeks post-drad and eight weeks

355
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,219
post-rad and I want to mention that the

356
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,839
pre and post router the same exact

357
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,660
sample the client literally took a

358
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,339
sample grabbed a handful of it out

359
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,980
before radiating it put it in the

360
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:54,420
radiate then grab more of it and gave it

361
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,680
to us but the two weeks four weeks six

362
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:57,958
weeks and eight weeks are different

363
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,719
samples they're just those time points

364
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,359
Outpost radiation the reason for doing

365
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,980
that is to see if you know after eight

366
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,180
weeks have those cells repaired

367
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,620
themselves and are now we're going to

368
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,479
have tons of yeast in mold growth

369
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,639
whenever we go to Plate this

370
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,379
so we took all of those samples we

371
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,000
prepped them in triplicate then we

372
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:18,179
plated them at three dilutions using

373
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,639
drbc and 3M rapid Easton mold and then

374
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:23,159
we also analyzed those samples via qpcr

375
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,799
and qpcr with grim reefer

376
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,139
and this is the average cfus that we saw

377
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,000
across the board so anything in red is

378
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,379
going to be those failing cfus in the

379
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,720
State of Florida so a hundred thousand

380
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:35,338
over a hundred thousand cfu per gram and

381
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,980
you can see that that pre-rad sample

382
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,600
across the board it failed even with you

383
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,399
know the use of grim reefer brought the

384
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,620
number down some but it still failed

385
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,360
plating you know three hundred thousand

386
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,740
two hundred fifty thousand three hundred

387
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,959
and thirty thousand and a hundred and

388
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,720
forty two thousand so it's very evident

389
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,819
that flower was extremely contaminated

390
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,500
not good definitely don't want that

391
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,420
flower on the market

392
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,500
um the post rad however you can see when

393
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:04,198
we ran qpcr on it we got 435 thousand

394
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,679
but then when we plated it we only saw

395
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:09,599
1600 and 1400 and this is without that

396
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,219
enrichment step so no enrichment step

397
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,440
these are the numbers that we were

398
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,800
seeing so drastically lower numbers

399
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,420
across the board so the theory of the

400
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,458
reason why you get higher results with

401
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:24,479
qpcr is because you're not destroying

402
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:27,899
the DNA but it's dead seem to make sense

403
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,659
but we still weren't convinced we're not

404
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,120
100 convinced that this product is safe

405
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:35,100
for human consumption and so that's when

406
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,899
we added this enrichment step and so

407
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,220
what we did here was and you can see

408
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,139
these little

409
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,639
circles that I've circled these are

410
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,959
little dots that are growing we don't

411
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,639
know what they are we don't know if

412
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,859
they're trichome interactions we don't

413
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,959
know if they're just particulate or are

414
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,240
they colonies that are attempting to

415
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,578
form but something has happened during

416
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,620
this radiation process and now these

417
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,719
colonies can't grow I don't know what it

418
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,698
is so I want to figure out what it is so

419
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,440
we took those samples put them in the

420
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:03,419
incubator for three hours and then we

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,820
plated them again and that allowed us to

422
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,979
enrich them give them that time to get

423
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,920
excited and get happy and if they were

424
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,980
alive hopefully to grow for us

425
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:16,799
and so here is the cfu averages after

426
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,539
enrichment so with no enrichment for

427
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,259
that pre-rad sample you saw you know

428
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:24,299
about 300 000 or so after enrichment you

429
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,278
saw way way higher numbers which tells

430
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:28,500
me that my enrichment process worked

431
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:31,078
that's why I wanted to enrich that

432
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,778
pre-rad sample is to show that if you

433
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:36,599
enrich it it's going to grow you know if

434
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:39,059
it's there if it's happy if it's in the

435
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,800
good juice it's gonna work and we were

436
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,258
able to show that with that but then

437
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,719
post rad you can see we did see a slight

438
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,759
increase in some of these samples but

439
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,500
nothing drastic nothing that would lead

440
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,199
us to believe that the product was

441
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,078
failing as far as if we're going to

442
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:58,078
Plate it however that doesn't mean that

443
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:00,838
these cells are not viable but not

444
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,638
culturable so are they still viable are

445
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,679
they still dangerous but can we just not

446
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,900
culture them

447
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,059
so looking at cannabinoids and terpenes

448
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,480
then is going to be our pre-rad and our

449
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:14,399
post rad flower here so to the naked eye

450
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,380
these flower samples may look the same

451
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,419
also these pictures may not be the best

452
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,579
however if you look at these in person

453
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:22,860
and you are looking at cannabis flour

454
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,779
all day every day like our team is you

455
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,000
get samples in that are radiated and we

456
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:28,740
can normally tell we're like this went

457
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,140
through radsource or this went through

458
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,880
Willow because they look almost bleached

459
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,340
they aren't as vibrant they aren't as

460
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,720
green and so what does that mean what is

461
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:39,298
that doing to the flower I don't know

462
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,160
but for a consumer they may never notice

463
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,319
they may never see the difference in

464
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,179
this and they may never be told that

465
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,980
their product went through rad Source or

466
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,960
went through ozone treatment

467
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,700
so we ran the potency in the terpenes

468
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,819
and you can see that the pre-rad sample

469
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,460
the average potency was 18.3 and then

470
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:59,279
post rad was 15.4 and then for the total

471
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,679
terpenes we saw 2.37 and then that

472
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,960
dropped to 1.98 and so when you

473
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,940
calculate the rpds between those results

474
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:12,179
they're about 17 for both so we saw a 17

475
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,980
RPD decrease after radiation does this

476
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,780
mean this happens to every single sample

477
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,900
that goes through the rad Source I'm not

478
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:21,319
sure but this is what we saw from our

479
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,059
preliminary investigation

480
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:27,599
so conclusions with this is going to be

481
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:30,058
that qpcr and Grim Reef for qpcr yield

482
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,980
higher amounts of total yeast in mold in

483
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,139
radiated cannabis products than plating

484
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,599
so we're definitely getting a higher

485
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,900
concentration what concentration is

486
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:41,819
right I'm still not convinced by total

487
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,460
yeast in mold is a pain it drives me

488
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:47,819
crazy but we're here to figure it out

489
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,919
right the addition of enrichment step

490
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,379
can lead to overgrowth in the

491
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,140
pre-radiated samples so you definitely

492
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,200
don't want to enrich your pre-radiated

493
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,200
samples however the post-radiated flower

494
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,298
did not yield a drastic increase but it

495
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,279
just makes me feel more comfortable if

496
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:08,099
there is something alive there if I give

497
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,720
it a chance maybe it'll grow so it makes

498
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:11,279
me as a laboratory feel a little bit

499
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,919
more confident in releasing plating

500
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,139
results and then any viable cells that

501
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,940
may be present in radiated flour do not

502
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,500
come culturable for at least eight weeks

503
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,019
after treatment so that's what we saw

504
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,880
there is you know we treated they were

505
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:26,220
treated eight weeks later we still saw

506
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,340
no growth does that mean they're not

507
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,860
viable again I don't have the answer to

508
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,298
that but I can say that I was not able

509
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:35,399
to culture them

510
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:37,440
the cannabinoid and terpene content can

511
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,419
decrease after a product is undergone

512
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,860
radiation whether or not this is an

513
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,100
outlier this is something that happens

514
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:46,619
every time this could also change based

515
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:49,439
on the amount of time it's in the rad

516
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,759
Source the amount of rad source that it

517
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,640
experiences

518
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,038
Etc so there's a lot of variables here

519
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,419
that in further studies we're going to

520
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,339
need to better control we're going to

521
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,799
need to have more information from our

522
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:03,779
client of exactly how much how long

523
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,058
they're being exposed to the X-ray what

524
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:08,099
rate of X-ray they're being exposed to

525
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:09,720
so we can kind of better pinpoint is

526
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,399
there a point where you're destroying

527
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,798
the yeast in mold but you're not hurting

528
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,480
the flower and then more research is

529
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,700
needed to determine whether or not this

530
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,740
remediation process is truly removing

531
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,200
all of the total yeast in mold or if

532
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,259
it's simply fooling the test so that's

533
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,200
the big takeaway here is is remediation

534
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:30,119
able to actually fix our product or is

535
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,500
remediation just figuring out a way to

536
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,500
trick the test

537
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,620
thanks for your presentation very

538
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,359
informative indeed as far as I know one

539
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,000
of the concerns health concerns of this

540
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,979
micro microbial contamination is related

541
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,500
to the mycotic scenes produced by some

542
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,259
of those species particularly fusarium

543
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,900
aspergillus I understand that

544
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:58,859
remediation might kill those

545
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,919
microorganisms but what happens to those

546
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:04,079
mycotoxins are are they also eliminated

547
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,480
so mycotoxins are interesting because

548
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,159
they're not a living species anymore

549
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,620
like the microbes so they're secondary

550
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,500
metabolites so with the mycotoxins when

551
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:14,759
you have a microbial and it starts to

552
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,759
break down you form the secondary

553
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:19,798
metabolite from our experience we can we

554
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,019
have seen that even when you extract

555
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,298
something if it previously had that

556
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:27,599
contaminant and it allowed it to form

557
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:29,279
we've still seen mycotoxins present so I

558
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,399
would say that it doesn't get rid of it

559
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,500
so you're still you're still having a

560
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,960
whole nother battle which is why that

561
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,000
mycotoxin testing is so important even

562
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,620
if you're able to eliminate the

563
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,400
microorganism mycotoxin is still is

564
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:43,500
remaining

565
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,019
it yes thank you

566
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,339
I'm sure that they're self-picking these

567
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:49,200
samples right

568
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:52,038
the the companies are self-picking the

569
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,600
sample right there's no state

570
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:56,759
for final product we do all of the

571
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,918
sampling ourselves so once the product

572
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,140
has been radiated if it's being sent for

573
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,820
final compliance testing it is already

574
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,159
in its package and we go out and

575
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:07,019
randomly select but for this experiment

576
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,360
they sent the sample but yes Florida

577
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:10,918
does Florida is very strict about their

578
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,658
sampling procedures it is there a

579
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,159
minimum or maximum to the lot size that

580
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:16,559
you get to pick from

581
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,299
is it mandated on the volume you know is

582
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,639
it 10 pounds did you actually pick that

583
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:23,099
sample from or is it you know 20. so

584
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,200
it's based on the batch size so we have

585
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:28,139
to take point three five percent of the

586
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,419
batch plus 10 grams for total yeast in

587
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,000
mold so you know you're going to take a

588
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,100
minimum or a minimum of 15 grams plus 10

589
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,619
grams so we're always as a lab bringing

590
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:40,319
back a minimum of 25 grams of flour 25

591
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:43,678
grams of flour from a maximum volume of

592
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,599
that would be from a maximum of about 4

593
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,900
000 grams and then after that it would

594
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:51,000
increase wow so as your batch size

595
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,700
increases once you reach that threshold

596
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,460
of the 0.35 percent you then have to

597
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,380
start collecting More Sample that's

598
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,058
that's better so I mean there's some

599
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,840
samples where we literally bring back

600
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:04,678
like 250 grams of sample

601
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,259
thank you

602
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,460
thank you

603
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,379
hey great talk

604
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,380
um I

605
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,480
have a well I'm curious about something

606
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,780
um you know when I buy my weed I don't

607
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,839
bring it home and soak it in a broth so

608
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:23,460
um maybe I do I need to care about these

609
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,678
like residual microbes I think I would

610
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,720
care more about the mycotoxins so with

611
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,460
the microbes the thing is is that's just

612
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,460
allowing us to culture them and to grow

613
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,500
them but standardly they're still there

614
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,298
that's just allowing us to quantify them

615
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,159
by adding them to that broth but yeah

616
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:39,720
but if they're that hard to culture then

617
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,039
they're probably I mean it seems like

618
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,079
they're probably less competent to

619
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,298
infect me too right

620
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,798
it's hard to say it depends on what it

621
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,418
is I mean if you have some powdery

622
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,940
mildew I don't think you want to be

623
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:53,100
inhaling the powdery mildew no no I

624
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:58,500
don't want the toxins or the residue

625
00:23:53,099 --> 00:24:00,480
from it right but um uh when you um

626
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,460
when you measure these irradiated

627
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,200
samples like

628
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,538
I would love to see the error bars and

629
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,880
stuff because I like like we do this

630
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:10,440
with so much of our food radiation is

631
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,020
brilliant I've seen lots of data from

632
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,820
radsource and other radiation companies

633
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:18,538
I think a lot of people suck at using

634
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:20,279
the machines but um I think rad source

635
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:21,960
and radiation is used differently in

636
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:24,240
other Industries though it's not

637
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,298
necessarily it's used for shelf life

638
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,620
purposes rather than to kill

639
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:33,298
bad things yeah yeah yeah well and again

640
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,699
right just the fact that the critters

641
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:39,119
were growing in the weed that's the bad

642
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,038
part right like like and what they were

643
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,199
doing they've been crapping in my weed

644
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,900
right so that's why I don't want it but

645
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,960
yeah I I would find it hard to believe

646
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,580
that used properly this rad source is

647
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,558
going to do a significant amount I mean

648
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:54,359
I don't do much chemistry with x-rays

649
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,399
that's why that's what we're using for

650
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,259
and I think that's why more research you

651
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,659
know ultimately needs to be done before

652
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:02,940
we just put a ton of rad Source product

653
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:05,340
on the market is what is it doing to the

654
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,558
product make sure it's actually you know

655
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:09,240
solving the problem rather than just

656
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,639
tricking the test because there are

657
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,740
dangerous molds that could be present a

658
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,200
spurgeless could be present and rad

659
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,538
Source could allow that Colony not to

660
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,000
grow but the aspergillus then broke down

661
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:23,460
into mycotoxins that now you're inhaling

662
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,038
mycotoxins so there's so many different

663
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,900
pieces to the puzzle that I think that

664
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:29,900
the whole picture needs to be addressed
