1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:09,379
I'm also going to thank the organizers

2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:11,690
which sounds very weird considering my

3
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:12,949
relationship here but it's true in that

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:15,468
anyone who knows me knows I'm not this

5
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:18,289
organized so many hats off to Doug

6
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:19,399
Kennedy in the cordon team here we are

7
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,429
going to be speaking a little bit about

8
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:23,629
decentralization and what the cannabis

9
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:25,489
industry is going through because when

10
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,868
you look at this from historical context

11
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:28,909
and you look at other industries when

12
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:30,829
this happens use do see real Renaissance

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,058
a curb we're not all the way there yet

14
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,729
as you've seen from many of the speakers

15
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:36,679
today there still is centralized control

16
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:39,048
over the cannabis industry and it leads

17
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,210
to one-size-fits-all thinking which can

18
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:43,488
be detrimental to watch the marketplace

19
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,140
but we're half way there were partially

20
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:46,820
decentralized with the laboratory of

21
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,859
democracy here where many different

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,899
states and countries are experimenting

23
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:53,420
and this experimentation is incredibly

24
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:54,738
healthy we hopefully will eventually get

25
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,298
to complete permissionless innovation

26
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:58,518
which will happen if it's a fully

27
00:00:56,298 --> 00:00:59,899
decentralized environment but I don't

28
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:01,670
think we're there I think we still need

29
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,469
some tools to accelerate this we need

30
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,058
catalysts to get us there and when you

31
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:07,158
look at other industries have gone

32
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:08,868
through this those catalysts sometimes

33
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,479
actually require some order from chaos

34
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:13,340
as my brother just brought up so let's

35
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,349
take some historical examples that are

36
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,000
perhaps overused and a little bit trite

37
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:18,408
you look there's no technology

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,959
presentation you can do without talking

39
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:22,399
about the printing press so here we are

40
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,438
Gutenberg's printing press it wasn't

41
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:25,460
really the first book that presented off

42
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:27,559
it that mattered it was the fact that

43
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:29,868
anybody could print it and we've seen

44
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,700
this also with the internet we have a

45
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:33,049
very vibrant debate now over what's fake

46
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,640
news and what's real news and I actually

47
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,899
think that's fantastic because now

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,670
people are actually looking for

49
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:40,159
references and we actually have science

50
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,439
omit the scientific method inside of the

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,640
news agencies hopefully and it gets

52
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:45,648
people to think for their own this is

53
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,968
this is very very helpful we're seeing

54
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,888
it in the financial industries with

55
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:50,449
Bitcoin this is a centralized banking

56
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:51,888
crisis that we have that's all over the

57
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,689
globe right now and now there's

58
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:55,129
cryptography and peer-to-peer networks

59
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:56,718
that can do this a different way we have

60
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:58,699
a 30 billion dollar economy that's

61
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,318
booming out of this thing and it's gonna

62
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,630
play a role in all types of informatics

63
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,569
databases in the future and of course

64
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:07,339
now we are in a world where we can

65
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:09,740
sequence genomes out of things that fit

66
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,390
in our pocket I was actually afraid to

67
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,710
tell you about this and fear that this

68
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:14,299
whole audience would clear out of here

69
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,920
and go look at it but a Vaughn has just

70
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,210
set up a DNA sequence they're out there

71
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,929
in the hallway and it's sequencing a

72
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,090
cannabis genome

73
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,650
as we speak so go have a look at that

74
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,329
when this is over but this is gonna mean

75
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,620
that you can decentralize sequencing you

76
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:26,569
no longer need million dollar

77
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,069
laboratories with licenses to sequence

78
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:29,179
we're gonna see people do it in Africa

79
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:31,009
we're gonna see people do it in

80
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,109
Afghanistan and that's gonna change

81
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,848
fundamentally how we approach science

82
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,560
because many more questions can be asked

83
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:38,419
about the code of life as opposed to

84
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,299
having somebody to manage it to you what

85
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,468
it is by some written book this is

86
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,909
what's gonna happen in the next few

87
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:45,348
years it's already happening we have

88
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:46,878
million-dollar sequencers you may have

89
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,649
seen up with the Couture's accordion

90
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,108
they're turning into these things in the

91
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,150
next few years we have PCR equipment

92
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:55,549
that's probably 20,000 dollars to get

93
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,340
your hands on and it's turning into USB

94
00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:00,980
based pcr devices you can see out on the

95
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,569
tables out there so when this happens

96
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,979
much more innovation is going to come to

97
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:05,718
the table because many more minds can

98
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:08,388
access this and many more minds means

99
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,979
much more innovation so to make this

100
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,019
innovation happen we do need a little

101
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:14,328
bit of a nomenclature system if you look

102
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,980
at the internet it runs off of tcp/ip if

103
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:17,810
you look at Bitcoin it actually has

104
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:19,218
everybody agreeing on a consensus and

105
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,049
everybody running the same code and

106
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:23,269
Gutenberg probably had a font size that

107
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,099
mattered these things help us

108
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,930
communicate when we want to decentralize

109
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:29,238
so I'm going to go through a couple

110
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,459
examples of this here we sequence things

111
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,780
of variety of different ways at ed

112
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,370
medicinal genomics and quarter gin

113
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,109
there's whole genome sequencing when you

114
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,849
sequence the whole 800 mega base genome

115
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:40,609
we put a couple thousand of those public

116
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:41,988
we have some strain seek version one

117
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:43,729
which we did many years ago we were

118
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,989
sequencing 3 million bases out of the

119
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:47,419
plant and you get about a hundred

120
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,739
thousand variants from that strain state

121
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,120
version two is what we're doing mostly

122
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,739
today there's eight hundred and fifty

123
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,539
thousand bases sequenced for that and

124
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,878
that gives us a nice ten thousand

125
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:57,198
variants or so we've put it four hundred

126
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:59,149
and twenty of those public just this

127
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,650
week many of them have been partially

128
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,060
public through canopy dia we got them a

129
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,590
little bit more organized recently and

130
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,469
I'm gonna touch on one that's a little

131
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:09,079
bit smaller than this a $450,000 or 450

132
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:10,489
thousand base pair panel that we use to

133
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,199
try and build a rosetta stone for all

134
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:13,849
the public data that's out there so we

135
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,829
can look at data in the same way and

136
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:17,298
then there are sniped genotyping tools

137
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,009
we're gonna touch on as well where you

138
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,810
can just genotype a couple snips to

139
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,030
really understand what's going on with

140
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,399
your plant so this is a phylogenetic

141
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,750
tree now that's up on canopy dia it's

142
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,549
actually an interactive one I don't

143
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,839
think I have time to bounce to it on the

144
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,240
on the website here but if you scroll

145
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,529
around in this these

146
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,879
apples will light up based on their

147
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:36,519
proximity to each other when I say

148
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,439
proximity I mean their genomic proximity

149
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,139
so there is a scale on there that's a

150
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,939
ROYGBIV scale red orange yellow blue

151
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,319
green that tries to designate if

152
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:46,120
something's within a clone distance of

153
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,860
one another a sibling distance of one

154
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,530
another or a distant cousin and so on

155
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,389
and so you can see from maps like this

156
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:54,459
you can quickly select a set that are

157
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,960
closely related and we also happen to

158
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:58,870
have hundreds of these things terpene

159
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,068
and chemo type assess so we can ask do

160
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,598
the ones that are very genetically

161
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,699
similar does it predict the chemo type

162
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:06,158
of the plant in the case of these ACDC

163
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,228
can athon declines they do we see very

164
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:10,180
consistent mersin signatures out of

165
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:12,310
these pining and busy bolo

166
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,538
we've also see this in a Terp inyline

167
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,860
class of samples that are quite

168
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:17,500
frequently found with the jack herer

169
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,210
class and the st. Jack's

170
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,829
and they come out with beta-carotene and

171
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:23,408
turpentine so the genetics are beginning

172
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:26,228
to give us a prediction tool for which

173
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:28,120
terpenes might in fact be expressed and

174
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:30,310
this can be very important if you want

175
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,680
to understand nomenclature and labeling

176
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,209
right so we didn't run around in

177
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,560
sequence about fifteen or twenty blue

178
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,620
dreams from all over the country to

179
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,680
figure out what is this thing and you'll

180
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,718
see that lots of them actually cluster

181
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,400
right up here in red but there are some

182
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,019
over here and some over there and some

183
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,359
of there and we see some people have

184
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:51,189
renamed them to snoop stream and there

185
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,319
are absolute clones of something else

186
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:57,038
and maybe they sell better we don't know

187
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,718
but that does go on and the question is

188
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,908
can you split this with something more

189
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:02,529
than sequencing 450,000 bases because

190
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:03,879
that can be expensive and we're gonna

191
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,500
we're gonna touch on that in a bit

192
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,209
the other thing that's going on in this

193
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,649
data set it's not yet public but we're

194
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:10,209
working to move it there is that we are

195
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:12,370
sequencing the microbiomes of these

196
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:14,019
we've done about 400 microbiomes of the

197
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,240
cannabis flowers occasionally on the

198
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,680
roots and about 10% of those have

199
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,019
actually been on samples that have been

200
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,490
terpene profile and the reason for this

201
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,899
is we know the microbes are playing a

202
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,889
role in terpene metabolism we know

203
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,138
they're playing a role in terpene

204
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:29,468
expression if you look at this wonderful

205
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,478
paper that went about using antibiotics

206
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,949
to fumigate the plants they see the

207
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,068
terpene expression changes if you

208
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,478
actually fumigate them with antibiotics

209
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,800
now this wasn't done in cannabis but you

210
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:40,689
can see the terpenes that are up there

211
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
imply that it'll probably happen in

212
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:45,129
cannabis these were very similar

213
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,718
terpenes little ol piney Mersin so

214
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:48,729
we're expecting a similar thing to occur

215
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:50,228
so we can't ignore the microbiome the

216
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:51,338
genetics are of course predictive but

217
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:53,949
it's the hand that you're dealt not

218
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:55,988
necessarily how you play it and so we're

219
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,429
keeping an eye on that now switching

220
00:06:55,988 --> 00:06:58,959
gears a little bit here when you have

221
00:06:57,428 --> 00:07:01,478
this much sequence density if you

222
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,879
sequence two you know 450,000 bases or

223
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,649
850,000 bases inside of a inside of a

224
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,119
cannabis plant you get it enough markers

225
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:08,829
throughout the genome to do what's known

226
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:10,449
as genome-wide Association studies and

227
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:12,128
you're just simply tracking the variants

228
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,959
to see if they correlate with a

229
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:15,789
particular trait a quantitative trait

230
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,559
loci they call it and when you do this

231
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:19,899
you start to get some signatures coming

232
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:21,550
out you need about 200 samples done done

233
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:24,069
that are profiled with your trait and

234
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,658
and you have perhaps they're altering

235
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,619
profile and not tripping profile and

236
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:28,418
when you do this we're already starting

237
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:30,519
to see some signature for snips that

238
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:31,808
might predict terpene expression now we

239
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,740
need to expand this with more strands

240
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:34,300
because we didn't have a whole lot of

241
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,668
terbutaline rich strains in this data

242
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,629
set but it's promising because this is

243
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:39,968
what we did with the human genome

244
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:42,158
project it worked very well so this

245
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:43,928
leads us to a rosetta stone panel that

246
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:45,699
we just recently caught and we have a

247
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:48,609
couple hundred samples deep into this

248
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,929
this is meant to triangulate all the

249
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,550
public data that's now public we have

250
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,168
many people contributing to cannabis

251
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,059
genomics now which is fantastic we've

252
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:56,378
got a data set from knowing Keynes lab

253
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,849
he's gonna speak about this we've got

254
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:59,379
John page here who's gonna speak about

255
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:01,118
all the data they've done we have

256
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,278
Philo's out Oregon who's doing a lot of

257
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:05,439
great work they've put 845 samples

258
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:06,550
public as well but the problem is we're

259
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,019
all sequencing different regions of the

260
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,189
genome so it's very difficult to take

261
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,778
our data and compare to theirs and

262
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,999
vice-versa and so we can't really build

263
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:14,800
a nomenclature system until we can start

264
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,969
to triangulate these things so we

265
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,199
decided to build a panel that would

266
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:19,028
sequence hundreds of snips from

267
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,889
everybody's data so that we can then

268
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:23,168
triangulate any one sample to everyone

269
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,329
else and while we're at it we figured we

270
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,889
all sequence the genes that everyone

271
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,749
cares about which are these cannabinoid

272
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:31,418
inter peen genes that that the VAM

273
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:33,219
Baykal paper described back in 2011 so

274
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:35,769
we have this panel running now and we're

275
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,019
beginning to sequence these to refine

276
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:39,938
some of these maps but I think what's

277
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:42,009
gonna distill from this is the capacity

278
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:44,379
to take all of the snips that have the

279
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:46,149
most discriminatory power in and distill

280
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:47,860
them into a barcode if you will and the

281
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:49,750
reason we want this is that these terms

282
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,889
indica and sativa anyone who's done

283
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,839
genomics will tell you they're

284
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:55,058
meaningless and people are putting these

285
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,069
on labels and giving them to patients so

286
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:58,259
we have to change this we don't mind

287
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,818
those historical terms but

288
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,459
thrown around but we should bring in

289
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:03,988
something that has a little bit more

290
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,518
digital signature to actually the

291
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:07,109
fingerprints of these strains and that

292
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,489
may also tie to the chemo type by

293
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:11,100
sequencing some of some of those genes

294
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:13,139
so what we want to do is sort these

295
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,509
snips that are quite potently

296
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,489
informative into an array that can then

297
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,869
get distilled into a barcode label and

298
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,850
when we ask that question we're

299
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:23,519
beginning to zero in and around 30 snips

300
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,009
29 snips maybe 27 there's some debate as

301
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,239
to how many exactly we need but it's

302
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:29,548
looking like it's a very small number

303
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:32,009
that we can use to distill any one of

304
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:33,389
those strains on that large map and if

305
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,428
that's the case it changes the way you

306
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:37,649
think about the technology and how

307
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:39,749
decentralize you can get so here's a

308
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,448
list of blue dream and what you're gonna

309
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:43,769
see appear on vertically are every blue

310
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,208
dream sample and the different snips

311
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,339
they have at the particular scaffold

312
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,988
locations in the genome and of course

313
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,089
you can see that all those red ones that

314
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,829
are clones have very similar snip

315
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,179
patterns and some of the ones that are

316
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:56,488
sitting off in the other areas of the

317
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:58,228
chart like at 8 o'clock and 6:15 and

318
00:09:56,489 --> 00:10:00,479
10:30 they're the ones that are way out

319
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:02,609
here so we can readily discern between

320
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:05,999
clones siblings and things that are just

321
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:07,288
mislabeled with just 29 snips and we

322
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:09,149
think that's gonna hold true throughout

323
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:11,399
the rest of the tree which brings us to

324
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:13,528
the second part of this talk which is

325
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,659
how do we make this go to the grow

326
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:17,999
because there are state lines we have to

327
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:19,918
honor we can't move material we can move

328
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:22,139
DNA around we can't move leaf matter

329
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:23,220
around and we want to get the the grows

330
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,818
to be actually be able to do this on

331
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,769
site so there's a lot of people that

332
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:30,688
helped on this the reason I have to have

333
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,129
this Henry Ford thing up here is that

334
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:33,629
this would not have happened without the

335
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,220
help from New England Biolabs it would

336
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:36,538
not have helped and help or happen

337
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,859
without the help from Ike and chemical

338
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:40,048
in Japan it would not have happened

339
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:41,369
without amplia sand mini PCR there's one

340
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:43,139
of those devices out there I recommend

341
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:44,459
people see and we did play around with

342
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,278
some nano pores in the process as well

343
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:50,188
and we have one of those running on the

344
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,499
desk out there so what do we do well

345
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:56,188
let's use these six hundred and fifty

346
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:57,449
dollar USB drives that can do PCR these

347
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,998
are now available they're no longer

348
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:01,288
twenty thousand dollars they do not have

349
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,850
a detector head on them which is one

350
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:04,438
reason why they're very cheap they're

351
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,538
light enough you can get them up to the

352
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:07,918
space station they're sending one up in

353
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:09,239
the next mission I've heard it may

354
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,859
already be there

355
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:11,670
and you can't get them to the TSA I've

356
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:13,200
done that

357
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:15,750
they didn't have any issues with it I

358
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,450
didn't have to pour it out so it does

359
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,090
it's very portable very light but with

360
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,650
this it does eight wells of PCR you can

361
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,780
bet you can gang up two of them under

362
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,819
one laptop the asset costs are still a

363
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,079
little bit unknown it's around 750 it

364
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,420
should be cheaper than anything you put

365
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,800
the mail and the ambiguity here is that

366
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,939
we don't know the kit sizes people want

367
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,409
yeah we're collecting a lot of feedback

368
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,420
on that it could they could be big they

369
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:40,289
could be small and you'll see why that

370
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:41,729
matters momentarily and the other detail

371
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:43,469
here is that it works off a hole punch

372
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,360
one hole punch from a leaf and you can

373
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,430
get genomic information off of it with a

374
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,889
very quick prep that we have that can be

375
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:51,899
showcased outside and you get answers in

376
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,279
ninety minutes so this is much faster

377
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,289
than shipping in the mail and waiting a

378
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,970
day or two and the more important thing

379
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:58,649
that our lawyers really addressed on

380
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,899
this is that the reason we did this and

381
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,220
the impetus we did this was that we had

382
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,049
lawyers review whether we could put

383
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,420
leaves in the mail or put kaledin

384
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:08,279
stamped onto paper in the mail and all

385
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,719
of them said no they said you can put

386
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,189
the DNA in the mail and you can put the

387
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,230
hemp stalk in the mail if it's been

388
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,730
sterilized but you can't put anything as

389
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,710
photosynthetic onto paper and ship it in

390
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,990
the mail I don't make these rules they

391
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,910
do seem a little silly but the fact is

392
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,320
we would rather move the problem to the

393
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,879
grow then move the problem to our

394
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,290
database where it will become a

395
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:29,009
collection of people who have violated

396
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:30,419
the CSA privacy is in fact an issue for

397
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,620
many people there are cannabis patents

398
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:33,319
emerging and a lot of them speak to

399
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,570
genetics so this keeps it in your hands

400
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,400
so this little device can then run tests

401
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,020
like for the B D allele we did a lot of

402
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,659
single molecule sequencing to figure out

403
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,549
what snips are driving the BD allele and

404
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,649
some folks in this audience Adrian who

405
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:48,240
actually helped champion this stuff at

406
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:50,549
medicinal genomics and many others

407
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,110
medicinal genomics this tells you

408
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:53,879
whether your plant is going to be a type

409
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,800
2 or type 3 they cannot discern between

410
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,179
the homozygous or heterozygous aid of a

411
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,529
functional CBD allele but it can tell

412
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:00,779
you that your plants got the potential

413
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:03,089
to make CBD and usually it's gonna be a

414
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,100
50/50 or a tall CBD strain if you're if

415
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,060
this thing turns yellow on you so if it

416
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,740
doesn't turn yellow

417
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,269
you are THC rich strain and you'll be

418
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,370
pink and oh look that's the blue dream

419
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,779
in the ak-47 you can see up there the

420
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,159
other thing we can tell is male versus

421
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,569
female from this we have assays that

422
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,039
target the white chromosome so you can

423
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,680
get a color change if something's

424
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,480
male or female and there's a few other

425
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,370
tests that we're working on a touch on

426
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,528
momentarily if you want to scale this up

427
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,419
we're working toward cheap ways

428
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:29,970
that will get this in 96-well format as

429
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,559
well these there are some thermal some

430
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,269
hot plates from from thermo that are

431
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,888
around for new bucks a piece that can

432
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:36,600
get you going on this but they don't

433
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:37,980
have automatic timers on them so they're

434
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,290
not as you have to kind of control those

435
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,209
yourself so we did bring this out to the

436
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:43,498
field to several beta trials and we're

437
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,568
very thankful I think many of them are

438
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:47,278
here Connecticut pharmaceuticals the

439
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:48,748
Slater Center in Colorado seeds helped

440
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,039
us in this and every one of those sites

441
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:51,808
we learn something and change the

442
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,039
primers accordingly and I would just

443
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:54,509
give you what on the most recent one

444
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,269
that occurred we went out says Colorado

445
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:59,430
seeds very recently and ran 47 known

446
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,749
males and 47 known females we could

447
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,789
visually confirm they were male and

448
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:04,649
female and we were able to get a hundred

449
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:07,078
percent accuracy off of that that trial

450
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:09,089
we've expanded this since then and that

451
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,318
accuracy is probably more like 95% from

452
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,360
what we're seeing when we go out to

453
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:14,399
numbers of 250 and it's very strange

454
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,769
specific there is another version of

455
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,480
trying to sex Sam seeds where you look

456
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,980
at the size of the seed and some folks

457
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,959
think that they can determine sex from

458
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,188
the size in the shape of the seed we

459
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,328
have a high discordance rate with that

460
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:25,828
we don't know what the answer is for

461
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:28,019
those those plants are still not mature

462
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:30,359
but if we look at our concordance

463
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,860
compared to what we did with knowns we

464
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,860
think the seed sizing probably is still

465
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,269
a bit of a coin toss now we also did

466
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,829
this in the BD allele we went and looked

467
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:39,659
for the BD allele which is the CBD

468
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:41,669
producing gene all over the country we

469
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:44,278
did many samples that Sonoma Labs helped

470
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:45,719
us capture out of the Emerald cup we

471
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:47,519
went to Colorado and looked at a hemp

472
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,079
farm out there and we all detect all of

473
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,938
those and we also looked at the ones in

474
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,278
Massachusetts we've not seen a fail yet

475
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:55,438
on CBD these are all the samples we've

476
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,659
tested to date with it so if your if

477
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:59,490
your genome is in there this test likely

478
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:01,230
works for it we're always open to scan

479
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,360
more there's possibility that there is

480
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,278
an unknown marker out there we've missed

481
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,680
now this can obviously extend to other

482
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,389
regulatory concerns we can go about and

483
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,489
test any presence/absence test that's a

484
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:12,870
concern with the plants so if you're

485
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,459
thinking about Aspergillus if you're

486
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,959
thinking about a coli or salmonella a

487
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,698
lot of the lot of the regulated labs

488
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,489
have to test for these things we're now

489
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:22,169
in the process of converting those into

490
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,629
yes/no color metric assays these can be

491
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:25,919
done both and third-party labs and done

492
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:28,379
locally which is probably how the

493
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,778
industry should mature eventually the

494
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,819
manufacturers will begin testing before

495
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:35,730
they ship two to two labs it's just the

496
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:37,799
right thing to do we have a grant from

497
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,178
NIDA as well to fund this to try and dry

498
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,370
some of this technology into picking up

499
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:40,990
the

500
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,539
Oh toxins that's gonna require some

501
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,480
immuno PCR and there's a bit more to be

502
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:48,789
spoken about that and next year so

503
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,170
genomic scales very well that's the one

504
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,730
thing I want to touch on there's plenty

505
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:53,799
of time for it if anyone's been

506
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,330
following this human genome curve that's

507
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,459
Moore's law that's looking really flat

508
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,320
and slow there well the the genomics

509
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,480
race has actually gone way past Moore's

510
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,040
law on this and this is going to apply

511
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,778
to what we're doing in this space with

512
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,569
this colorimetric assay can we scale

513
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:10,059
this down such that these 25 micro liter

514
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,190
wells can quickly move into 96-well

515
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:13,509
plates but we've already done that we've

516
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,550
already moved him into ten market leader

517
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:17,019
wells into three to four bolt plates so

518
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:19,088
you can see these cost curves are very

519
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,838
elastic and we're playing around with

520
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:24,310
the system that does 1536 wells and

521
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,410
these 1536 wells are 2 and 1/2

522
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:28,088
microliters this is not hard stuff this

523
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:30,819
is just repeating history we did this

524
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:32,620
before in 1996 these can go even down to

525
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,600
6 nano liter wells if you really want to

526
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,730
get micro fluidics involved I don't

527
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,019
think we need that because when you

528
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,480
think about the problem we're trying to

529
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:42,189
address if it's just 30 snips we just

530
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,659
need a log scale of reduction so that we

531
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,670
can get an entire genotype of a plant

532
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:47,289
point of grow in one of these assays so

533
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:48,729
you can imagine all you need is your

534
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:50,379
camera to just take a picture of this

535
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,759
and you can hit canopy do you know what

536
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,470
it is and while you're at it you should

537
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,208
throw an Aspergillus powdery mildew and

538
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,980
a handful of other markers that you

539
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:59,889
might want to get out of your grow which

540
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,600
brings us to powdery mildew this is not

541
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,429
what we thought it was we went through

542
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,870
the literature trying to make assays for

543
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:07,539
everything in the literature that might

544
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,458
be on the plants and so you'll see in

545
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:11,889
the literature alt Orca pee MACUL

546
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,630
heiress and Golovin mi sees we thought

547
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,459
it was at we made assays for it they all

548
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,110
failed it turns out it's a novel species

549
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,670
that exists on cannabis it's been

550
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,469
painstaking to get the genome sequence

551
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,579
of this has required a lot of special

552
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,380
care to make sure we don't get other

553
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:25,328
into fights and epiphytes in the process

554
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,339
of sequencing but the thing to know is

555
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:29,500
that this pest which is probably the

556
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,609
largest pest in the cannabis field when

557
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,079
it hits you it hits you at the worst

558
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:33,308
possible time at the end of your light

559
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,799
cycle when you spend all that time

560
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:38,500
growing the plants and it can it can

561
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,869
whack out 50% of your grow this thing's

562
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,880
vascularized in the plant and so it can

563
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:45,279
be there when you can't see it and the

564
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,080
DNA picks it up and so we decided to

565
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,569
make a hole-punch assay that would

566
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:51,579
actually target this genome so that we

567
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,700
can then see if we can eradicate this

568
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:55,699
from grows before become

569
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,950
a problem so we managed to scrape off

570
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,410
some of that white those spores off of

571
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,480
the leaves and shotgun sequence those

572
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,500
and then get ourselves a reference now

573
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,360
we've only done this in New England

574
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,460
samples there's a possibility that

575
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,619
there's another species out there out

576
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,240
west that we need to consider this is in

577
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:12,859
fact the case with wheat wheat has two

578
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,440
different bloom areas that exist on it

579
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:16,699
but cannabis so far this is the only

580
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,370
data we have right now is pointing to

581
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,400
this one strain and so far the numbers

582
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:24,109
on doing this look pretty good when we

583
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,490
run around with all the kilometers we've

584
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:26,629
had and look for the samples that are

585
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,069
clean and look for the samples that

586
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,990
aren't clean of it we get different

587
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:31,189
signals the clean samples stay pink and

588
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,079
the ones that have powdery mildew turn

589
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,490
yellow we've tried a few samples that

590
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,559
were in question and went through and

591
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,059
acts absolutely mutilated the samples to

592
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,259
see if we just under sampled the clean

593
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:41,779
ones and it was still there

594
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:44,539
it turns out the hyper sampling didn't

595
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:47,089
show us a new results so needless to say

596
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:48,470
we're still learning how frequently we

597
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:50,539
have to sample this to pick this up

598
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,450
because it is vascularized and we don't

599
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:54,769
know if we'll get it one hole punch but

600
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,210
at the moment right now it seems like we

601
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,710
are getting it with one hole punch the

602
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,880
question is are we going to capture it

603
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,380
when it's a clone are we gonna capture

604
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,210
it at 10 weeks or somewhere in the

605
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,260
middle we don't know yet we're hoping to

606
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,769
work with a lot of people in the field

607
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:08,539
to do that so finally we did begin

608
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,309
looking at other ways to genotype which

609
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:11,930
is using these portable sequencers and

610
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,849
this is still a work in progress but

611
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,400
STRs are becoming quite popular in the

612
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:17,359
field to use STRs to fingerprint some of

613
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,519
these strains and the reason people want

614
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,500
to do STRs is that they run a capillary

615
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,359
electrophoresis and they're really cheap

616
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,609
to run they can be under $1 to run per

617
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,379
STR but Capital Area lector Freese's is

618
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:29,359
a $50,000 instrument that's not field

619
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,310
portable so we want to take that

620
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,949
technology and move it to these field

621
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,359
portable sequencers so because one day

622
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,830
these field portable sequencers are

623
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,479
projecting to be as small as a little

624
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:40,460
chip that goes into an iPhone it's not

625
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,500
here yet but if it happens that could be

626
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,730
a very handy STR tool for field based

627
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,019
genotyping and we would want to

628
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,120
integrate that into the canopy dia

629
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:49,009
database if we have to the preliminary

630
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,179
data on this looks like there is still a

631
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:52,519
little bit of work to be done but it's

632
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,620
going to work these are STRs done out of

633
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,139
cannabis on nanopores and what you're

634
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:58,119
seeing in a lot of these is let me go

635
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,950
back to that I missed it

636
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,079
laser what you're seeing here that there

637
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,330
is is the SCR which is a it's a tandem

638
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:06,889
repeat and you'll see the tandem repeats

639
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,389
they're diff

640
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,130
because they're supposed to be these are

641
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,780
in fact the the variations were looking

642
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,580
for the other thing you'll notice is a

643
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,440
couple of the bases have error rates and

644
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,549
that's not actually unknown or not

645
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,230
uncommon with these nanopore sequencing

646
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,269
there's still at about ninety percent

647
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,710
accuracy a lot of depth of coverage

648
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,509
might correct a lot of that they're

649
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,190
getting better so I would say the the

650
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:26,569
verdict on this is still out stay tuned

651
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,580
but these are probably going to play a

652
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:29,869
role in doing pathogen detection or

653
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:30,379
other types of fingerprinting in the

654
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:33,859
future

655
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,990
so to summarize I am on red we think

656
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:37,490
under 30 stamps can actually genotype

657
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,870
samples we believe we're gonna be able

658
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,339
to put this point of bro we're out

659
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:41,959
looking for funding to expand this

660
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,759
genotyping technology so we can build

661
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,860
the right microfluidic chips that we

662
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,329
have to do this very cheaply on site and

663
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:48,679
we can hopefully include a variety of

664
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,990
other markers that would be of interest

665
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,850
and you see that marker list is growing

666
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,799
that marker list we have male female we

667
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:56,869
have CBD we have powdery mildew we're

668
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,940
looking into terpene markers and we're

669
00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:00,079
in likewise all the microbial risks but

670
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,029
we really want to open it up to the

671
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,009
community as to what do you want to look

672
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:05,629
for because the capacity to do

673
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,859
genome-wide Association studies means we

674
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,750
could do with probably two or three

675
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:11,149
hundred samples we may be able to find

676
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,180
markers for powdery mildew resistance or

677
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:16,040
drought resistance or name your QTL your

678
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,750
phenotype several hundred samples

679
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,789
sequenced in one condition or the other

680
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,230
we can hopefully distill a snip that can

681
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:23,149
make it to a point of growth system that

682
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,799
you'll be measuring on your phone so

683
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,750
with that I want to thank everyone who

684
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,460
made this happen which was a very large

685
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,549
group of people including people outside

686
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,380
of courtesan and missile genomics it was

687
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:35,119
a quite a fun era I'm the lucky

688
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,410
recipient to brag about it up here but

689
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,949
it's really not my work it's others

690
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,950
thank you

691
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,419
you
