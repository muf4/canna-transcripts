1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,080
well good morning

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,400
and i you know thank you for your

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,240
interest in this topic and i'm glad to

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,839
see all four of our panelists are here

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,719
uh to join in this discussion

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,000
um

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,038
you know

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,759
it's been two years since i had

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,199
suggested this topic to the organizers

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,000
of canmed

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,120
and a lot has really happened within

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
this particular area during that time

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,238
there's been a

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,920
growing interest in the field of

15
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:42,320
sustainability and how

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
it needs to be adopted

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,520
within this industry

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,399
so we have 60 minutes i really do hope

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,719
to have audience

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,359
participation so we will leave time

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,879
for questions

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,920
first i would like to move to introduce

23
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,239
our panelists i'll just do that

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,240
briefly and then they will introduce

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,600
themselves

26
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,599
we're

27
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,399
really lucky to have these four

28
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,759
individuals here because they cover a

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,478
big swath of the topics that can

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,438
fall under the hidden costs of cannabis

31
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,759
which is actually really broad

32
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,559
covering environmental

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,200
impacts as well as the

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,439
interface between the environmental

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,079
impacts and

36
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:38,319
human health so we have professor

37
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:41,519
william biswetti from north carolina who

38
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,199
has been fundamental in adding to our

39
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,840
understanding of

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,920
some of the biogenic volatile organic

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
compounds that

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,960
emanate from the

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,280
canopy of cannabis grows and has

44
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,239
involvement in how to mitigate

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
those

46
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,759
compounds

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,960
then we have professor

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,879
ted grantham from uc berkeley who has

49
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,919
been studying

50
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,399
water

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,878
issues related to

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,280
illicit cannabis growth within the state

53
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,399
of california and just the

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,640
increasing water demands for this

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,840
industry

56
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:25,439
we have david traylor who is going to

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,479
bring a unique aspect to the discussion

58
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,840
he's a biochemist turn

59
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,399
venture capitalist and he's been active

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,840
in funding efforts within the cannabis

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,400
space and he will offer his perspective

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,200
and on the market dynamics

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,959
and then we have professor max loong

64
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,229
who will be filling in on

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,400
the

66
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:51,840
[Music]

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,599
this interface between the environmental

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,878
impacts of cannabis and human health

69
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,598
so

70
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,919
the format that i've put together for

71
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:06,158
today and i just have a handful of

72
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:08,799
slides really more as condiments to

73
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,199
the discussion because it's really what

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
our panelists have to offer on these

75
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,919
topics

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,599
but you know there really hasn't been

77
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,799
any

78
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:22,959
systematic studies that have documented

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,200
the human environmental impact of

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,319
cannabis until quite recently there have

81
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,839
been a couple of new publications

82
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,039
and the first

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,878
bullet here has to do with a publication

84
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,959
that came out of colorado state

85
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:40,000
university

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,840
which was the first attempt to actually

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,560
quantitate

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,200
the greenhouse gas emissions from

89
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,158
cannabis grows and you can see we have

90
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:55,199
some really whopping numbers there

91
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:58,158
the equivalent of up to 3 million cars

92
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,479
then we'll also be able to address the

93
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:04,000
air pollution and odor

94
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:07,679
again from the bvocs

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,318
water waste and emerge emerging issue

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
for this industry and particularly here

97
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,280
in california

98
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,959
is the single use plastics that are so

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,839
widespread uh within this industry

100
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,800
that and the additional waste of the

101
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:29,039
throwaway of so much of the plant that's

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,680
not used uh including the roots

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,919
and then we'll look at this human health

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,360
impact so i would like to

105
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,039
to start

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,479
by asking each of the panelists to

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,199
while introducing themselves and telling

108
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,519
us how they got involved in the cannabis

109
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,120
industry but to

110
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,478
add comment

111
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,959
on these

112
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,439
topics for the current state of the

113
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,519
cannabis industry from their unique

114
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,719
perspective

115
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,279
so

116
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,280
whichever one of you would like to start

117
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,000
the discussion

118
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,319
well uh i'm david traylor

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,399
uh thanks everybody for being here so uh

120
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,240
sitting next to all these phds i feel

121
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,599
like that old sesame street song which

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,759
one of these doesn't belong with the

123
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,879
other

124
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,479
but so as she mentioned i have a

125
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,079
degree of science degrees got into

126
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,680
biotechnology i have 15 years

127
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,319
operational experience in biotech

128
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,918
companies in berlin boulder colorado

129
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,279
silicon valley

130
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,240
and then got on investment banking in

131
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:35,359
2005 and then i started my own firm in

132
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,879
2012 uh doing investment banking

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,879
and that's when colorado and washington

134
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,319
went legal so we started advising

135
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,000
companies so that we're the first

136
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,439
investment bank in the us to advise

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,478
cannabis companies

138
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,199
um

139
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,959
and then also certainly uh we've spoken

140
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,960
actually around the world we had our

141
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,399
first israeli client six years ago in

142
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,560
january

143
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,839
so i've spoken on cannabis in dubai

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,759
davos

145
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,198
generally world economic forum frankfurt

146
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,038
we're sponsoring event in berlin this

147
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,280
year and then around the u.s

148
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,279
thanks

149
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,918
hello uh my name is maxwell

150
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,918
i'm a new new assistant professor from

151
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,359
arizona state university i'm very

152
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,918
excited to be here

153
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,280
uh my background is also quite quite

154
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:22,719
quite unique you know compared to

155
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,879
you know other people i actually am a

156
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,400
state toxic state regulatory

157
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,279
toxicologist

158
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,758
uh

159
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,399
working with the california department

160
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,479
of pesticide regulation uh and also in

161
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,038
support of the regulation with the

162
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,000
california cannabis program

163
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,120
so

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,519
my main interest is in two area

165
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,399
one area is the impact

166
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,639
of

167
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,439
environmental contaminants

168
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,120
in medical use so usually when people

169
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,439
talk about environmental impact they

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
wouldn't think that okay may kill some

171
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,279
animal down the street it has nothing to

172
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,960
do with me well cannabis is a

173
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,959
sequestering plant

174
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,359
that means that the environmental

175
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,959
contaminants in the environment

176
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
including pesticide

177
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,120
toxic elements and also microbial

178
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,399
contaminants it will be sequestered in

179
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,639
the planet by actually affecting our use

180
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,478
for medical purposes

181
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,598
now another area that i'm very

182
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,360
interested in is the uh what i call

183
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,120
positive uses

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
of cannabis certified

185
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,038
for the environment so

186
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,199
now there's this cousin of cannabis hemp

187
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,879
which you know contain very low level of

188
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,478
txt uh now right now we are from uh a

189
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,399
lot of there's a lot of research on the

190
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,560
environmental impact but i'm

191
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,679
more interested in the environmental

192
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,120
application of say using ham to remove

193
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,160
contaminants from the environment some

194
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,560
a process we call vital remediation uh

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,199
and also potentially using hem uh to

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,680
capture a co2 uh something called a

197
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,360
carbon offset uh you know process that

198
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,079
uh have under a lot of interest is

199
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,280
biochar so uh very excited to be here

200
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,279
and talk to you all thank you

201
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,400
thanks good morning everyone so i'm ted

202
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,598
grantham i'm a professor in the

203
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,638
environmental science policy and

204
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,800
management department at uc berkeley and

205
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,560
about five years ago i was involved in

206
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
the establishment of a new research

207
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,839
center at uc berkeley called the

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,759
cannabis research center and it

209
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,038
basically brought together a group of

210
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,280
faculty that were interested in

211
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,878
different dimensions of cannabis

212
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,318
research and i think

213
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
one of the

214
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,278
distinguishing aspects of our center is

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,639
that we're focusing much more on the

216
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,000
cultivation side and less on the

217
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,838
sort of biomedical dimensions that are

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,918
being addressed in this conference but

219
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,839
we saw a real need to get a better

220
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,360
understanding of how cannabis is being

221
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,760
cultivated in the state of california

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,519
with the passage of prop 64

223
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,919
to ensure that you know the policies

224
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,240
that were being developed um you know

225
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,838
made sense made you know

226
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,919
reflected reality on the ground and

227
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,560
we're going to be um ultimately be

228
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,079
successful so we we broadly at the

229
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,679
center focus on the sort of

230
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,959
environmental social

231
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,719
um

232
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,399
and policy dimensions of cannabis

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,839
primarily focusing on california that we

234
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,799
do collaborate with others outside of

235
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,040
the state

236
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,919
and um you know as i mentioned we really

237
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,559
study cannabis as a agricultural

238
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:22,159
commodity you know rather than

239
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:24,000
you know a federally restricted drug

240
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,000
and our team includes you know

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
economists ecologists

242
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,080
anthropologists legal scholars i'm

243
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,839
actually an ecologist and hydrologist by

244
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,759
by training so definitely an outlier

245
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,920
here i think but i'm really happy to be

246
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,519
part of the conversation

247
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,679
i just want to quickly comment on some

248
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,560
of our work around water in particular

249
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,278
when

250
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,399
the state developed its regulations

251
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,080
around

252
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,799
cannabis cultivation

253
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,200
there's a lot of attention given to

254
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,958
the use of water potential environmental

255
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,120
impacts associated with water resources

256
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,319
and there had been some some studies

257
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,959
some

258
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,920
sort of anecdotal anecdotal evidence

259
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,599
that

260
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,759
cannabis water use was having a negative

261
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
impact on

262
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,480
some of the sensitive species we find in

263
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,160
the state like you know some of the

264
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,159
salmon and

265
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,519
other other sensitive species

266
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,919
particularly in northern california

267
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,399
which is the historical epicenter of

268
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,240
cannabis cultivation in the state and so

269
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,919
for this reason the

270
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,399
the state developed very stringent

271
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,319
requirements intended to mitigate

272
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,679
potential impacts of

273
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,320
of water use

274
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,679
um but they really developed this those

275
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
are these policies without actually

276
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,759
knowing very much about how water was

277
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,680
actually being used and so we saw a need

278
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,039
to sort of fill this this knowledge gap

279
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,719
and address very you know i think

280
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,879
fundamental questions basic questions

281
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,240
around around cannabis water use where

282
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,399
where does cannabis source their water

283
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,240
how much water they're using and what

284
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,159
context how how does that vary by

285
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,440
different cultivation types for example

286
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,199
then of course

287
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,880
what are the environmental impacts and

288
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
so i'll just briefly mention some of the

289
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,720
findings that we've

290
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
sort of developed over the you know

291
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
realized over the last couple of years

292
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
you know first off

293
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
there's no evidence that cannabis is a

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,879
particularly thirsty crop despite some

295
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,959
portrayals in in the media

296
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,120
when you look at cannabis water use you

297
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,119
know per you know per acre or whatever

298
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,480
unit of air you want it's really on par

299
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,360
with many other conventional

300
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,800
agricultural crops

301
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
we have found however that there is

302
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,639
really substantial variation in

303
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,159
water use by bicultivators

304
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,000
you know in some cases even orders of

305
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,639
magnitude for a given size and so there

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,278
seems to be um a lot of

307
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,360
variation in in in water use practices

308
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,439
that we don't yet fully understand and

309
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,759
this really points to i think a broader

310
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,519
need not just to water but for really

311
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,200
standardization and the establishment of

312
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,000
best management practices from

313
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,600
everything from water to pesticide use

314
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,360
um and other other aspects of

315
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,839
cultivation that just that exists for

316
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,000
pretty much every other crop

317
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,240
in you know in the state and beyond but

318
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,720
but it's not yet for california

319
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,839
um there's two other comments one we

320
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,278
found that

321
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,680
you know when we look at cannabis water

322
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,159
use relative to all agricultural use in

323
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,799
the in the state it's less than you know

324
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,958
a fraction of one percent so it's a tiny

325
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,000
volume of waters being used for cannabis

326
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,399
relative to all of their crops

327
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
but i will say there is still concern

328
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,320
about cannabis impacts

329
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,839
in certain contexts and this could

330
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,000
include some of the places in northern

331
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,320
california these smaller watersheds

332
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,278
where water is naturally quite limited

333
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,440
and these are the places where we um

334
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,120
what we might expect to see potential

335
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,880
for you know for impact so it's really

336
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,879
all about context um and

337
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,519
um so i think in some cases we've seen

338
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,039
sort of a maybe an overestimation or

339
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,480
portrayal of potential impacts but in

340
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,480
other cases there are real causes for

341
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,159
concern that we'll continue to

342
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,240
to research so i'll just i'll just maybe

343
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,319
close by mentioning that we're also

344
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
studying a host of other sort of

345
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,760
environmental dimensions of cannabis

346
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,639
including wildlife and wildfire and

347
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:06,000
greenhouse gas emissions and and and the

348
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,240
nexus of these concerns with with state

349
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,159
policy and regulations and so encourage

350
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
you to check out our research center and

351
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,838
papers

352
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,759
at you know our website which is again

353
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,279
crc.berkeley.edu

354
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,480
thanks

355
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,078
wonderful

356
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
good morning everyone hey i'm will

357
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,000
vesueta i'm a full professor of

358
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,519
environmental engineering uh at

359
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,600
university of north carolina in chapel

360
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,679
hill i'm in the school of public health

361
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,440
there so we're a bunch of engineers and

362
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,599
scientists interested in solving public

363
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,959
health problems uh and the public health

364
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,278
problem i'm most interested in solving

365
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,119
is air quality so for the last

366
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,039
17 years or so i've been studying the

367
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,959
connection between exposure to air

368
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,319
quality and its connection to human

369
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,000
health

370
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,278
one of the ways that we understand how

371
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,879
air pollution is formed in the

372
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,000
atmosphere is understanding the

373
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:54,000
interaction of volatile bio biogenic

374
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,559
volatile organic compounds so you off

375
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,879
called mono terpenes sesquiterpenes and

376
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,559
isoprene it's one of the biggest inputs

377
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,240
from terrestrial vegetation into the

378
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,078
atmosphere and if we don't understand

379
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,000
the emissions of those plants we don't

380
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,239
get a good sense of modeling for air

381
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,639
pollution or our exposure and that's

382
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,079
what kind of brought me to this field

383
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,360
and so i

384
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,799
when i found out those decades or so ago

385
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,959
there was going to be legalization in a

386
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,319
lot of these states i was just curious

387
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,719
and i thought well wonder what the

388
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,240
emissions of all the organic compounds

389
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
are from these

390
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,799
cultivation facilities and is it the

391
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,800
magnitude of which that could rival

392
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,958
other industries and have an impact on

393
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,958
regional air quality and when i looked

394
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,958
up the emission factors for cannabis

395
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,958
there were none it didn't exist

396
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,239
absolutely zero because it's a federally

397
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,439
illicit substance the epa noaa nsf all

398
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,519
these federal agencies that would

399
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,040
normally be providing that information

400
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,198
which you could look up for your car you

401
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,278
could look up for a gas station did not

402
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,799
exist at the time and so i got some

403
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,559
federal funding i had to fly out of

404
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,000
north carolina actually and go to the

405
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,559
national center for atmospheric research

406
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,720
in colorado where this stuff was legal

407
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,719
and i published the very first paper on

408
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,879
emission factors volatile compounds the

409
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,360
emissions of gases that come from these

410
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,039
plants while they're growing

411
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,639
that spun up a few papers and we also

412
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,278
did a modeling study where we modeled

413
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,440
the entire cannabis industry as a whole

414
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,439
in denver to see its impact on air

415
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,440
quality in colorado

416
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,839
since that time i've done other studies

417
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,760
in canada and california i know it's

418
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,839
been difficult as my academic colleagues

419
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,240
would probably attest to to get federal

420
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,839
funding to do any research in this area

421
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
and so i kind of abandoned it actually

422
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,680
in my academic research and i spun off a

423
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,320
company and that's what buyer scientific

424
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,000
is and so within buyer scientific we use

425
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,240
a lot of the same methodology and

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,720
scientific knowledge that we have from

427
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,639
studying the last 40 years all these

428
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,879
other plans we've now applied it to the

429
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,240
cannabis industry and just some things

430
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,720
that i found out is actually quite

431
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,320
fascinating is the cannabis plant is

432
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,000
actually the most fascinating plant i've

433
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,079
ever studied in my entire life and

434
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,399
several other scientists have tested

435
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,239
that as well when you study tomatoes or

436
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,919
pine trees or these other things you

437
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,839
kind of get a profile of the emissions

438
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,000
that they have what we found with the

439
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,519
cannabis plant is that it varies widely

440
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,039
by strain most folks probably already

441
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,639
know that in this room but it's really

442
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,719
kind of unprecedented for other plants

443
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,120
to have such a wide variety of different

444
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,278
profiles of kinds of mono terpenes and

445
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,198
amounts depending on both strain and

446
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,278
life cycle of the plant

447
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,120
which means that every facility that has

448
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,198
its own unique number of strains and

449
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,759
number of plants actually has its own

450
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,359
unique profile of monoterpene susport

451
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,600
terpenes that are being emitted out of

452
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,440
that facility into the atmosphere so

453
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
that actually makes it very difficult to

454
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,120
assess and regulate and come up with an

455
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,039
inventory that's accurate for the

456
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,039
cultivation of cannabis

457
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,360
the other thing that we found was that

458
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,519
not just in the cultivation i.e in the

459
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,839
vegetative and the flowering rooms but

460
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,078
also post-harvest is a

461
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,399
significant source of emissions of these

462
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,078
biogenic volatile organic compounds

463
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,320
the harvesting especially if you're

464
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,879
doing mechanical trimming tends to

465
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,639
create a lot of emissions of vocs and so

466
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,480
if you're trying to assess an inventory

467
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,120
of the total emission inventory into the

468
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,038
atmosphere from cannabis facilities you

469
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,798
not only have to include cultivation you

470
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,640
also have to include both drying

471
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,798
post-processing harvesting all those

472
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,880
other activities to really get a sense

473
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,078
of what the emissions are into the

474
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,919
atmosphere

475
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,438
and i'll end on you know

476
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,038
there's been a lot of talk here about

477
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,120
the benefits of

478
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,798
monoterpenes and they certainly are

479
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,879
beneficial there's nothing toxic that

480
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,679
i've ever seen about breathing in

481
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,120
monoterpenes or sex terpenes what

482
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,200
happens is when these monoterpenes and

483
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,439
sesquiterpenes enter the atmosphere they

484
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,360
undergo oxidation the same oxidation

485
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,440
process actually that we just saw in the

486
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,399
previous talk the hydroxyl radicals in

487
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,080
the atmosphere oxidize these things and

488
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,200
they turn into other things that are not

489
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,879
nice formaldehyde carbonyls aldehydes

490
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,120
things that are not good for you but

491
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,960
they also produce ozone and particulate

492
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,879
matter and ozone and particulate matter

493
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,720
specifically are none of the number one

494
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,880
killers do of air pollution exposure in

495
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,400
the atmosphere and so it's not the

496
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,160
actual vocs themselves but the process

497
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,720
atmospheric chemistry that results in

498
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,160
the ozone npm that they produce and that

499
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,079
could happen both in an indoor

500
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,759
environment as well as an outdoor

501
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,000
environment and that depends on a lot of

502
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,759
other things that allows us which is why

503
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,839
we run these models to try to understand

504
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,798
that so and lastly i think we'll talk

505
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,639
about odor odor is also a result of a

506
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,200
gas phase molecule that's coming from

507
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,960
these plants and through our research at

508
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,880
buyer scientific we're able to identify

509
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,038
the odor molecule that's causing that

510
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,360
skunky odor in the spoiler it's not the

511
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,839
terpenes

512
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,798
okay thank you all for your

513
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,959
initial comments so you know following

514
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,960
this

515
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,440
discussion

516
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,360
you know there are no existing

517
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,840
guidelines specifically for cannabis

518
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,558
grow facilities but i know a lot of

519
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:58,879
states colorado california

520
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:00,319
are considering those um and i'm curious

521
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,600
you know what

522
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,000
the panel

523
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,918
thinks the timeline will be

524
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,119
until we see

525
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,759
uh

526
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,558
guidelines published at the state level

527
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,440
for

528
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,918
either emissions

529
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,038
water effluent

530
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,919
treatment or testing

531
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,240
and

532
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,960
just general more oversight over the the

533
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,720
industry to monitor and the you know the

534
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,038
issue with the volatiles so you can

535
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,000
smell them but you can't see them

536
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,519
whatever's going into the

537
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,359
waste water

538
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,759
we don't really know it goes to the

539
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,839
water treatment facility and they're not

540
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,879
set up to remove

541
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,079
residual pesticides and so i'm just

542
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,600
curious

543
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,480
what you

544
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,719
collectively think the timeline will be

545
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,319
before we see

546
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,319
restrictions being imposed

547
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,480
well that's a good question

548
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,000
one thing i wanted to mention maybe it's

549
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,000
a good thing for me to go back to is

550
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,440
kind of the history of cannabis and

551
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,599
cultivation

552
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,679
i think i'm uniquely qualified to talk

553
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,759
about that one that i worked in

554
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,440
bioprocessing two leading biotech

555
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,839
companies in boulder i have two patents

556
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,519
in bioprocessing from the result

557
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,678
and if you look at cannabis that's what

558
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:23,038
cannabis is right this is a biological

559
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,798
supply chain right it turns out i also

560
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,919
was chief business officer at cerna

561
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,679
which is one of the first public

562
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,600
companies in the space cerna made

563
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,519
climate control systems for indoor grow

564
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,678
operations

565
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,480
and when you look at it the history of

566
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,400
cultivation cannabis

567
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
you can get definitely get much better

568
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,240
and to answer

569
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,919
my thought on cindy's question is

570
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,919
frankly i don't think it's really going

571
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
to be driven by

572
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,759
regulations it's going to be driven by

573
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,880
economics and it's going to be driven by

574
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,240
people not being so stupid frankly

575
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,679
i mean

576
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,279
you can look it up there's quoted in

577
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,038
bloomberg one time there's been too much

578
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,038
arrogance and too little humility in

579
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,400
this industry

580
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,960
case in point

581
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,280
uh there's a big uh lp out of canada

582
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,600
that just recently closed their large

583
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,119
uh cultivation facility turns out it

584
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,678
wasn't because of oversupply it's

585
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,759
because they sourced bad steel from

586
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,280
china and it was flaking off into the

587
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,038
product right

588
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,319
we also recently talked to a group out

589
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,240
of cyprus that wants to use hydroponics

590
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,839
to grow industrial hemp which is

591
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,038
probably the one of the dumbest ideas

592
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,319
you've ever heard

593
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,240
uh so

594
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,759
i think what we're what we believe is

595
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,480
it's going to be really starting to be

596
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,759
driven by economics uh for example you

597
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,839
know you guys have probably heard you

598
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,200
know we have indoor grow ops those are

599
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,798
going to probably start going away

600
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,919
you're going to be starting to do more

601
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,519
outdoor uh grow ups and then you're also

602
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,000
seeing a lot of things being driven by

603
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,558
what we call apt or alternative

604
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,679
production technologies using e coli

605
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,519
using yeast using just chemistry uh or

606
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,480
even just doing outdoor grow ops so we

607
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,240
believe

608
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,400
that this industry and the cultivation

609
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,720
the production of cannabinoids is really

610
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,720
going to be driven by the economics of

611
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,279
the market and frankly less so the

612
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,919
regulation

613
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,879
i also want to comment on the timeline

614
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,320
for environmental regulation in general

615
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,760
i think there are two

616
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,599
key factors here one is federal legal

617
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,119
federal legalization

618
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,199
so

619
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,119
for example if i go to

620
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,798
whole food to buy a watermelon

621
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,879
okay i wouldn't expect you know the

622
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,200
watermelon to be loaded with pesticide

623
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,320
and all the other contaminants because

624
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,400
all the food you know like

625
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,798
pharmaceutical of course but there are

626
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,759
variable regulations that come to

627
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:42,000
regulate and most importantly

628
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,599
make the information available for

629
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,079
what is the

630
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,240
level of contaminants you would expect

631
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,000
in that commodity

632
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,000
what do we need to test for that

633
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,919
particular commodity

634
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,519
what are the risks that are associated

635
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,080
with those exposure

636
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,319
uh with cannabis that is uh that is

637
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,678
non-existent at the federal level

638
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:06,319
because cannabis is still regulated uh

639
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,240
as a schedule one substance

640
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,480
and then a lot of those regulations you

641
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,440
know because of that is not in place you

642
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,440
know you don't have you know usdpa fda

643
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,360
and all to regulate this because they

644
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,640
basically treat that as a illegal

645
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,918
substance

646
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,919
now another aspect i would agree with uh

647
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,159
the other panelists here about to

648
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,440
comment on the importance of the

649
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,679
industry uh you know to this because

650
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,120
you think about it like right now uh

651
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,240
cannabis uh contaminant regulation uh is

652
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,439
done uh on the basis of state by state

653
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,440
regulation

654
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,679
so really if different state you know

655
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,919
like there's no you know communication

656
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,720
between them there's no interaction with

657
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,360
the industry across multiple states

658
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,159
this is not going to change unless we

659
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,519
actually have federal legalization so so

660
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,880
i think the interaction between the

661
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,879
industry and also you know like

662
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,159
different uh stakeholder at the state

663
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
you know like if the analytical

664
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,679
chemistry

665
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,400
is key to the timeline

666
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,519
for

667
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,519
environmental regulation

668
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,480
i guess i'll just speak to the

669
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,720
california perspective and start with

670
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,880
the recognition that you know cannabis

671
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,798
is subject to currently to the most

672
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,120
stringent environmental requirements of

673
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,798
any agricultural crop in the state

674
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,399
something that i'm sure many folks in

675
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,599
this room are well

676
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,679
well aware of and so while i i think

677
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,079
there is a need to

678
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,919
establish standardized practices and

679
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,639
guidelines to address environmental

680
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,640
impacts i think

681
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
i don't think it actually would be very

682
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,440
wise for the state to impose new new

683
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,199
restrictions on cannabis particularly

684
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,880
given the challenges that the state is

685
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,120
already facing in bringing growers into

686
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,278
the regulated market

687
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,119
one of the things that we've um

688
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,119
commented on and written extensively

689
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,759
about are are the fact that there are

690
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:01,359
just substantial barriers to compliance

691
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:03,599
for for for growers associated with

692
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,519
these um with with the regulatory

693
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,798
framework and and the environment is is

694
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,079
part of that there are some issues with

695
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,200
with water where i think policy

696
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,798
improvements

697
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
might help lower those barriers to

698
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,400
compliance but you know there's been

699
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,840
some discussion of those market forces

700
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,720
but you know also issues related to

701
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,959
local local control in particular um

702
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,839
that that i think are really

703
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,519
getting in the way of a successful legal

704
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,720
legal market so

705
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,960
i guess i'll just say well i think there

706
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,558
is a need to standardize and develop

707
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,798
guidelines to address potential

708
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,319
environmental impacts i think the best

709
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,240
path forward in the short term would be

710
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,960
through voluntary certificate programs

711
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,278
for example that would

712
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,278
that would encourage growers to use use

713
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,200
best practices and signal to consumers

714
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,278
that best practices are being used

715
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,600
rather than by taking a regulatory

716
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,359
approach

717
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:52,959
you have great comments from my

718
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,199
panelists here so i'll speak

719
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,679
specifically to two subjects one is air

720
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,960
quality and the other is odor

721
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,360
air quality is kind of a brighter

722
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,200
picture i mean folks are you're asking

723
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,719
when regulations happen it's happening

724
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,919
now every time there goes a license

725
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,038
comes up

726
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,880
they're asking for environmental

727
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,798
assessments now luckily we have the

728
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,840
tools and technologies and methods to

729
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,759
assess air quality um from this industry

730
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,439
or any other industry the issue with

731
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,440
this industry is that we miss are

732
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,440
missing those emission factors if i was

733
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,038
opening up a gas station i could look up

734
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,960
an emission factor for decreasing an

735
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,119
engine i could put it into existing

736
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,079
regulatory models i could see if that

737
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,599
passes the regulatory permit or not um

738
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,038
everything exists for that for the

739
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,798
cannabis industry except for the

740
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,240
emission factor which is what we've been

741
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,079
trying to focus on for the past so um is

742
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,440
it important to run those models to do

743
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,879
those systems to understand where

744
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,960
there's an air quality impact yes do

745
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,278
those systems already exist yes what's

746
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,519
missing is just the data and we would

747
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,359
have that data if epa was studying this

748
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,119
stuff now on the outer side it's a

749
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,439
little different there there aren't

750
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,519
really any standards for odor

751
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,360
right now and so most folks when they're

752
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,440
trying to issue licenses are saying we

753
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,519
don't ever want to have an odor right

754
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,600
and we're even further behind in that

755
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,038
than we are on air quality as far as how

756
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,278
to mitigate it understanding what's even

757
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,000
causing the odor or in the inherent

758
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,440
subjectivity of that odor and so how

759
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,278
we're trying to approach it and buy our

760
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,519
scientific is now that we've identified

761
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,720
the molecule that's causing that odor we

762
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,359
have

763
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,919
engineered all our molecular cap

764
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,199
capture systems to specifically go after

765
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,360
the standards because we know what the

766
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,480
molecule is and so the hope is to have a

767
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,918
zero uh impact odor as far as that but

768
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,519
these things are happening now and until

769
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,960
we get some federal legalization and

770
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,720
some help from the federal government

771
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,399
it's going to be ad hoc county by county

772
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,360
state by state and it's going to be

773
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,079
difficult and it's going to create

774
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,158
barriers to market

775
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,759
okay thank you and

776
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,120
really uh

777
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:51,119
sort of drilling down on this same topic

778
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,398
on a

779
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:57,678
lack of federal oversight and

780
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:59,678
a patchwork of state regulations

781
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,600
the focus has been turning to

782
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,320
sustainability

783
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:07,119
in colorado the city of denver has

784
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:10,158
established a cannabis sustainability

785
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:13,199
group and they've actually published a

786
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,000
document which is pretty impressive

787
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,798
and

788
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,839
clearly i think the industry is on a

789
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,038
path to

790
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:24,319
adopting more sustainability measures

791
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,960
but there are barriers to that obviously

792
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:30,798
um and we just talked about lack of

793
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,240
regulations or needed regulations

794
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:37,839
but there's also the need for innovation

795
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,359
and alternative technologies and maybe

796
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:43,519
incentives and maybe the incentives are

797
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,000
economic largely

798
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,960
whether through the cost of additional

799
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,119
imposed regulations or just through

800
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,200
consumer demand

801
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,000
for the industry to become more

802
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,679
sustainable again i bring up this issue

803
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,038
of single-use plastics it's it's huge

804
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,840
all these

805
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,038
requirements for packaging for child

806
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,398
resistant

807
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,759
containers

808
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:11,439
so i i'd like to ask the panel their

809
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,480
thoughts on

810
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,000
on how

811
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,360
quickly or

812
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,960
what are the barriers for sustainability

813
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,959
for the cannabis industry

814
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,319
well that's a good

815
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,919
question i think again it's probably

816
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,918
going to be

817
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,799
more driven by

818
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,960
economics and like for example

819
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,200
i think one of the big questions

820
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,399
that we see is is what is cultivation

821
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,159
going to be in the future and where is

822
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,119
it going to be located right i mean for

823
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,919
example

824
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,798
uh you have i mean we are in la right

825
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,799
and i'm from colorado and a lot of our

826
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,839
our water from colorado goes to the la

827
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,679
aqueduct right so it's right now we have

828
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,359
as we pointed out on the panel before we

829
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,519
haven't really solved the water problem

830
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,199
and that's a big sustainability issue

831
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,440
but with that in mind i think probably

832
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,278
cultivation is going to move to

833
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,038
places that are more amenable like for

834
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,278
example

835
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,798
to us there's two big questions

836
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,480
geography

837
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,319
and and we look at this as a global

838
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,640
perspective right so

839
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,119
we've talked to operators that want to

840
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,038
grow in the canary islands and they want

841
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:20,000
to go grow in jersey

842
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:23,119
uh the jersey islands greece lesotho and

843
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,640
south africa colombia right so where is

844
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,239
that going to be i mean colombia

845
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,960
everybody assumed that that was going to

846
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,079
be

847
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,079
uh you know the the solution to growing

848
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,000
because you can grow year round it's in

849
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,839
the equator but it turns out a lot of

850
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,679
the public companies down there have got

851
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,119
their clocks cleaned right so that's a

852
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,519
big question and then getting back to

853
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,359
the alternative production technologies

854
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,398
uh there's a lot of companies demetrics

855
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,398
i believe is a sponsor here um

856
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,719
they're you know we're talking to a

857
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,558
company actually in

858
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,720
south carolina it's generating

859
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,200
apis active pharmaceutical ingredients

860
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,600
from a phytosource from actually uh

861
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,440
cannabis so the other question is you

862
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,199
know what where is that going to go and

863
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,399
our belief is

864
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,319
that the way the production of cannabis

865
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,798
in the future or cannabinoids let's just

866
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,639
put it that way is going to be driven by

867
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:13,839
the best way to make the highest quality

868
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,360
molecules

869
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,798
full stop whether that involves a

870
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,639
phytosource or

871
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,398
or an alternate production technology or

872
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,038
combination thereof we believe that's

873
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,639
that's where it's headed

874
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,519
um i think the

875
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,000
uh biggest challenge uh related to

876
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,440
sustainability is that we need to start

877
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,398
thinking about

878
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,278
uh

879
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,918
you know

880
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,038
the environmental impact of cannabis you

881
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,799
know from the environment to the

882
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,798
environmental application

883
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,278
of it uh so

884
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,158
uh for instance i talk about you know

885
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,480
the

886
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,240
potential of using hem to

887
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,720
remove

888
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,440
contaminants from the environment

889
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,319
there's also opportunity to use

890
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,840
use it as a tools for carbon offset so

891
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,480
those research

892
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,079
because for both cannabis and ham the

893
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,519
both of them have just been legalized to

894
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:07,359
grow in the u.s so more focused on how

895
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,359
do we actually use it

896
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,519
in addition to you know like how does it

897
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,119
cause the environment right and other

898
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,798
elements farm ways you know also what do

899
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,119
we do with farmweek well

900
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,599
we will figure out how to do it uh with

901
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:22,319
deposit of biochar that can turn out to

902
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,079
be a process with capturing co2 so so

903
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,960
thinking about the application side you

904
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:30,000
know like as well as the impact side is

905
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,278
key another part i want to talk about is

906
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,278
the um

907
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:36,640
the we need a better understanding with

908
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:39,359
the biology of the crop now for instance

909
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,159
if you're thinking about growing

910
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:45,038
cannabis you know in the u.s a lot of

911
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,399
the production is in the in-house but uh

912
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,359
if you're thinking about growing it

913
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:52,079
outdoor right now we don't have a string

914
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:55,119
of uh either cannabis or ham that are

915
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,439
selected specifically to grow in the u.s

916
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:59,518
climate we do it chrome background but

917
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,640
once you take it outside the control

918
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,599
environment

919
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,240
uh where would we get uh you know that

920
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,839
productivity out of it you know uh you

921
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,679
know very little information about it in

922
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,639
fact this is actually one of my key

923
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,919
research questions because for me if i'm

924
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,880
if i'm wanting to

925
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,120
use hem to remove our environmental

926
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,000
pollutant there's a lot of toxic element

927
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,158
in

928
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,398
arizona

929
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,919
how do we even grow ham where should we

930
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,678
put it

931
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,960
very little information is available

932
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,559
right now and one of the things that we

933
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,319
do know is that

934
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:35,119
we are not actually having the white

935
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:37,678
biology uh we don't have it out of this

936
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:40,479
particular crop option yet

937
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,679
for it to be worldwide in our state so i

938
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,759
think a better understanding of the

939
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,038
biology of the crop is also key with its

940
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,038
use with sustainability

941
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,879
okay so just offer the perspective that

942
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,440
i think the potential for sustainability

943
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,919
in the cannabis industry sort of relies

944
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,960
entirely on the viability of the legal

945
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,880
market and of course you know federal is

946
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,240
nothing you know federal legalization is

947
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,000
is is really the only is the primary

948
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,280
sort of obstacle i think to a viable

949
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,559
market but i think there's still a lot

950
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,639
that the state

951
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,000
the state can do

952
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,838
to

953
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,878
to lower barriers

954
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,878
to to access to help the system work

955
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,799
more more efficiently i mean there are

956
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,918
certainly issues related to you know

957
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,440
sort of financial barriers um the

958
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,598
taxation that occurs from you know local

959
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,159
state to state levels from consumer i

960
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,440
mean from cultivation to distribution

961
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,440
that can certainly be addressed

962
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,309
one of the things that we found in our

963
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,440
research is that there seems to be a

964
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:44,960
[Music]

965
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,679
sort of a

966
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,039
geographic and scale transition in where

967
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,838
and how cannabis is being grown in

968
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,679
california from away from sort of

969
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,960
small-scale production again primarily

970
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,280
in the north coast but other parts of

971
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,639
the state as well to larger scale

972
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
production

973
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:03,279
predominantly in the central coast in

974
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,960
areas a little bit closer to to consumer

975
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,400
centers

976
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,920
now this isn't necessarily about a good

977
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,160
thing but i'll just say that you know

978
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,639
one of the original intents of prop 64

979
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,639
was to

980
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,200
to help transition these sort of

981
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,880
historical legacy grows into into the

982
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,960
legal market and sort of preserve the

983
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,720
sort of the potential for small-scale

984
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,679
farming to be to be viable and i think

985
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,319
that's really critical when we think

986
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,679
about the sustainability of the industry

987
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,440
and the way that cannabis is being grown

988
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:32,159
in the state and there seems to be signs

989
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,240
that we may be moving towards more sort

990
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:38,480
of models of industrial agriculture for

991
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:41,118
cannabis cultivation that has well-known

992
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,358
negative environmental you know social

993
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,559
economic impacts that

994
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,159
that i think should be concerned for

995
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,920
anyone trying to

996
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,598
move this industry towards towards a

997
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,079
more sustainable

998
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,680
practice thanks

999
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,800
great yeah it's great always being last

1000
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,919
on these panels right now i think it's

1001
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,039
something to say

1002
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,559
so you know the thing about

1003
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,960
sustainability from my standpoint is

1004
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,559
focus on uh community air pollution

1005
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,240
right either exposure if you're a

1006
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,679
cultivation in a community you want to

1007
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:07,519
be a good community neighbor right you

1008
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,279
don't want to be producing uh air

1009
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,800
pollution right also community health

1010
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,800
right the workers that are working in

1011
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,039
these facilities and ex what they're

1012
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,800
exposed to we're also interested in but

1013
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,759
also energy usage right so if you're

1014
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,200
going to be uh filtrating out these uh

1015
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,280
chemicals that are being emitted by the

1016
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,519
plants you want to be able to design a

1017
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,960
filtration system that takes out just

1018
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,159
enough and not too much right you don't

1019
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,400
over design you don't want to under

1020
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,598
design and so i'm trained as a chemical

1021
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,039
engineer and i've always been taught

1022
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,640
that you need data to understand the

1023
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,880
problem and so i think that's one of the

1024
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,879
barriers that we have to developing the

1025
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,720
solutions and technological as well as

1026
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,960
legal solutions for these problems is

1027
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,239
our lack of data right and so we're

1028
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,679
trying to address that in buyer

1029
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,919
scientific where we're looking at the

1030
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,838
gas phase emissions from these plants to

1031
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,440
understand exactly how much is being

1032
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,239
emitted by these plants so then we can

1033
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,400
design systems that oh exactly breathe

1034
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,159
out in what the plants are breathing out

1035
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,760
no more and no less

1036
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,199
also have a sense of how much of

1037
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,119
molecules are coming out of the odor

1038
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,879
molecules if you have those and you can

1039
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,559
use models to see where things are going

1040
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,200
to see where hot spots are occurring and

1041
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,719
you can assess efficacy of your controls

1042
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,879
so i think in addition to what my

1043
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,399
panelists have said i think having data

1044
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,800
scientific data

1045
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,519
is critical and it's one of the big gaps

1046
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,519
in this industry

1047
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,960
yes thank you so much um

1048
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:27,679
you know one of the ways industries move

1049
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,079
forward is through innovation

1050
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,559
and you know i started this list two

1051
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,960
years ago for this panel and of course

1052
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:38,880
now led light lighting is is so common

1053
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,838
and it

1054
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,519
in in some states lighting requirements

1055
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,119
are in place i know

1056
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,599
in colorado

1057
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,640
a movement again to

1058
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,440
move away from the wastefulness of this

1059
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:56,559
industry where

1060
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,400
the incorporation of living soil systems

1061
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,400
where you're not throwing away your

1062
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
growing matrix

1063
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,200
every year and

1064
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,760
it also saves on energy

1065
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,639
of course you know i think there is a

1066
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,040
need for monitoring affluence that are

1067
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,759
coming out of groves i mean we have

1068
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:19,838
really no idea about the

1069
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:23,040
uh concentration of certain uh chemicals

1070
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:25,519
that are widely used within these uh

1071
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,719
large-scale grows

1072
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,639
of course professor vasweti has already

1073
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,279
talked to us about

1074
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,239
volatiles and odor mitigation but i

1075
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,400
think that's becoming way more

1076
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:40,399
standardized and you know as we're going

1077
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,960
down this list is more recent

1078
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,800
innovations one of the things i

1079
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,039
recently learned about is recycling of

1080
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,599
co2 so

1081
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:54,880
there's a company in austin texas i

1082
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,760
can't remember their name of course but

1083
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,920
they came up with this idea of capturing

1084
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,720
co2 from local breweries

1085
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,440
and

1086
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:08,319
compressing it and then making it

1087
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,159
available to cannabis grow facilities

1088
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:15,200
that normally do use co2 and that's

1089
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:18,078
happening now in colorado as well and

1090
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,279
it's just like well what a great simple

1091
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,200
idea

1092
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:26,160
and then for me the most uh interesting

1093
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:29,439
new concept i learned about is called

1094
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,239
cold plasma fertilization

1095
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,000
so

1096
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,719
a plasma

1097
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,280
is like what exists on the surface of

1098
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:39,838
the sun and sometimes it's referred to

1099
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,839
as a fourth state of matter

1100
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:47,039
but it has been shown to be able to

1101
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:50,639
deposit nitrogen locally

1102
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:54,000
just where it's needed uh in a cropping

1103
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,118
system rather than flooding your plants

1104
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,280
with

1105
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,720
excessive amounts of nutrients that

1106
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,280
again end up in the effluent so

1107
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,279
i'm curious if the panel members have

1108
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,720
heard of any

1109
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,599
innovative trends on on the horizon for

1110
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:15,199
this industry and and how it might

1111
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,280
uh help preserve the longevity of indoor

1112
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,838
growing of cannabis

1113
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,319
uh well yeah indoor and maybe even

1114
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,719
outdoor uh well a couple interesting

1115
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:26,318
things just we've heard recently we have

1116
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,159
a hopefully a client we're going to sign

1117
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,079
up this week that

1118
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,920
looking at led lighting they essentially

1119
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,440
did a study right before the pandemic

1120
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,039
hit in brazil where they were actually

1121
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,240
supplementing

1122
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,318
outdoor cultivation with cannabis and

1123
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,239
some other plants using led and saw

1124
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,000
actually increasing yield by

1125
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,598
supplementing the natural ambient light

1126
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,639
with led lighting which i thought was

1127
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,240
pretty cool

1128
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,400
and then there's another company we just

1129
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,559
talked to out of colorado that is

1130
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,039
generating terpenes so again i think i

1131
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,119
mentioned this our belief is this uh and

1132
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,639
especially you folks that believe in the

1133
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,039
entourage effect you're going to hate me

1134
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:04,159
but we we believe this is all going

1135
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,400
towards molecules right and so

1136
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,480
and if you saw dr spellman's talk

1137
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,200
uh yesterday about emergent behavior and

1138
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,838
complexity we need to be smarter about

1139
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,759
deconstructing what molecules do what

1140
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,519
which cannabinoids are valuable for

1141
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,680
which indications right

1142
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,838
and so getting to this this company in

1143
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,639
colorado they're using hop

1144
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,358
uh

1145
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,598
hop sources effluent from breweries

1146
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,039
to generate terpenes which is pretty

1147
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,720
cool right and so that's a cheap way to

1148
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,000
do it much cheaper than indoor grill

1149
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:33,679
operation so

1150
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,440
and then for example i don't know if

1151
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,000
you've heard about the company right now

1152
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,119
that's growing hemp outdoors

1153
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,079
they're

1154
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,318
they're concentrating it down to a cbd

1155
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,599
extract and then they're doing a common

1156
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:49,440
chemical conversion from c cbd to thc

1157
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,280
delta 9 thc

1158
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,280
so they're not even doing this under

1159
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,040
regulations so again it gets the point

1160
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,400
where technology is i believe going to

1161
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,400
drive where this industry goes

1162
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:02,559
i don't have a lot to offer regarding

1163
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,880
like indoor farming but i do want to

1164
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:07,119
speak specifically on the farm waste

1165
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,880
management you know of the cannabis

1166
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,079
production so

1167
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,680
uh

1168
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,760
growing cannabis produce a lot of farms

1169
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:14,960
where you harvest the park that is

1170
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,640
useful

1171
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,159
and then the other part you have to find

1172
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,400
a way to deal with it you know they do

1173
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,480
contain uh some of them do contact dxc

1174
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,160
so it's it's the usual practices you

1175
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,079
just uh send it to a disposal site

1176
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,639
uh but uh you know they're different

1177
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,960
used for different parts of cannabis as

1178
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,838
a crop you know one way to do it is okay

1179
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,639
let's just

1180
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,239
see if we can make dual purpose

1181
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,480
crop you know you can get the txt

1182
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,559
component out and you can also get fiber

1183
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,639
so that's one way to do it now another

1184
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,440
way to do it is that um

1185
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,920
uh uh you can actually use

1186
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,838
cannabis as a crop you know in farm

1187
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,400
waste management uh for uh co2 capture

1188
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,639
the idea is that if you think about the

1189
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,318
prop you know most of that the ones that

1190
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:04,960
are not useful uh are cellulose right so

1191
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:06,880
it's not really a very good you know

1192
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,679
chemical composition for

1193
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,760
uh carbon capturing but one way that you

1194
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:14,318
can deal with it is that now in arizona

1195
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,920
we have a lot of sun okay so you have

1196
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,318
fun ways and then

1197
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,200
one possibility is you can leverage the

1198
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:24,639
solar energy that we have to convert the

1199
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,679
farm way into a biochar the biochar so

1200
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,000
biochar

1201
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,399
charcoal right you basically make all

1202
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,039
the you know a component not bio

1203
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,920
available so not only that you remove

1204
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:39,119
the txt but you also remove the uh

1205
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,838
capture the carbon along the way

1206
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,800
so uh that's the only thing i can offer

1207
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,799
with indoor farming yeah

1208
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,400
yeah i don't have much to offer here

1209
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,640
um either i'll just mention you know

1210
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,200
briefly on on water use in particular i

1211
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,000
mean i think there are certainly

1212
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:55,439
a

1213
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,280
lot of a lot of innovation happening in

1214
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,800
the water space around efficient

1215
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,880
efficient irrigation but i think it

1216
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,960
really points sort of back to an earlier

1217
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,119
topic around the question of sort of

1218
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,240
setting setting standards

1219
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,838
and the absence of of standards around

1220
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:13,439
um you know certainly irrigation

1221
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:15,679
requirements um but also other um other

1222
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,519
other other cultivation practices and

1223
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,358
without a without a benchmark it's sort

1224
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,838
of it's difficult to

1225
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:23,039
um i think create incentives for you

1226
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,920
know implementing the types of

1227
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:29,599
innovative technologies that that are

1228
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,358
that are coming on on online

1229
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,119
yeah um so you know some of the things

1230
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:34,960
that i'm looking around and some of the

1231
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,039
work that we're doing actually uh since

1232
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,199
we are able to completely fingerprint

1233
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,639
every single strain that we come across

1234
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,838
uh we've been toying with the idea of

1235
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,358
using that as a marker right to identify

1236
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:47,679
whether you really have the strain that

1237
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,519
you think you have or also to check your

1238
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,440
clones right if make sure you have the

1239
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,039
right clones before you have to wait

1240
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,800
till they're fully grown

1241
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,800
so using the gas phase emission as a

1242
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,839
fingerprint is an interesting thing the

1243
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,760
other thing that we've been looking at

1244
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,239
that's been pretty novel and very recent

1245
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,160
actually is this odor issue so we have

1246
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,679
identified a thiol molecule that does

1247
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,679
that but it's not just the amount of

1248
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,480
thio it's actually its interaction with

1249
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,318
the monoterpenes uh that leads to odor

1250
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,039
and it's a really interesting

1251
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,960
dynamic that we're trying to study there

1252
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,400
and then lastly you know a lot is going

1253
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,400
toward having kind of a clean

1254
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,920
environment for both your workers as

1255
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,559
well as for the cultivation of your

1256
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,559
plants so in addition to our molecular

1257
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,119
filtration as well as our waterless

1258
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,759
vapor phase capture we're also doing

1259
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,200
closed ionization for electrostatic

1260
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,599
capture and and deactivation of viruses

1261
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,439
and molds and spores in addition to

1262
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,440
capturing a lot of particulate matter

1263
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,838
all the way down to the ultra fine size

1264
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,519
so these nano sized particles

1265
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:48,480
so that combined with charcoal

1266
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,079
filtration and the vapor phase really

1267
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,838
attacks all the different things that

1268
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,400
folks and your plants could be exposed

1269
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,920
to so it's pretty exciting and again all

1270
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,079
this wouldn't have been possible without

1271
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,519
understanding from a molecular level

1272
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,440
what's going on and being emitted from

1273
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,838
these plans it's amazing what you can do

1274
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,480
with just a little bit of data

1275
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,759
great great great comments

1276
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,960
um

1277
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,319
so

1278
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,199
in spite of all of these innovations and

1279
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:15,920
uh

1280
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:18,239
optimistic outlook we still have

1281
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,800
significant challenges ahead and i

1282
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:23,118
didn't list on here but i should have

1283
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,920
number one is the disconnect at the

1284
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,039
federal level you know if we didn't have

1285
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,838
these arbitrary geographic boundaries

1286
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,239
between states i think that would

1287
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:37,199
solve a lot of the issues mainly that

1288
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,318
cannabis could be grown outdoors where

1289
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,000
it's

1290
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:44,480
could be grown at a cheaper cost and

1291
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,519
certainly places like las vegas that

1292
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,639
have a

1293
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,440
horrible

1294
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:52,000
shortage and scarcity of water from the

1295
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,240
colorado river is is not a good place to

1296
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,800
be growing cannabis

1297
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,358
but i just will highlight some of these

1298
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,000
i mean i keep harping on the single-use

1299
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:04,880
plastic waste um

1300
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,199
water scarcity which is going to be an

1301
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,440
increasing issue for

1302
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:14,639
for all of us uh across the globe

1303
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,960
the increasing costs i mean running any

1304
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,719
cannabis operation is incredibly

1305
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,838
expensive

1306
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:24,959
testing costs licensing

1307
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,960
all the waste that's occurring i mean

1308
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,679
all parts of this plant could be

1309
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:33,440
utilized instead of ground up and mixed

1310
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:34,879
with concrete and all to the dump

1311
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,079
obviously

1312
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,720
there hasn't been a detailed study

1313
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,440
addressing the exposure of cannabis

1314
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,759
workers who are inside these facilities

1315
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,159
i know it's been mentioned a little here

1316
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,720
by the panel

1317
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:54,960
of course on the health and medical side

1318
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:56,399
we know so little about dosing and

1319
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,920
how these

1320
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,480
various

1321
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,240
phytoactive chemicals are interacting

1322
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,280
together

1323
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:08,159
and we have a growing industry which is

1324
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,800
the uh production of specific

1325
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:14,399
cannabinoids in vitro

1326
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,039
they're being fermented in yeast and

1327
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,079
i tried to get someone from one of those

1328
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:23,480
companies on the panel because i think

1329
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:26,880
we'll start seeing an impact from that

1330
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:29,039
particularly as this industry matures

1331
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,119
and there's more pharmaceutical

1332
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:34,880
companies that become interested where

1333
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:37,119
they want to have very defined

1334
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,519
amounts of different cannabidizer

1335
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,680
specific cannabinoids it'll be much

1336
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,079
easier to just acquire it from one of

1337
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,838
these companies because you don't have

1338
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,920
to worry about the presence of any

1339
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:52,480
residual cannabinoid

1340
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,680
like currently you can't really say that

1341
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,119
something is thc free if it's made from

1342
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,759
cannabis

1343
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,680
because there's no safe harbor

1344
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,720
quantitative level

1345
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:08,159
so i think it all comes down to and the

1346
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:09,519
final uh go around for our panelists

1347
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,440
who've been great

1348
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:16,318
is you know how sustainable is indoor

1349
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,079
grown cannabis

1350
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,759
well to me it gets down to two things

1351
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,200
direct economic impact and uh

1352
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,599
doing the right thing

1353
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,558
uh for example you know as you guys

1354
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,800
probably heard in december 30th

1355
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,319
we had that terrible fire in boulder my

1356
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,680
daughter goes to school up there i went

1357
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:35,039
to school there

1358
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,799
and

1359
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,480
having that happen and i was born and

1360
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,480
raised in colorado to have that happen

1361
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,800
december 30th and a fire like that is

1362
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,800
just absolutely mind-blowing

1363
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,039
uh that fire was so hot they're having

1364
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,640
to rewire the cables that were buried

1365
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,400
three feet below the ground because it

1366
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,558
got so damn hot

1367
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,160
so when that stuff starts happening and

1368
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,079
i think you guys would agree global

1369
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,838
climate change is going to get addressed

1370
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,599
when people start getting direct

1371
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:01,838
economic impact like their land in

1372
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,760
florida starts going underwater and

1373
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,558
people start doing something about it

1374
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,559
right um and for example like getting

1375
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:12,240
back we've talked to a group out of

1376
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,760
mongolia right that's growing hemp and

1377
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,358
you know it's going back to its roots

1378
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,440
right can you imagine there's probably

1379
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:18,239
not many better places to grow cannabis

1380
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,720
than

1381
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,078
mongolia with economics everything else

1382
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,239
one last thing i want to just really

1383
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,519
quickly add doing the right thing i

1384
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:26,959
think you guys would agree that if

1385
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,838
you're in the cannabis industry for

1386
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,559
example my daughter or my wife's family

1387
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:34,318
are big oil people and you can't tell me

1388
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,119
that there's there's not a difference in

1389
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,558
culture between cannabis and oil

1390
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,240
most people i know having been in

1391
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,920
cannabis as long as i have are

1392
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:43,679
interested in the environment and doing

1393
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,849
the right thing so i think that's

1394
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:46,159
critical

1395
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:49,199
[Music]

1396
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:51,440
i want to speak on

1397
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,598
speaking on it from the perspective of

1398
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,800
urban farming so one of the projects

1399
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,240
that i have done you know at arizona

1400
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,680
state university is to look at the

1401
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,919
location of

1402
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:02,879
uh the cannabis and

1403
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,119
uh

1404
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,720
and hemp farm you know in arizona and

1405
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,800
one of the things that i found is that

1406
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,159
when you're building like a greenhouse

1407
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,318
and of course like the growing

1408
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:15,519
environment in arizona very different

1409
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:18,480
from california so i ended up seeing a

1410
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:20,719
lot of farms back in the farm that are

1411
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,800
located right in the middle of city so

1412
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,399
they actually go right along the highway

1413
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,559
which which is really interesting

1414
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,880
because i know you guys are working on

1415
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:32,319
geospatial analysis too and you have the

1416
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,720
satellite imaging analysis uh we found

1417
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:37,358
out that the best way to pick those out

1418
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:39,279
in arizona is not the farm

1419
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,039
it's the air conditioner on top of the

1420
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,920
building

1421
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,079
so

1422
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,680
uh one thing that i want to do is it's

1423
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,519
quite amusing actually what we found but

1424
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:50,318
one thing that i want to speak on is

1425
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,838
that when we talk about urban farming uh

1426
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:54,159
you talk about green how you talk about

1427
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:57,039
hydroponics but how about

1428
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,639
in urban farming outdoor all right

1429
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,440
they're gonna go back to the biology

1430
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:04,078
okay if you put you know a cannabis

1431
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,440
sativa in the field and in arizona

1432
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,760
climate does it

1433
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,039
actually would it actually would grow if

1434
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,839
not what kind of

1435
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,838
selective breeding do we need uh would

1436
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,318
it actually be a viable

1437
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:18,318
solution let's say i have colleagues in

1438
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,639
the u of a extension that are working on

1439
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:22,480
leafy green of ham right that that can

1440
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,480
be an option for urban farming

1441
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,679
alternatively if that doesn't work then

1442
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,760
we also you know like can use a hem you

1443
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:31,199
know again for vital remediation pull

1444
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,720
some of the pollutant now then you can

1445
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,039
grow out of anxiety

1446
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,519
so you know uh i guess that's one area

1447
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,318
that you know uh uh should you know like

1448
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:39,679
uh

1449
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:42,960
you know i would be very interested in

1450
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:42,960
researching more yeah

1451
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,599
yeah i guess i'll just revisit a point i

1452
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,599
made earlier that i think that the

1453
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,599
sustainability of cannabis industry

1454
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,280
really depends on our ability to create

1455
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,519
viable paths for small-scale outdoor

1456
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,519
growers to

1457
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,119
to to exist and thrive in the in the

1458
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:01,199
legal market

1459
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,200
and they're obviously major

1460
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:05,279
market forces that make you know make

1461
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,598
that path difficult but there are also a

1462
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,519
lot of i think regulatory policy changes

1463
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,599
that can't that could be made

1464
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:14,559
to reduce barriers and just tend to

1465
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,280
support that particular um

1466
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,960
segment of of the sort of the

1467
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,559
cultivation

1468
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,079
um

1469
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,960
you know matrix

1470
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,559
uh

1471
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,159
you know the question of indoor

1472
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,160
you know cannabis and

1473
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,358
whether it's it's sustainable i mean it

1474
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,118
really depends on how you define

1475
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:32,400
sustainability the

1476
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,960
you know when you look at the energy

1477
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,240
intensity you know there have i will say

1478
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,519
there haven't been any great studies

1479
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,719
that that have to my knowledge that have

1480
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:42,480
done uh sort of a fair to

1481
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:43,519
apples-to-apples comparison of indoor

1482
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,240
outdoor

1483
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:50,000
in a california context at least

1484
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,000
but it's hard to

1485
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,760
justify or

1486
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,000
you know

1487
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,240
investing in you know really large scale

1488
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,159
indoor you know cultivation in a place

1489
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:02,959
like california where

1490
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,799
where outdoor cultivation is such a

1491
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,880
an obvious alternative

1492
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,960
given especially the state's goals for

1493
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,800
greenhouse gas gas reduction and that

1494
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,800
may i don't know maybe an unpopular

1495
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,000
sentiment but happy to speak with you

1496
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,920
all after about about that topic too

1497
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,280
yeah um you know all interesting things

1498
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,639
and you know they answer this question

1499
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,800
it depends right it depends how you

1500
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,879
define sustainability it depends on how

1501
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,599
you operate these facilities i've

1502
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,200
visited you know probably dozens of

1503
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,359
different kinds of facilities in at

1504
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,679
least three or four different states and

1505
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:36,000
it's amazing how different everyone does

1506
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,279
this hvac systems are completely

1507
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,280
different filtration is different

1508
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,240
humidity is different soils they use is

1509
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,519
different and all those different

1510
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:43,598
variables

1511
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,358
affect energy uses affect relative

1512
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,760
humidity effect temperature effect all

1513
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,279
these other variables that go into this

1514
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,599
and i think i'm right there's not enough

1515
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,760
data available to say how

1516
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,440
you know how do these things compare to

1517
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,799
other activities when it comes to energy

1518
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,280
pesticide use

1519
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,318
and etc i can say from an air pollution

1520
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,680
standpoint if we're talking about

1521
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,279
sustainability

1522
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:04,960
indoor grows are probably easier to

1523
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,519
control because it's an indoor enclosed

1524
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,039
environment you can much easier be able

1525
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,039
to capture any

1526
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,279
molecules that are leaving the facility

1527
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:15,440
uh in an indoor environment whether

1528
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,798
that's better from the other standpoints

1529
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,318
of unsustainable

1530
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:19,599
sustainability that's a different

1531
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,279
question right

1532
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,640
is it easier to control air pollution

1533
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,798
and indoor grow than outdoor grow the

1534
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:26,318
answer that is indoor grows easier now

1535
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:28,318
can you do it in an outdoor grow yes

1536
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,838
absolutely we have lots of different

1537
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:32,000
kinds of technologies allow us to do

1538
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:32,960
that so that's a possibility as well so

1539
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,079
i think when it comes down to

1540
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,240
sustainability it's going to come down

1541
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,440
to energy usage and water usage i think

1542
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:39,118
are the two things that folks should be

1543
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,519
looking at

1544
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:44,480
okay great comments

1545
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:47,759
so we have a few minutes left if anybody

1546
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:52,480
out there has a question for any of our

1547
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,480
panelists this would be a opportune time

1548
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,880
i know i saw folks standing earlier now

1549
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,880
is your time

1550
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:02,159
hi good afternoon

1551
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:04,558
almost afternoon my name's cameron and

1552
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:06,399
i'm a legacy cultivator and i have the

1553
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,960
very first permitted cannabis farm in

1554
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,639
sonoma county we grow

1555
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,000
using permaculture and regenerative

1556
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:16,000
farming practices in the soil and i find

1557
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,838
myself spending more and more time at

1558
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,798
border supervisors meetings especially

1559
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:22,719
over the last five years having to go up

1560
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:24,880
against we have large nimby and not in

1561
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:27,199
my backyard groups and they are really

1562
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,680
driving policies specifically in sonoma

1563
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:31,919
county and we here have people showing

1564
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,679
up to every meeting talking about one

1565
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,838
water usage which thank you for putting

1566
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:38,000
that paper out we quote you all the time

1567
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,838
at board of supervisors meetings but one

1568
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,358
of the big comments is we have people

1569
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:43,440
saying that the terpenes from our

1570
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:45,039
cannabis is making them sick

1571
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,318
and we're allowed to grow ten thousand

1572
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:50,318
square feet and we're outdoors and i

1573
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,318
would like to be able to know what what

1574
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:54,400
does the science say about the terpenes

1575
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:55,599
making neighbors a mile down the road

1576
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,838
sick

1577
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,280
yeah it's a great question so

1578
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,440
and that's something i've looked into

1579
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,359
quite a bit so there have been studies

1580
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,358
looking at worker exposure to mono

1581
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:08,239
terpenes one of the largest exposures to

1582
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:11,039
mono terpenes is pine workers are pine

1583
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:12,558
saw sawing pine in north carolina they

1584
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,400
see parts per million so orders of

1585
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,798
magnitude higher concentrations of alpha

1586
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,880
pine eight hours a day every day for

1587
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,480
decades they followed those workers

1588
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,079
looked at all their public health stuff

1589
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,559
for those workers and found out a single

1590
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,280
toxological effect from being exposed to

1591
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,480
alpha piney at levels that are orders of

1592
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,160
magnitude higher than what you would

1593
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,079
find in the ambient environment at

1594
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:33,199
exposure times that are eight hours a

1595
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,200
day right

1596
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:37,679
and so the terpenes themselves have

1597
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,598
absolutely no toxic effect on humans

1598
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:41,440
we've evolved with these terpenes we

1599
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,440
love the smell of alpha pineal in that

1600
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,760
pine smell we've evolved as human beings

1601
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,679
to like those the issue with the

1602
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,400
terpenes is that when they react in the

1603
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:54,000
atmosphere with a source of combustion

1604
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,079
like car or nox sources in sunlight they

1605
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,679
react and form ozone and they form

1606
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:01,039
particulate matter and those things are

1607
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,798
not good now does it always form that no

1608
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:04,318
in fact it's very complicated which is

1609
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:06,159
why we run these air quality liners and

1610
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:07,920
just to give you a quick example if i

1611
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,239
put a something in downtown denver which

1612
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,838
is high desert and low vocs that could

1613
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:14,000
impact ozone but if i put it in

1614
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,920
carpenteria where there's an ocean of

1615
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,280
biogenic vessels already there adding a

1616
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,280
cannabis essentially has absolutely

1617
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,720
negligible impact you can tell folks in

1618
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,480
california you're being exposed to those

1619
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,798
terpenes every day

1620
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,639
when you peel a orange you get more

1621
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,400
exposure to those vocs than you do

1622
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:29,920
anywhere else

1623
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,400
hope that helps i could talk to you

1624
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,400
after too

1625
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,880
thanks uh cameron actually asked the

1626
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,798
question

1627
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,039
that i was going to ask as well

1628
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:42,000
but i am from massachusetts and i think

1629
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,880
the question was presented at the

1630
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,358
beginning of the panel

1631
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,318
do any states have regulations on on

1632
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:49,598
energy

1633
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:52,480
usage

1634
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:55,200
massachusetts does um they address the

1635
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,838
light power density of a cultivation

1636
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,239
which we have to deal with and abide by

1637
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,318
to some extent so they're trying to

1638
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,239
in some ways pressure people to be more

1639
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:07,119
sustainable at least with respect to

1640
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:09,039
lighting if not hvac

1641
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,920
but part of the problem there is

1642
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:13,838
they've also released outdoor licenses

1643
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,599
our company has a greenhouse as well as

1644
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:17,279
an outdoor grow license

1645
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,079
and the

1646
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,839
microbe thresholds is the problem there

1647
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,839
so the experts that were talking about

1648
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,920
how much energy usage we should be

1649
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:28,400
having did not speak with the experts

1650
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,000
who were talking about microbes so total

1651
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,400
yeast and mold count

1652
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,719
uh you know they they talk about three

1653
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,960
bacteria in particular and then total

1654
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:39,358
yeast and mold is so prohibitive that

1655
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,519
you can't possibly grow outdoors and

1656
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,519
sell that flower without radiating it or

1657
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:45,599
doing something else uh so it's an

1658
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,199
interesting model that i would encourage

1659
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,519
you to check out

1660
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:52,798
come take a visit with me if you'd like

1661
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:54,769
and see what we're dealing with but

1662
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:58,000
that's what i'm saying

1663
00:59:54,769 --> 01:00:01,039
[Music]

1664
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,760
i couldn't hear it but i couldn't answer

1665
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:03,759
there's a question there

1666
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,639
well so uh was there the question mainly

1667
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:09,679
was what the regulations on energy are

1668
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:13,118
right

1669
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:13,118
on energy usage

1670
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,199
real quick from my perspective uh in

1671
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:32,719
colorado the energy usage went way up

1672
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,159
and then you know a lot of these things

1673
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,159
are going out of business et cetera so

1674
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:37,920
there's a big bump and i know xl will

1675
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:39,598
start to give rebates there was also a

1676
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,559
lawsuit and i think it was colorado

1677
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:44,720
springs where somebody sued uh grow up

1678
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,798
because of the smell and i think the the

1679
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:48,879
the plaintiffs the people that got the

1680
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,480
smell ended up losing that lawsuit i

1681
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,039
don't know anybody else yeah i mean

1682
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,960
odors is a real issue people i mean i

1683
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,119
hear from communities all the time about

1684
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,798
the odor issue and i'm telling you we

1685
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,400
don't know a lot about it and a lot how

1686
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:02,239
to mitigate it i mean prior to us

1687
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,200
discovering that molecule everybody if

1688
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:04,959
you talked to most of the individuals

1689
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:07,199
they thought monoterpenes were causing

1690
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,119
the skunky odor there's even companies

1691
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,118
out there who monitor monoterpenes to

1692
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,240
make sure your odor is okay and what

1693
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,920
we've seen is you can have an

1694
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,000
anti-correlation because that's not the

1695
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,680
molecule that's driving the odor

1696
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,039
and so both in the science and

1697
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:21,279
understanding that what's driving the

1698
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,798
odor but also on the subjectivity side

1699
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,720
everybody has a subjective way to do

1700
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,039
odor and these nasal rangers forget

1701
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:29,519
about it there's no precision in that

1702
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:31,838
whatsoever um the only precision you can

1703
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,480
get for odor is using a odor panel which

1704
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:36,000
is a much different thing so there's

1705
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,440
there's a wild west out there when it

1706
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
comes to odor and we're trying to bring

1707
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,079
some data in into the equation

1708
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
i just have a really quick comment uh to

1709
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,000
the uh uh

1710
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,318
uh the gentleman from massachusetts now

1711
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,719
of course growing uh uh

1712
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:52,558
cannabis in in arizona is very different

1713
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,519
from massachusetts i can tell you from

1714
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,640
one of

1715
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:59,920
my projects i actually looked into

1716
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:03,519
ham grove in the yuma county in

1717
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,519
arizona and it's really hot there and i

1718
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:08,480
want to say when it gets hot and you're

1719
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:10,798
growing ham outside it smells really bad

1720
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,719
and it's so bad that the farmer in human

1721
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:14,960
county they have to kind of hide from

1722
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:16,719
their labor because you just you drive

1723
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,240
past the highway you just got this block

1724
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:19,838
of you know smell

1725
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,078
and then you just look at your label oh

1726
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:23,759
my god you know i'm going ham in my farm

1727
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,960
so i can totally agree with what you

1728
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,400
just said now what's interesting with

1729
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,240
that is and we'll let the next person

1730
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,440
question is is when it's hotter it's

1731
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:31,199
probably not because there's more of

1732
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,639
those sulfur molecules it could be that

1733
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,960
there's more dilution and more

1734
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,440
reactivity of the terpenes so the

1735
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,039
terpenes go away revealing the file

1736
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,639
right if you've been in a cannabis

1737
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,240
facility and you go inside most you

1738
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:43,519
probably don't smell that skunky smell

1739
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:44,959
you open a door and you go five feet

1740
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:47,038
away all of a sudden it hits you like a

1741
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,639
wall it's because of the ratio of those

1742
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,000
emissions so it's really a fascinating

1743
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,118
subject

1744
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,639
okay

1745
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:55,519
your question ma'am yes hi um and it's

1746
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:57,440
miss

1747
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,519
[Laughter]

1748
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,920
we don't use ma'am anymore

1749
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:05,759
okay i'm having a really hard time

1750
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:08,318
hearing uh is that better yes it's okay

1751
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,319
that was a little bit of a joke um

1752
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:12,719
uh firstly i'd like my name is sharon

1753
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:16,000
i'd like to thank the panel

1754
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:18,078
uh this has been a very interesting

1755
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,519
topic

1756
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:22,640
because sustainability of our planet

1757
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:25,519
is

1758
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:26,719
really the number one key topic that all

1759
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:28,798
humans

1760
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,399
need to address if we're going to stay

1761
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:35,659
here all right or end up on maura's

1762
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,960
i would like to address the um

1763
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:39,920
[Music]

1764
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:43,039
the aromatic principles

1765
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,680
that the last gentleman had

1766
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:48,160
brought up with regard to odor and odor

1767
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:50,078
abatement

1768
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:50,659
the

1769
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,119
terpene

1770
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:56,399
[Music]

1771
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:59,358
the the terpenes when they are isolated

1772
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,599
or alone and you smell them they're not

1773
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:04,798
really that exceptional

1774
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:07,519
so little which is the predominant

1775
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:09,679
terpene and lavender

1776
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:13,119
you extract that and it doesn't smell

1777
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:15,038
anything like lavender lavender has over

1778
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,318
625

1779
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,319
plus

1780
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:20,880
metabolites in it

1781
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:21,920
and that's what makes that aromatic

1782
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,000
blend

1783
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:28,880
so cannabis is related it's as an herb

1784
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,039
has its odor profile there are two

1785
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,240
classes of chemicals you did mention the

1786
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:36,000
thiols the mercaptans and the pyrazines

1787
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:37,519
there's not much that's mentioned about

1788
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,480
the pyrazines

1789
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:41,199
and

1790
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,159
that is something that um

1791
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:43,679
um

1792
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:46,480
is quite

1793
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:49,838
problematic to a lot of humans

1794
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,199
that causes a headache and causes fear

1795
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:52,880
excuse me ma'am

1796
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,399
we're actually going over on time so do

1797
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,720
you have a question

1798
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,079
my question is actually to address that

1799
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,879
in terms of the odor abatement

1800
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,480
and

1801
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,920
what you found to be significant

1802
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,400
to capture

1803
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,318
the byproducts after they're emitted

1804
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,480
into the air

1805
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:14,960
right so we

1806
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,519
rely a lot on molecular filtration for

1807
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,519
that so we are able to analyze the gas

1808
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:22,960
molecules that come off the plant and

1809
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:25,280
identify mostly thials a group of files

1810
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,280
and other sulfur containing compounds we

1811
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,240
then are able to synthesize or buy a

1812
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,440
standard of that specific molecule and

1813
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:33,598
then

1814
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,039
engineer our controls to capture that so

1815
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,680
we have a real good efficiency of

1816
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,480
capturing these sulfur molecules

1817
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:40,159
you know

1818
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,400
the problem with the odor is that

1819
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:43,838
nobody's going to give us a per billion

1820
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,440
order detection threshold for any of

1821
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:47,358
these sulfur compounds there isn't one

1822
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,960
that exists and so currently we're

1823
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:51,038
trying to engineer to capture every

1824
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,039
single sulfur compound so if it has a

1825
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,000
sulfur compound we're able to capture it

1826
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,839
and make sure it doesn't leave the

1827
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,679
facility and that includes all the

1828
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:59,358
sulfur compounds even the ones that may

1829
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:00,239
have tagged now i don't know about the

1830
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:01,759
piers

1831
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:03,199
molecule i'll have to go back and check

1832
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,960
to see if that's actually emitted by

1833
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:07,358
that i don't remember seeing that on the

1834
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,240
list but i can check on that

1835
01:06:07,358 --> 01:06:12,798
okay thank you so we are actually out of

1836
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:15,199
time in fact we've gone over our time

1837
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:17,358
allotment if you have other questions

1838
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:20,078
you could come up here but

1839
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:23,579
