1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,470
first of all I'd like to thank medicinal

2
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:10,000
genomics and cartage in organizing

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,089
probably one of the best cannabis

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,839
meetings that I have ever attended was

5
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:18,670
equally impressive last year as well

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,679
poverty laboratories is an ISO 17025

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,449
accredited laboratory serving the

8
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:24,848
medical cannabis space for the state of

9
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,439
Massachusetts so with that we work with

10
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:28,629
dispensaries we work with patients

11
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,588
caregivers researchers and so a lot of

12
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,259
the things that I'm going to talk about

13
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:34,030
today are actual things that we see day

14
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,189
to day and I'm trying to bring awareness

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,980
to contaminants because people who are

16
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:40,448
sourcing their material from unknown

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,148
vendors are bringing it to us for

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:45,780
testing and what we see is is in general

19
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,429
pretty horrific when we think about

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,829
contaminants I think about mother nature

21
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:52,750
versus human nature sure the plant might

22
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:55,090
have some components that might be

23
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,250
considered contaminants but really what

24
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,379
I'm most concerned about things that we

25
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,259
as humans introduce we tend to screw

26
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:03,820
things up when we touch things and

27
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,378
cannabis is no different so as far as

28
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,510
contaminants we need to look at how do

29
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,910
we cultivate to the plant how do we

30
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,440
process the plant oftentimes we're

31
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:14,409
introducing contaminants during that

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,500
process process we as a lot think it's

33
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:19,209
very important for producers to look at

34
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,239
a hazard analysis and critical control

35
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:23,889
point plan for any processing facility

36
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,899
and then how do we measure and report

37
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,269
contaminants and how do we regulate

38
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,790
there's people here from all across the

39
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:32,649
world and so a lot of my numbers that

40
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,870
are measure or basically state to state

41
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,090
differences but I'm sure if you expand

42
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,520
that to a global scale you'll just

43
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,620
expand those challenges if you look at

44
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,479
the different contaminants that are

45
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,090
required for testing by various states

46
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,800
you can see that there is no real

47
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,359
synchronicity between the different

48
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,030
states as far as what testing is

49
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,829
required it gets even more challenging

50
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,960
if you start looking yes they may test

51
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:57,399
for pesticides in these multiple states

52
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,049
but when you start looking at the limits

53
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,820
that you have to test for appropriate

54
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,579
limits of contamination it becomes very

55
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:05,769
challenging in our lab we use a variety

56
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:08,199
of analytical techniques to address all

57
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:09,699
the different phytochemical constituents

58
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,949
as well as contaminants I'm just going

59
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,889
to talk about a few focusing on the

60
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:17,378
contaminants that we use and look for in

61
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:18,309
our lab but before I do that I want to

62
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:20,590
talk a little bit

63
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,270
about units one of the one of my

64
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,520
favorite quotes through you get somebody

65
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,880
calling the lab and says do you guys do

66
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,790
the ppm test well I say well yes we do

67
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,259
and we also provide the ppb test but

68
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:33,489
it's really challenging sometimes when

69
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:35,018
people who don't have a science

70
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:37,150
background to understand what is the

71
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:38,980
difference between weight percent ppm

72
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,340
and ppb so when we're talking about

73
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:44,500
residual solvents we might be talking in

74
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,269
terms of parts per million but for heavy

75
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,360
metals we might be focused more on parts

76
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:51,730
per billion and then it gets even more

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,730
complicated a lot of regulators will

78
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,919
choose to use exposure limits and the

79
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:58,298
regulations

80
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,879
basically saying how much contaminant

81
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:03,010
can there be per kilogram of body weight

82
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,449
per week well in order for me as a

83
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,789
testing lab to understand what that

84
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:09,280
means from a pass/fail on a contaminant

85
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:10,329
level I have to know how much the person

86
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,060
weighs and how much they're gonna

87
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,739
consume each day or each week but a lot

88
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,680
of regulators don't understand all that

89
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:19,509
extra verbiage there and so they will

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,180
truncate it and just say well it makes

91
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:25,979
for CAG as ppm micrograms per kilogram

92
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:29,189
is ppb so it ends up in the regs being

93
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,569
numbers that are just extremely low and

94
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:33,459
inappropriate and then what we see

95
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:35,289
happening is when another state is

96
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,420
coming online they look at another state

97
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:39,548
they'll grab those regulations and so we

98
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,219
see these mistakes getting propagated

99
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,959
from one mistake to the next in the mean

100
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:45,669
time the first date corrects it but then

101
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,379
the second state never learned so it

102
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:50,018
leads to some really significant

103
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:52,359
challenges we also have a saying in our

104
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:55,329
lab that says letters and numbers mean

105
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:58,090
something I'm a chemist and so if you

106
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:01,299
look at these units here what this

107
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,539
actually means is that every kilogram of

108
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:07,719
soil can contain no more than four

109
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:09,548
hundred thousand kilograms of lead we

110
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:11,500
assured them that they meant a little m

111
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,810
there it took some time to convince them

112
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,949
that little m and Bigham did not mean

113
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,069
the same thing but these are some of the

114
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:19,599
challenges that we we address so I'm

115
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:21,509
going to talk primarily about pesticides

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,590
plant growth regulators heavy metals

117
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:25,240
microbiological contaminants and process

118
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:27,098
impurities when we think about

119
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,650
contaminants we have to consider the

120
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:31,538
route of administration because what is

121
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:31,870
of concern is going to be very dependent

122
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,550
on how

123
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,939
that product is going to be administered

124
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,040
whether orally sublingually etc you also

125
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:40,719
need to consider the matrix you know if

126
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,480
it's an edible product if it's an a

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,720
topical product is it in the acid form

128
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,160
THC a versus THC there's there can be

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,490
some different considerations that need

130
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,040
to be taken into account if you look at

131
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,780
pesticide that's probably one of the

132
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,939
worst ones and and Ryan talked a lot

133
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:59,919
about that with some really good data

134
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:02,800
and you see that from state to state

135
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,600
there's very significant differences in

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,790
terms of what the pesticides they can

137
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,700
use what the pesticides need to be

138
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,350
tested for what has what levels are

139
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,449
acceptable in the pesticide you can see

140
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,360
that just in a couple states you can see

141
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:18,250
a huge variance Nevada some of the

142
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,590
pesticides are from ten to ten thousand

143
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,420
parts per billion Massachusetts we

144
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:24,279
hardly have to test any pesticides and

145
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,050
these are the prohibited pesticides that

146
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,759
we're testing for but we have to test

147
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,470
them down to ten parts per billion which

148
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,599
makes it very challenging from an

149
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,520
analytical standpoint which needs I mean

150
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,830
need more expensive instrumentation

151
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:40,240
which ultimately that price goes up and

152
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:42,129
gets passed on to the consumer just as

153
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,470
an example in California there was a

154
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:46,600
report that they they saw pesticides in

155
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,990
about greater than 84 percent of their

156
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,280
samples so it is a real concern for us

157
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,889
if you look at some of the different

158
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,629
limits of acceptability by state you can

159
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,300
see that let's just look at Seif

160
00:05:55,629 --> 00:06:00,490
Lutheran in Nevada the acceptable

161
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,910
contamination is four thousand parts per

162
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,819
billion

163
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,700
Oregon 1000 parts per billion and in

164
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:09,069
Massachusetts ten parts per billion so

165
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,420
which is the right answer we don't know

166
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,699
that and part of the challenges for

167
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,980
regulators is that there isn't a lot of

168
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:16,689
toxicological data on these pesticide

169
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,560
when it comes to inhalation in the first

170
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:22,149
place but inflation versus combustion so

171
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,490
it makes it very difficult for them to

172
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:26,439
pick regulations but when we're looking

173
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,150
for pesticides we're using a triple quad

174
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,810
mass spec so we're looking at multiple

175
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:33,279
transitions and fragmentation of the

176
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,810
pesticides and that's a way that we can

177
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,729
confirm that what we're actually seeing

178
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,560
is a pesticide and not an interference

179
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,480
this is an example of a flower sample

180
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,290
that we saw some contamination of my

181
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,520
club you know

182
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,069
butanol

183
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,829
there was significant concentration

184
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:53,800
there but after extraction that

185
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:55,628
concentration of pesticide went up to

186
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,879
over 5 ppm and that's a pretty

187
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:59,740
significant concentration but the

188
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,449
pesticides behave very similar to the

189
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,250
cannabinoids so if you're doing a

190
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,199
process that is going to concentrate and

191
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,699
enrich the cannabinoids you're also

192
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,520
going to be concentrating and enriching

193
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,139
the the pesticides as well that had a

194
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,060
serious impact for us on our extraction

195
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,098
equipment because after this extraction

196
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,348
we now have a contaminated piece of

197
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:19,120
equipment it took us several weeks to

198
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:21,129
clean that piece of equipment to get

199
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,288
that contamination out and after each

200
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,519
cleaning we did a cleaning validation

201
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:27,459
only to find out that we weren't

202
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,288
successful so we cleaned it again did

203
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:31,269
cleaning validation again so cleaning

204
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:32,829
validation is something that we're

205
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:35,079
trying to get across to the industry as

206
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:37,269
a very important tool that can be used

207
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,930
to ensure that you're not passing on

208
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:42,908
contamination through your processes

209
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:45,280
heavy metal toxicity cannabis is well

210
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:46,779
known to bioaccumulate the toxic heavy

211
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,448
metals from the soil and other

212
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:53,218
environmental sources most of the

213
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:56,319
toxicity data is relative to ingestion

214
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:58,089
rather than inhalation but we do know

215
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,360
that you can get inhalation through the

216
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:03,848
mainstream smoke from either smoking or

217
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,500
vaping cannabis products there's more

218
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:08,740
research needed to understand the

219
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,199
implications of what that means so that

220
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:15,009
the regulators have an idea of what can

221
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,680
they set assay is a safe level typical

222
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,598
sources for heavy metals include water

223
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,550
growing medium nutrients processing

224
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,769
equipment and hardware probably one of

225
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,020
the most common that we see is is from

226
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,788
the nutrients a lot of people say

227
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,620
they're using organic nutrients

228
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:32,259
therefore it should be free of heavy

229
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,620
metals but organic nutrients also can

230
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:38,288
frequently have heavy metal contaminants

231
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,060
these are just some limits from some

232
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:41,649
various states most states just referred

233
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,559
to the four heaviest mercury cadmium

234
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:45,909
arsenic and lead they are naturally

235
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,289
occurring elements so it's very

236
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:49,870
important to be able to distinguish

237
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:52,360
between ambient concentrations of these

238
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,698
metals as well as contamination levels

239
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,230
and you can see just that there's a huge

240
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:59,588
just like in the pesticides you see a

241
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,230
huge variance in what is an acceptable

242
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,899
level of contamination again whose

243
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,119
limits are most appropriate we just

244
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,369
don't know that yet and in terms of

245
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:11,850
testing in Massachusetts we have to test

246
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:14,199
every batch is that really necessary

247
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,879
once you have your your processes

248
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:17,889
established should you be required to

249
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,989
test every single batch or should you do

250
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,119
periodic testing after you've tested

251
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:23,859
your your water source your nutrients

252
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:25,899
your soils once you've confirmed that

253
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:27,369
what you're using is free from

254
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,168
contaminants should you have to be

255
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:32,168
continually testing that those are those

256
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:34,958
are questions that need answering we use

257
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:37,178
in Dec inductively coupled mass plasma

258
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,219
spectroscopy spectrometry for

259
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:41,230
measurement of heavy metals basically

260
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,509
where the samples whether it's a gummy

261
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,909
bear or brownie or flour is digested

262
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,649
with microwave assists in a concentrated

263
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:49,778
nitric acid and then it's basically

264
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:53,168
infused into a plasma source where it's

265
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:54,698
ionized and that we measure the mass one

266
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:56,558
of the things we talked to a lot of our

267
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:58,539
clients about is when you have a product

268
00:09:56,558 --> 00:10:01,358
maybe you're using nutrients that have

269
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:03,519
heavy metals in it you can see that the

270
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:04,839
first sample the raw plant material

271
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,610
would fail the massachusett

272
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,129
specifications for concentration of

273
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,369
heavy metals extraction techniques can

274
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:14,259
often be used to remediate that that

275
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:16,298
contamination so a lot of these metals

276
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:18,068
are not soluble in typical extraction

277
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:19,989
solvents and by extracting the

278
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:22,149
cannabinoids out of there unlike the

279
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:24,369
pesticides in the pesticide you're going

280
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,048
to concentrate the pesticides the heavy

281
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:27,699
metals are typically left behind and so

282
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:30,548
it's a way of remediating heavy metal

283
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:32,798
contamination a couple other sources

284
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:34,360
that people don't think about and these

285
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,999
are really critical as you're processing

286
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,879
equipment this is a real example where

287
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:43,329
we actually saw shards of metal that

288
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,369
were probably two to four millimeters in

289
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:47,138
an extract and when we tested these four

290
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:49,288
heavy metal we saw iron chromium and

291
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:51,610
nickel basically stainless steel

292
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:53,350
probably whoever made this equipment had

293
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,649
it turned in some machine shop and they

294
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,928
didn't do a good job of fleshing out the

295
00:10:55,649 --> 00:11:02,769
residual particulate matter and it ended

296
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:05,038
up in people's products another thing

297
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:07,209
that is a concern is these vape pens

298
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:10,350
where do most of these vape pens get

299
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:12,099
made almost all of them in China

300
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,879
hopefully there will be some US

301
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,460
manufacturers

302
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,350
but because of that these pens can look

303
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,480
identical from one vendor to the next

304
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,950
and you don't know what's inside we've

305
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,289
worked with some people in the past to

306
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,850
do some studies on the heating elements

307
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:26,919
and so what we actually have done is

308
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,440
hook up a smoking machine to these and

309
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,240
actually draw off the vapor we collect

310
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,070
that vapor on basically a cigarette

311
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,710
filter and analyze that for the heavy

312
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,570
metals and what we have seen is aluminum

313
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,759
copper nickel chromium these are all

314
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,570
elements that are frequently part of the

315
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:45,759
coil for these vape pens we do see that

316
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,170
some people are now moving to ceramic

317
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,539
coils which might be a much safer

318
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:51,849
alternative these are just some of these

319
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:53,379
there's actually the cigarette type

320
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,220
filter that we've used to collect the

321
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:59,139
heavy metals on residual solvents is

322
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,820
another one you know everybody's doing

323
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:03,220
some kind of extraction especially when

324
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,890
you start talking about preparation of

325
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,050
therapeutics for children you know

326
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,470
geriatrics you know just your average

327
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:13,000
person who wants a capsule or a tincture

328
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,070
you typically have to extract the

329
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,809
cannabinoid from the flower material it

330
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,900
makes it a lot easier to reproducibly

331
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:22,179
dose and so some kind of extraction is

332
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:24,399
typically used there's different

333
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:26,529
classifications for solvents which ones

334
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,679
are appropriate for use

335
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,870
certainly we try and stick to solvents

336
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,329
like ethanol that's probably our

337
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,460
favorite just because of the low

338
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,470
toxicity of it and because it's pretty

339
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,340
ubiquitous in our everyday life anyways

340
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,399
our hydrocarbon extractions acceptable

341
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,840
well to me that depends on what kind of

342
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,419
hydrocarbon you're using most states

343
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:53,350
recommend that you use 99% pure

344
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:56,589
butane to do an extraction well my

345
00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:00,670
concern is what's in that 1% if you're

346
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:03,280
using 99.99% pure butane what's in that

347
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:05,529
point zero zero one percent until we

348
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,169
start looking at that contaminant in

349
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:10,179
that material I'm on the fence about

350
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:12,490
whether or not butane hydrocarbon

351
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:14,379
extractions are appropriate because I

352
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,389
don't know what that impurity is and I

353
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,590
can pretty much guarantee you that that

354
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,199
impurity is going to end up in your

355
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:24,149
product and then what limits are

356
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,650
appropriate in the last 3-4 months

357
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:30,250
Massachusetts went from a limit of

358
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:33,159
ppm for butane 212 over that same period

359
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:39,129
of time Colorado went for the same you

360
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:43,539
tane limits from 800 ppm to 5000 so 0.5

361
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:45,340
5000 ppm is 0.5% do you want to be

362
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:47,469
vaping something that's point five

363
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,970
percent butane do you want your family

364
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,519
members vaping something that's that

365
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,440
high no I don't think so but so what

366
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,600
limits are most appropriate I think that

367
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,520
one of the things Massachusetts has done

368
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,680
and it's very frustrating for us as an

369
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,370
analytical lab but Massachusetts chosen

370
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:06,159
very stringent guidelines with a thought

371
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,320
that as we have more data we can loosen

372
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,179
those up a little bit and I think that

373
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,460
is the right approach but hopefully

374
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:14,859
they'll move forward and loosen them up

375
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,120
some more the other thing that we talked

376
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,430
with a lot of our clients about is

377
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,810
cleaning solvents we very frequently

378
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:21,699
talked to people who are doing ice water

379
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:23,469
hash and we're seeing residual solvents

380
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,170
they said that's impossible I don't use

381
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,519
any solvents in my process I said well

382
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:29,319
what about when you're done what do you

383
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,990
do I said well we clean our equipment

384
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,879
with isopropanol I'm like well how do

385
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,100
you know that that isopropanol that

386
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:39,519
you're using is not the same isopropanol

387
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,320
I'm showing in your bubble hash which it

388
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,139
turns out after some studies we show

389
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,940
that these solvents that you use for

390
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:47,590
cleaning end up in your product if

391
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,690
you're not doing cleaning validation

392
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,980
cleaning validation is a whole field

393
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,140
unto itself

394
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,940
in the pharmaceutical industry everybody

395
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:57,429
knows what that is it's just part of the

396
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,990
the process of production it's something

397
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:01,989
that people need to be more aware of in

398
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,029
the cannabis processing industry but

399
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,950
here's just another slide just showing

400
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,049
some of the variability from state to

401
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,879
state we do see that there's a little

402
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:11,559
bit more synchronicity starting to form

403
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,019
at the residual solvents as they kind of

404
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:16,329
have chosen to standardize for the most

405
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:20,079
part on USP residual solvent standards

406
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,990
the USP does not have any standards for

407
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,820
butane or propane but for the other ones

408
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,330
they seem to be kind of settling in on

409
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,950
on some pretty similar values but this

410
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,150
is just an example that we saw this was

411
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:36,910
brought in from a client that had a

412
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:40,389
butane level of about 1300 ppm butane

413
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:42,519
and a lot of these people when you have

414
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:44,980
extracts that don't have butane there

415
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,299
they don't taste the same they they're

416
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,320
missing that taste I said well that's

417
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:53,289
the contaminant you're missing so and

418
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,640
then microbiological contaminants you

419
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,959
know I think a lot of the concern is

420
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,230
with the contaminants that we're

421
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,120
introducing and oftentimes the the

422
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,159
actual production processes will kill

423
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,990
MicroBot microbial contaminants so if

424
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,299
you're doing an ethanol extraction if

425
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,529
you're doing a decarboxylation

426
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:11,289
oftentimes these processes themselves

427
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:13,389
will destroy some microbiological

428
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:14,919
contaminants but well you also have to

429
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,840
be concerned about if you're making a

430
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:18,370
product that doesn't have heating

431
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,410
involved with it like you're making a

432
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,450
tincture that's based on a cannabinoid

433
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:24,669
acid where you don't want to heat it too

434
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,470
much you might have to think about some

435
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:29,199
other potential for microbiological

436
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,330
contaminants because that heating may

437
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,720
not kill some of you might be relying on

438
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:36,340
that heating step to kill microbial

439
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:41,139
contamination that is not going to be

440
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:42,790
there and so these really have to be

441
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:45,750
taken into account when states are

442
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:47,740
making regulations on the different

443
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,669
levels of contamination

444
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,870
there's many different ways to measure

445
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:55,089
microbiological contaminants certainly

446
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:59,200
the the plating techniques are probably

447
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:00,879
the most common we use a combination of

448
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,230
all of these actually where we're using

449
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,289
it's called the most probable number

450
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,420
enumeration but now we're seeing more

451
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:08,769
and more DNA based techniques and for

452
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,259
good reason and I'll explain in a minute

453
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:14,019
but DNA based techniques that can be

454
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:17,109
more specific to the the actual DNA of

455
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:19,240
the organism of interest most states

456
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:22,209
currently are using the American herbal

457
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,950
pharmacopoeia guidelines as a basis some

458
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:27,840
states have also added in mica toxin

459
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:31,029
testing but I put here the the typical

460
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,639
levels for contamination for flower and

461
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:35,740
one of the challenges of that when you

462
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,540
have people that are cultivating with

463
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,359
pesticides we're asking them not to use

464
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:42,369
pesticides and we need to give them

465
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,649
tools to use without pesticides so

466
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:46,179
there's beneficial insects but there's

467
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,310
also beneficial bacteria

468
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,259
there's beneficial fungi so these are

469
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,429
beneficial microbials that they can use

470
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:53,710
so that they don't have to

471
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,330
and pesticide so heavy the problem with

472
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,210
those recommendations that if they start

473
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:59,919
to use those beneficial microbes they're

474
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,259
going to start failing these because

475
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,170
these are not specific to the organism

476
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:07,690
but rather to a class and so as you

477
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:10,120
start to look at DNA based techniques

478
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:13,390
that have the specificity it becomes

479
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:16,059
much more appropriate a couple important

480
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,920
considerations certainly you have to

481
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:20,980
communicate with a state and local

482
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,360
regulatory agencies ISO accreditation

483
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,670
bodies have an enormous amount of

484
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,439
information our instrument vendors have

485
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,450
been phenomenal in terms of getting us

486
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,509
guidance and helping us with developing

487
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:34,180
methods they're currently about 10 or 11

488
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:36,099
different organizations that are trying

489
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:39,310
to establish testing methodologies for

490
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:40,750
the cannabis industry but the people who

491
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:42,039
are in the cannabis industry for the

492
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,299
most part are pretty tight-lipped they

493
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,369
don't want to share their methods and

494
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:46,690
that's not the scientific way the

495
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:48,789
scientific way you have to communicate

496
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,559
you have to validate in other labs you

497
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:52,599
have to share methodologies and work

498
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,250
together and so they still see that

499
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,319
there's more need for that communication

500
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,240
to develop those standardized testing

501
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,490
methodologies and then proficiency

502
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,740
testing proficiency testing is one of my

503
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,329
biggest challenges because we can't take

504
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,789
a sample of cannabis and send it to

505
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:07,929
every lab in the u.s. because of

506
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,409
crossing state lines

507
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:15,910
so it's very challenging to do a

508
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:19,060
proficiency testing program so for many

509
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:21,250
contaminants toxicity is cumulative the

510
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,809
cultivation product processing

511
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,549
activities need to consider the

512
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:26,740
different sources to minimize those

513
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:28,919
certainly a lot more work needs to be

514
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,079
done and understand the toxicity

515
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,190
especially when it comes to inhalation

516
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,899
combustion and inhalation those are

517
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,840
areas that really need more study and

518
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,690
regulatory consists considerations are

519
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,730
becoming more important they're always

520
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,380
evolving some of the numbers in my slide

521
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,569
may be off because literally the states

522
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,160
are revving them constantly and then

523
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:49,720
standardized methods and proficiency

524
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,940
testing are really going to help the

525
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,620
labs generate reliable data but

526
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,140
ultimately is that part of that whole

527
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:57,789
process we need to communicate better I

528
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,740
need to thank my colleagues at proverty

529
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:01,839
laboratories as well as a number of the

530
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,670
vendors who we've worked with over the

531
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,869
past three or four years who live just

532
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,850
as I said been very

533
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:08,679
a part of and helpful in our process is

534
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:11,339
getting up and running and with that I'd

535
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,340
like to thank you

536
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,159
you
