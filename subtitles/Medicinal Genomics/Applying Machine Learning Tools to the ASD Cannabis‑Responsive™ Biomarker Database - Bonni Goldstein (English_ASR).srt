1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,440
all right I think I'm going to get

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,440
started so as you all know I work with a

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,759
lot of uh children with epilepsy and

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,399
autism and is often the case with uh

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,160
Canabis medicine we see all these

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,879
significant improvements but yet these

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,920
improvements are difficult to measure

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,479
objectively and so uh you may ask me

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,039
well if a child's doing well and the

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,719
parents are happy and the school is

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,160
Happy why do we need need objective

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,878
measurements and uh I think part of it

13
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,599
goes to what Dr meckler was just talking

14
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:40,079
about which isep the ongoing skepticism

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,280
within the medical

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,840
community uh they uh uh are still

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,879
somewhat resistant uh to patients using

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,120
cannabis especially children still

19
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,640
considered very controversial uh I don't

20
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,238
think so but many others do but the

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,039
other thing too is wouldn't it be nice

22
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:00,078
if somebody was spending $1,000 a month

23
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,558
and seeing great benefits in their child

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,439
that was covered by insurance and we all

25
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,798
know and I definitely see this that

26
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,879
insurance

27
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,520
companies um are are are not interested

28
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,039
in paying for this but I think we're

29
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,039
saving the insurance companies a huge

30
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,759
amount of money because these kids have

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,159
much uh lowered Health Care utilization

32
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,280
needs I definitely see it in my

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,079
pediatric epilepsy practice where these

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,920
children are not ending up in the ICU

35
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,679
every other month with status uh so it

36
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,320
would be nice if their insurance

37
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,479
companies would pay for some of these uh

38
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:36,398
medications for them um so I'm going to

39
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:39,759
talk about my research in uh using uh

40
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,519
phaco metabolomics which and measuring

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,239
salivary

42
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:48,319
biomarkers uh in uh to measure the

43
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,560
impact of medical cannabis in uh

44
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,078
children so I think we all know about

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,040
autism spectrum disorder as being this

46
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:57,319
heterogeneous condition with increasing

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,000
prevalence right now the CDC says one in

48
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:03,000
36 children

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,879
uh this is 241 per higher than what was

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,118
reported 24 years ago there's clear-cut

51
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,919
evidence of inflammation in both the gut

52
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:12,479
and brain and currently there's only two

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,958
FDA approved medications both anticho

54
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,759
discs which have a very serious short

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,479
and long-term side effects I have an

56
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:22,719
11-year-old patient in my practice who

57
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:25,199
gained 40 pounds in about 3 months on an

58
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,039
anticho and so it didn't help his

59
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,280
aggression it just made him bigger and

60
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,159
stronger uh and that's not really

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,000
desirable

62
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,318
um but if you're um looking at really

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,158
what what are the issues with autism we

64
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:42,199
talk about the three uh core symptoms um

65
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:44,039
that are listed here at the bottom and

66
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,958
no Pharmaceuticals address these so

67
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,158
communication difficulty and I say in

68
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,000
some because some people with Autism

69
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:52,878
communicate just fine uh impaired

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,039
reciprocal social interaction and

71
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,280
restricted repetitive and stereotype

72
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,479
behaviors of pattern we know boys are

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,800
more affected than girls uh we also know

74
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,359
some of the these patients have a very

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,640
significant above average intelligence

76
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,640
um but some have intellectual

77
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,439
disabilities uh there's numerous uh

78
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,359
clinical trials yesterday I I talked

79
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,878
about this in the medical practicum this

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,440
uh one particular uh review looked at 13

81
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,560
studies and uh what they found it's kind

82
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,439
of hard for me to see this uh four

83
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,598
observational studies that showed that

84
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,280
70 to 93 uh percent of participants had

85
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:30,518
Improvement it's a very high number

86
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,039
especially in this refractory uh

87
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,599
condition that's somewhat it really

88
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,158
doesn't have very many options uh two

89
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:39,318
retrospective reviews showed 61%

90
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:42,239
Improvement rates and behavior

91
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:45,000
67% improvements in those core symptoms

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,759
which Pharmaceuticals do not uh treat

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,878
three studies show there's uh they're

94
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,759
able to decrease uh dosing or

95
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,798
discontinue other medications and all

96
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:56,318
studies demonstrated a very acceptable

97
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,840
safety and tolerability and I don't have

98
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,438
a slide on this I talked about it I

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,239
think yesterday uh it appears that

100
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,680
children with autism have an endoc

101
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,719
canabo deficiency there's two studies

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,920
one from Israel and one from uh Stanford

103
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,959
University showing that uh they have

104
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:14,719
lower levels of anandamide and so

105
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,918
remember what anandamide is involved

106
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,000
with is uh pretty much everything that

107
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,279
we need in ter terms of regulating

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,319
emotional Behavior Uh also uh endoc

109
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,319
canabo are involved in immune function

110
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,560
and uh we know that there's a lot of

111
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:33,680
connection uh in terms of treating this

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,918
underlying likely endoc canabo imbalance

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,319
in these patients so I've treat hundreds

114
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,918
and hundreds of children already with

115
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,800
who have autism some of them have

116
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,038
comorbidity with uh seizures uh but this

117
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,280
is what the parents report and this is

118
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,599
fairly routine it's not every patient

119
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,439
but many of them less anxiety and by the

120
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,039
way anxiety is a number one condition

121
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,240
that uh parents come in for at these

122
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:59,439
kids like they just are so overly

123
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,560
anxious I I can't tell you I've actually

124
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,879
met met with patients like outside my

125
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,560
building cuz they wouldn't come in the

126
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,959
building or go up the

127
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,519
elevator less aggression towards others

128
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,079
and self better sleep less rigidity

129
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,279
improv socialization speech

130
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,240
communication better focus some patients

131
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,399
do have some improvement in the

132
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,199
repetitive behaviors what's interesting

133
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,159
is that you can see patients improve in

134
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,560
certain areas and not in others what I'm

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,720
finding difficult to treat in some of

136
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,720
these kids are some kind of OCD hoarding

137
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,000
behaviors which are really interesting

138
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,400
and I've had to kind of really try try

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,879
other things with those patients uh to

140
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,758
figure it out so the current approach is

141
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,519
trial and error and don't let anybody

142
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:44,080
tell you otherwise uh you start a

143
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:47,959
patient on um either combination CBD THC

144
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:50,120
or CBD dominant product the studies uh

145
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,719
mostly from Israel show that CBD

146
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,280
dominant will treat about 50% of your

147
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,440
patients and then you can start

148
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:59,679
tailoring it down if someone's

149
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:02,120
aggressive or has severe insomnia uh or

150
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,199
severe anxiety I'm I'm always uh

151
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,120
interested in using some THC in the

152
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,840
beginning but anyway the point being

153
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,240
here is that it's a really difficult

154
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,439
process to figure out these kids are all

155
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,038
different um and it's trial and error at

156
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:19,079
best and it's based on Parental feedback

157
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,639
it's time consuming it is incredibly

158
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,959
labor intensive for the clinician and

159
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,079
for the parent I make sure parents keep

160
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,680
notes

161
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,318
because one day can vary from the other

162
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,120
and sometimes you have to just look over

163
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,080
time how many days were better and how

164
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,959
many days weren't better because uh

165
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,198
there's just a lot of variability in the

166
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,318
response so the big question is who

167
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,280
might benefit can we pre-select who

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,800
might benefit and save

169
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:48,719
people uh uh time and energy and

170
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,400
resources also uh can we pre-select

171
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,680
cannabinoids and products and how do we

172
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,239
assess the outcome objectively and so

173
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,400
this brings me to the research I'm doing

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,079
with a company called can formatics and

175
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,198
all of our papers are open uh source so

176
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:04,120
there's three of them online if you just

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,439
Google my name and write put autism

178
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,639
research you'll find the papers so this

179
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,319
technology uses phico metabolomics which

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,960
is basically the systematic

181
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,160
identification and quantification of

182
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:17,038
metabolites in an organism or biologic

183
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,639
sample so we collect U metabolites which

184
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,199
are compounds that make up what we call

185
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,560
the metabolome and this is just these uh

186
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,160
compounds that reflect chemical Pathways

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,879
they allow you to see uh what is

188
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,240
happening in the brain and it looks at

189
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,759
phenotype versus genotype so you can do

190
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,680
the DNA studies but DNA remember just

191
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,080
gives you predictive if the gene isn't

192
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,680
turned on it's not being expressed it

193
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:42,478
may not necessarily help you in

194
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,120
determining uh how you should treat a

195
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,038
patient but when you're looking at the

196
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,360
the metabolites the metabolome it tells

197
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:49,759
you what's going on in that human right

198
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,479
at the moment that you're collecting

199
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,960
that uh

200
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,439
information and this is just the way

201
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,839
that the samples are collected and you

202
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,519
can do pharmacom metabolomic or metabol

203
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,119
testing really on any biof fluid any

204
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,359
tissue uh cultured cells and then what

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,519
we do is we uh collect the samples and

206
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,919
we send it in for nuclear Ms or a mass

207
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:15,318
speec and then uh you look at your Peaks

208
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,478
and you kind of uh scale your raw data

209
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,400
and then you have uh reports that you

210
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:23,478
can generate including heat maps and

211
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,959
also um you can uh put out pathway maps

212
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:27,240
and I'm going to show you examples of

213
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,560
those as we go through this and so this

214
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,599
was the first paper we put out and this

215
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,000
was um uh looking at the metabolites

216
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,759
that we collected and I'll go through

217
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,440
how we did it but really what we're

218
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,439
looking at is metabolites that reflect

219
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,159
the pathways that are involved in

220
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,120
inflammation bioenergetics amino acid

221
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:48,519
metabolism neuronal activity and the

222
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,879
endoc canabo system trying to see and

223
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:56,240
really ultimately just to make it simple

224
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:58,240
before cannabis we collect uh a sample

225
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,959
after their dose we collect a sample and

226
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,519
we see what changed what moved did it

227
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,278
correlate with behavior so we had 15

228
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,120
children with autism these are children

229
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,838
who were all on stable doses of medical

230
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,159
cannabis customized through my Care at

231
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,600
least for one year and we weren't

232
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,439
changing anything so that we could

233
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,120
see uh leave them on those stable doses

234
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,519
for at least 3 months prior to the uh

235
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,000
collection two saliva um samples were

236
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,560
collected and it wasn't a swab they

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,480
actually had to spit into a tube uh we

238
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,439
did it before they got their medical

239
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,480
cannabis dose in the morning and then

240
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,800
anywhere from an hour and a half to 2

241
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,440
hours after they got their medical

242
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:43,479
cannabis dose in the morning and so um

243
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,720
about midm morning and by the way this

244
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,480
was during Co we started before Co so it

245
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,000
got a little bit different during covid

246
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,360
where we just had to be like on the

247
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,120
phone with the family while they were

248
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,720
doing this um and then we did Behavior

249
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,159
surveys and we taught the parents how to

250
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,360
do the behavior surveys and they did the

251
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:01,159
survey at the same time as the first

252
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,600
saliva collection and the second saliva

253
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:05,919
collection and then we had a sample of

254
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,639
nine children typically developing no

255
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:12,879
evidence of any uh neurologic issues uh

256
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,559
no medical cannabis we just uh grabbed a

257
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,838
saliva sample in the morning and they

258
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,078
established our physiologic range which

259
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,160
you can see here so I just want to show

260
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:24,439
you this this was kind of how we set up

261
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:27,039
um how do we know what's um in that

262
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,320
physiologic range so here's um the

263
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,039
patients 1 through nine who are neuro uh

264
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,000
typically developing TD and here's their

265
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,480
average and then we figured out standard

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,440
deviations and what we decided for our

267
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,320
our um study was that greater than or

268
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,720
less than four standard deviations away

269
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,639
from the mean was considered um uh uh

270
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,680
out of the range and significant and was

271
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,639
um actually correlated with symptoms and

272
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,278
what you can see here this is this is

273
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,720
just uh what the uh before cannabis and

274
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,240
after cannabis that was just our

275
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,240
hypothesis of what it would look

276
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,399
like this is the um characteristics of

277
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,719
the patient so I'm just going to show

278
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,320
you here uh we started with age six

279
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,519
because under six is kind of hard to

280
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,360
collect saliva uh we needed one 1 ml of

281
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,399
saliva and so we went up to age 12 we

282
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,600
were trying to minimize the effects of

283
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,958
puberty although we did see some effects

284
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,879
of puberty you can see mostly boys this

285
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:28,239
is how many doses a day that they were

286
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,799
taking so one dose would be in the

287
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,879
morning if it was three doses morning uh

288
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,519
afternoon and evening now I just want to

289
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,240
point out Edibles and tinctures these

290
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,959
kids were all on tinctures nobody was

291
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,839
actually taking a gummy it's just we

292
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:42,159
called it inedible if it the parents

293
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,600
were putting it in food and then you can

294
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:49,078
see each child's cannabis uh regimen and

295
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,720
you can see that there's nothing um

296
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:55,359
consistent it's based on their own uh

297
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,720
response um working very hard with the

298
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,519
family to try to dial in using my rouet

299
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,560
in or rulet out and some of these kids

300
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,839
it took 2 years to find what worked for

301
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,719
them and remember that during the time

302
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,120
that you're taking care of these

303
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,240
patients new canabo are coming out and

304
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,078
then you want to maybe introduce

305
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,759
something new after somebody's um been

306
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,198
on something for a

307
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,198
while now here's the behavioral ratings

308
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:21,278
before cannabis and just to cut to the

309
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:23,519
chase red is severe Behavior Uh the

310
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,799
lighter colors are less severe and we

311
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,240
use three validated scales to assess

312
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,198
this uh the parental ratings of symptoms

313
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,959
before cannabis so so 11 of the children

314
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:35,159
were severe one child was moderate two

315
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,119
children were mild and we actually

316
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,958
missed data on one of the

317
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,240
kids and then this is after so you can

318
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:47,359
see that this improved 11 children were

319
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,480
considered um much improved uh two

320
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,919
children had mixed response so improved

321
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,399
in some areas but not in others and two

322
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,958
children actually had increased

323
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,399
difficulties at Peak and it's quite

324
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,799
possible that they were not happy about

325
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,519
having to give another saliva sample and

326
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,559
got you know again with the rigid

327
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,879
behavior and so on it's everybody's I

328
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,559
always say everybody's allowed to have a

329
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:09,120
bad day so uh these are the behavior

330
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,198
ratings and what you can see here is

331
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,078
under this Improvement these are pretty

332
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:16,399
high numbers here and then no change and

333
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,919
then you see on the end some uh actual

334
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,799
worsening for some of the

335
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:26,240
kids and so we detected 484 known

336
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,240
metabolites in the saliva 65 were

337
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,399
identified as cannabis responsive which

338
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,560
means that we found that they moved

339
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,159
after the Cannabis dose towards the

340
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,559
physiologic range and at least eight uh

341
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:41,278
to um 15 of the in at least eight of the

342
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:44,559
participants 31 of the metabolites were

343
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,439
detected in all the participants and 21

344
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,799
exhibited statistically significant

345
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,480
shifts and I'm not going to go just cuz

346
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,159
TimeWise I don't have that much time

347
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,159
into how we calculated but these are

348
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,439
algorithms they're explained in the

349
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,759
paper but it just gave us a way to

350
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,480
measure the change and kind sort out the

351
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,039
zc

352
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,920
scores and so here and I showed this

353
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:09,639
yesterday I think I can't remember now

354
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:11,919
um uh anical aspartate which is one of

355
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,480
the most abundant neurochemicals in your

356
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:17,439
brain it's the second most abundant

357
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,440
after um glutamate and what we found and

358
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,399
and there's already research that exists

359
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,920
that shows that anical aspartate which

360
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,440
is involved in neuronal function and

361
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:28,078
density and can reflect neuronal

362
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,839
dysfunction um this particular compound

363
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,159
has already been document mented to be

364
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,880
low in some individuals with autism or

365
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,879
elevated in some individuals with autism

366
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,320
and the elevation was Associated more

367
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,720
with high functioning Aspergers type um

368
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,160
uh symptoms um but what you can see here

369
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,959
so these are the patients along the

370
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:51,078
bottom A1 A2 A3 A5 so let's just look at

371
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:54,559
A2 so A2 had very high

372
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:56,359
NAA uh prior to their medical cannabis

373
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,518
and what you see after they take their

374
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,560
Med medical cannabis is it as much lower

375
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,240
and it's towards this is the physiologic

376
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,758
mean here established by the typically

377
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,399
developing groups you can see here

378
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,199
they're all kind of tightly uh clustered

379
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,440
around this average here and then this

380
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:17,120
gray line is the um uh plus two or min-2

381
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,320
standard deviations away from the mean

382
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,759
so what you see though is that look at

383
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,959
A3 there's basically no NAA measurable

384
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,199
and then it comes up towards the mean

385
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,078
when it's um high as you can see in the

386
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,399
older kids they all kind of had high NAA

387
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,399
that all came down towards the

388
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,600
physiologic mean so here's some

389
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,318
objective evidence of the homeostatic

390
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,159
nature of cannabinoids as well as

391
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:43,599
shifting those compounds towards that

392
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,958
physiologic range that was established

393
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,440
by the children who don't have autism so

394
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,039
I was really excited to see this I

395
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
didn't think that we would see such uh

396
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,599
great results and then I showed this

397
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,359
yesterday and if you haven't seen this

398
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,879
this is just three of the older

399
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,800
boys this is uh plotted out go on this

400
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:03,198
side uh here's your mean that goes down

401
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:06,799
from the arrow the minus 2 to plus two

402
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:09,120
in the green column these are all the um

403
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,559
U metabolites listed on the left hand

404
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,318
side and you can see kind of how they're

405
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:17,078
all out of range and then uh after

406
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:20,078
medical cannabis you see this is very

407
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,719
crystal clear that what's happening and

408
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,559
what the parents are reporting what the

409
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,278
parents are reporting is we're seeing

410
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:27,958
this incredible shift of these various

411
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:31,318
metabolites remember they reflect

412
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:33,359
inflammation neuronal function uh they

413
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:35,198
are correcting now it seems to be a

414
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,159
temporary correction cuz if these are

415
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:42,000
kid kids on cannabis uh around the clock

416
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:44,719
or all the time why are they having this

417
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,919
initial and this was 8 hours at minimum

418
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,639
of 8 hours without cannabis so it's a

419
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,240
temporary cor correction so I don't ever

420
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,079
want anybody to think that quote we're

421
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,560
curing patients but I do think what

422
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:58,159
we're doing is giving them a natural

423
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,000
non-toxic option to have a decent

424
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,679
quality of life

425
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,879
and to live in a more physiologic

426
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,279
balanced

427
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,519
State and so what we did was we decided

428
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,119
to see if machine learning could help us

429
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,279
understand more about our findings and

430
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,239
this was a report that we published in

431
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,959
August 23 there was a second report

432
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,160
which I'm not including here where we

433
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,360
looked at just the lipid based um uh

434
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,400
metabolites uh but then we took all this

435
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,599
data and we decided to see what machine

436
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,679
learning could tell us and so we had a

437
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,480
lot of data you see three categories of

438
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,200
children so we had typically developing

439
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,960
children and their saliva metabolites

440
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,798
and then we had the category of children

441
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,519
before they took their cannabis and

442
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,319
those metabolites and then the category

443
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,038
of of the same children but the

444
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:45,839
metabolites after their cannabis and

445
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,798
then we had lots of metabolites to look

446
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,959
at as you can see in the corner down

447
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:53,200
here and then we looked at the

448
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,400
correlation of these metabolites in

449
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,319
these categories of

450
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,600
children uh with just the three of the

451
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,918
main cannaboids the other cannabinoids

452
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,759
that you saw listed on that chart

453
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,520
including thca cbda and CBM we just

454
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,879
didn't have enough data and there

455
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:13,200
weren't enough children on those uh um

456
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,159
canabo to be able to assess it and so

457
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,360
what we did was we created numerical

458
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:21,080
scales for the dosing and you can see

459
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,959
here uh and it was somewhat arbitrary

460
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,759
but we had to create some type of

461
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,759
scaling so that we could uh feed the

462
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,440
data in and what you can see here is the

463
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:34,000
dosing uh each dosing range uh got a

464
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,759
number each behavioral response got a

465
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,640
number and that was what uh uh we gave

466
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,200
um uh along with all the uh metabolite

467
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,440
um data

468
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,519
sets and so I can't include every

469
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,159
finding but um I'm going to highlight

470
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,279
kind of the most exciting findings here

471
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,640
so this is I'm starting kind of

472
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,720
backwards than what's in the paper but

473
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,038
basically we looked at differentially

474
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,679
expressed non cannabinoid plant

475
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:05,480
metabolites and we found seven

476
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,640
phytochemicals including uh flavone uh

477
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,360
Rootin rutin is a type of

478
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:15,520
coratin um vexin which is um

479
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:19,479
apennine uh naringenin zanthin corosolic

480
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:21,759
uh acid and uh cyto sterol and they were

481
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,960
all associated with Shifting the

482
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,440
Cannabis responsive

483
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,120
biomarkers excuse me from large standard

484
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,000
deviations away from the mean towards

485
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:34,639
that physi logic mean so what does that

486
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,519
mean and so all of these compounds are

487
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,280
have some evidence of being uh acetool

488
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,599
and esterase Inhibitors which are

489
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,240
involved in you know memory learning

490
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,480
attention motivation Dr um meckler

491
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,079
mentioned acetool and esterase um and so

492
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,240
what we found though and if you look

493
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:56,199
here um what you can see is this gray

494
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,319
bar is pre so this is your just um you

495
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,360
can see that here so before Medical

496
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:04,639
canab this is chyc acid uh this is where

497
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:08,038
the kids sat with their um uh

498
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,400
metabolites and that for corol acid and

499
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,480
then the second bar is after cannabis

500
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,480
and the third one is in the children who

501
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,599
don't take cannabis so why would it be

502
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,200
there well remember it's a phyto

503
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:21,558
chemical so it's maybe in salad or some

504
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,960
other uh plant material that the child

505
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:26,519
was taking but notice that none of the

506
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,519
others here were found in the typically

507
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,639
developing uh patients um but the point

508
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,679
being that these compounds were

509
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,120
associated with improvements and um we

510
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,640
hypothesized that this um contributes to

511
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,719
the idea of the Entourage effect that

512
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,840
it's not just the canabo it's also these

513
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,038
plant compounds because these were found

514
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:52,879
to um stand out uh in the patterns that

515
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:56,200
were discovered now here this ven

516
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,080
diagram documents the identification of

517
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,679
the autism um cannabis responsive

518
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:04,038
biomarkers that distinguish categories

519
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,360
of the patients and so U machine

520
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:10,278
learning found one particular compound

521
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:13,199
that stood out to be different between

522
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:15,119
the diagnosis of autism and the children

523
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,640
without autism and that's the one that's

524
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,359
Landing right here in the middle and

525
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,880
what you can see here is that before

526
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:25,759
medical cannabis it's this very wide

527
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,640
variability this wide range and then

528
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,158
with medical cannabis it corrects

529
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,919
somewhat closer to the typically

530
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,120
developing but it never

531
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,320
achieves uh that kind of uh tight range

532
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:41,519
and so it seems that this particular

533
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:45,960
compound called lysop pe18 to1 can

534
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:47,720
distinguish between Autism and uh and uh

535
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,558
basically make the diagnosis so we're

536
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,558
hoping to do further research on this

537
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:55,558
because currently as we know there is no

538
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,440
test for uh autism and we're hoping that

539
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:00,278
just by collecting saliva we might be

540
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,320
able to uh have some support of the

541
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,440
diagnosis again remember it's a clinical

542
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,000
diagnosis where you answer questions and

543
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,080
it's somewhat

544
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,359
subjective uh Additionally the uh

545
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,879
machine learning documented that there

546
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:15,879
was no evidence of any negative impact

547
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,120
of cannabis that no biomarkers moved

548
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,440
away from the physiologic range but this

549
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,719
may be due to the fact that all of these

550
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,000
patients were on canabo that we knew

551
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,038
were helping them right this was already

552
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,079
personalized data and I suspect that if

553
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:32,400
you were get to get a baseline before

554
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,480
somebody started medical cannabis and

555
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,440
you started some type of uh regimen and

556
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,480
then you checked the metabolites again

557
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,200
you actually might especially if you saw

558
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,278
unwanted behaviors or worsening sleep or

559
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,200
something like that we might see a shift

560
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:49,159
away from the physiologic range um but

561
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,960
the whole idea here is to try to

562
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,159
understand these metabolites and use

563
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,240
them as a tool to follow treatment and

564
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,919
design

565
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,558
regimens and uh this is uh the last um

566
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,640
um uh finding that I'm going to share

567
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:05,359
and to me it's the most exciting is we

568
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,038
discovered a number of biomarkers that

569
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:11,359
were impact by the specific cannabinoids

570
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,640
and so this is truly the understanding

571
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:17,079
of the mechanisms of action so we

572
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,120
understand um which receptors which

573
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,639
Pathways CBD might affect for instance

574
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:25,558
but we don't have the information of the

575
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,440
underlying chemical status of the human

576
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:29,960
being we're treating we're making an

577
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,759
assumption and it's trial and error and

578
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,960
so this data can tell you about the

579
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:37,839
Baseline characteristics so for instance

580
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,240
I'm just going to share a quick story my

581
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,720
parents live in Upstate New York it's

582
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,839
dark most of the year it's like not nice

583
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,278
weather and um the doctor there I had

584
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,759
asked her to check their vitamin D

585
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,679
levels and she said well we don't check

586
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,240
those we just give everybody vitamin D

587
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,919
but wouldn't you want to know I know

588
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,359
everybody's shaking their head you kind

589
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,360
of know where you're starting and where

590
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,959
you're ending up I mean that's kind of

591
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:05,839
how we we practice medicine so needless

592
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,519
to say we don't go to her anymore but um

593
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,240
uh point being that I want to know the

594
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,519
Baseline chemistry and I want to know

595
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,000
what these cannaboids are affecting I'm

596
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:16,440
very happy with the fact that when a

597
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,960
parent tells me the child is doing well

598
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,960
that's great but what about the kids

599
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,400
that I'm struggling to treat because not

600
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,480
everybody responds the same way be like

601
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,000
to understand their chemistry and so um

602
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,319
THC we found was associated with 11

603
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,558
different uh cannabis responsive

604
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:36,678
biomarkers CBD was associated with seven

605
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,359
cannabis responsive biomarkers but

606
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,240
really interesting there was no overlap

607
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,558
so anybody who we've heard over and over

608
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,240
the past two days THC plays a very

609
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,158
important role there are some people who

610
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,640
are sensitive to it but in general if

611
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:53,760
you are only using CBD isolate you are

612
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,840
missing out on some of these Pathways

613
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,278
and may not be achieving uh that full

614
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:03,519
treatment that the uh Pat patient might

615
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:05,720
benefit from CBG was associated with 15

616
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,079
cannabis responsive biomarkers more than

617
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,240
THC and

618
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:14,918
CBD and there was

619
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:19,480
um uh overlap okay so three biomarkers

620
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:23,520
overlapped between uh THC and CBG and

621
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:25,839
only one overlap between CBD and CBG but

622
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,319
what's interesting is there's been some

623
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,959
uh two reports in the literature

624
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,798
reporting that CBG plays uh may have a

625
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,640
uh reside far sorry reside

626
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:41,519
pharmacologically between TC and CBD I

627
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,640
it it has the and and I think it was Dr

628
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:47,000
Russo who mentioned yesterday that CBG

629
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,640
has overlapping effects with both you

630
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,880
can use a lower dose but it's non

631
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,559
impairing and so that gives you a nice

632
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,520
tool to be able to use in these patients

633
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:56,879
and I definitely see benefits with CBG

634
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,960
in these kids if you're treating kids

635
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,440
with autism do not ignore you could

636
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,000
start with CBD and THC but definitely uh

637
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,120
try CBG I've seen a fair amount of

638
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,079
improvement in speech verbal abilities

639
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,479
and

640
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:12,558
focus all right and then here my

641
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,120
research Partners who are brilliant say

642
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,678
this is simplified I don't think there's

643
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,639
anything simple about this um but we

644
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,480
combined the U machine learning data

645
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,240
plus the information we gathered to

646
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,240
create this metabolic uh

647
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,278
pathway and THC is in the green color

648
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,960
and you can see it's strongly linked to

649
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:34,720
endoc canabo metabolic pathways

650
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,440
including uh interacting with anandamide

651
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,600
and

652
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,679
2ag uh CBG which is in like the mauve

653
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:43,319
color was associated with 2ag

654
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:47,159
arachidonic acid and ethanolamine which

655
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:49,359
is a phospholipid THC and CBG were also

656
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,720
associated with a variance of e

657
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,599
ethanolamine which are also

658
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,440
phospholipids you can see those in the

659
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:57,278
green with the red border and CBD is in

660
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,798
blue and was really associated with

661
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:03,038
numid uh numerous lipid-based Pathways

662
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,000
uh in that are involved in influencing

663
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,759
oxidative stress and up in the corner

664
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,720
here what you see it says ASD and

665
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,519
depression what's interesting is we

666
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,159
found some overlap in the scientific

667
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:16,278
literature of these various compounds

668
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,760
that changed quite a bit in response to

669
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:20,880
uh cannabis medicine um that were also

670
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:24,158
involved um in

671
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,880
depression and so how can we use these

672
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,760
uh biomarkers so we can use them as I've

673
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,039
mentioned for diagnosis does this

674
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:34,079
individual have the condition they can

675
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:36,200
be predictive will this patient um

676
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,960
benefit from medical cannabis what if

677
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,640
you get back you do a a saliva test

678
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,798
before you treat and everything is in

679
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,919
the optimal range is that a person that

680
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:47,359
you necessarily need to treat I would

681
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,880
still always offer treatment if there

682
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,599
were issues but at least it gives you

683
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,600
that Baseline status to and and have

684
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:56,359
expectations pre-dosing which I'm going

685
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,839
to show you a slide what about dosing

686
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:01,959
and cannabinoid profile what should we

687
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,278
pick first um response how well is the

688
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,679
individual

689
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,079
responding and also what's the response

690
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,559
over time is it maintaining I will tell

691
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:14,278
you that puberty really rocks this

692
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,558
community uh they become uh much uh for

693
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,159
many of them they become much more

694
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:20,158
aggressive they have more sleep issues

695
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,399
they can be perfectly dialed in on their

696
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,080
cannabis and then they hit like 13 and

697
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,918
all of a sudden it all falls apart and I

698
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,079
always call kids moving Targets in the

699
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:30,720
Cannabis World cuz you're const

700
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,439
constantly changing things um but here I

701
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,839
want to just show you one last slide I

702
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,798
have a perfect minute and 40 SEC uh 40

703
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:40,158
seconds so here is the unhappy child

704
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,759
that comes into my office and this is

705
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,960
their heat map this shows you and again

706
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,919
red is symptomatic the dark blue is

707
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,120
physiologic and the light blue is

708
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,600
optimal so this child really does not

709
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,278
have anything in the optimal range uh

710
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,839
and all that red there and by the way

711
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,798
you can look at this and then when you

712
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,798
repeat the test you can just compare the

713
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:01,759
p

714
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,759
individually but if we have a database

715
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,079
and here I have another patient who has

716
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,879
a very similar profile that's already

717
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,439
being treated you could see I think

718
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,720
they're happy over here and you can see

719
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:16,159
that these uh you get correction

720
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,480
shifting towards that physiologic range

721
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,760
that gives us a chance to kind of dial

722
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,038
in treatment and not have to be so trial

723
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,038
and error and not have to look for every

724
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,640
cue and so it gives us a chance to

725
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,558
follow these patients so I'm really

726
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,038
excited to do more research

727
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,319
um this um uh technology can be applied

728
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,839
to we're looking at doing some research

729
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,200
um with some uh people in New York for

730
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,000
dementia uh we're trying to work with

731
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,558
some people in Canada to look at this

732
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,480
for epilepsy as well and then Ethan and

733
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:47,200
I have talked about using this to see if

734
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,200
there's any

735
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,200
metabolic uh changes in patients with

736
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,440
CHS and so uh and uh there's a fair

737
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,159
amount of application and this at least

738
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,960
is by the way you can send a kit to to

739
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,720
somebody's house they can collect Sal

740
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,319
saliva and send it in it's

741
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,600
noninvasive and um uh very easy and also

742
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,740
lowc cost so uh thank you very much I'm

743
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,719
happy to answer any questions

744
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,430
[Applause]

745
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,608
