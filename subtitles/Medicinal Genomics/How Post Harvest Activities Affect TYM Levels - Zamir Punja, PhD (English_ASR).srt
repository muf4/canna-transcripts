[Music]

2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:17,579
all right

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:20,100
a lot of it isn't so much what happens

4
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:23,219
during the growing of the plant but it's

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,800
in the post-harvest activities uh the

6
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,479
drying the curing and the trimming

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,060
um I wonder if you could speak a bit

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,920
about what you found around that sort of

9
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,299
activity yeah yeah so that that's a

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,920
that's another aspect that's super

11
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,839
important so let's leave the grower

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,280
aside you know you've you've picked up a

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,859
whole batch of

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,600
harvested flour and now you're deciding

15
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,058
how am I going to trim this do I want to

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,920
do you know the standard wet trim where

17
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,320
you push all the flowers through into uh

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,120
into a trimmer and then dry the

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,759
individual the buds or do you want to

20
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,500
hang dry where everything is left intact

21
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,839
and then you know the moisture is taken

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,719
out and then you can trim off your your

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,219
leaves we found a pretty uh big

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,400
difference between

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,439
um hang dry and and wet trim the wet

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,618
trim creates some damage obviously to

27
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,618
the to the leaves and releases chemicals

28
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,819
or or nutrients that a lot of moles that

29
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,000
might be present particularly

30
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:20,459
penicillium start to feed on it and grow

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,219
so even on during the drying process

32
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:26,158
you're seeing buildup of these moles in

33
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,379
a flower that's been trimmed wet on the

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,540
other hand when you dry this thing first

35
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,719
uh you're not allowing these these wound

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,240
sites or broken off leaves as a source

37
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,239
for mold that needs to get in the entire

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,478
flower structure is dried you've you've

39
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,219
eliminated 90 of your yeast and mold and

40
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,799
then when you start trimming it as a as

41
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,420
a dry trim we found the the eastern wall

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,280
levels were way lower

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,219
so that's one thing that definitely will

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,780
make a difference a lot of Growers are

45
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,938
using the handguard system they'll

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,099
probably find they don't have as many as

47
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,379
much issues with yeast and mold

48
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,239
we didn't look at anything beyond that

49
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,179
in other words you know the curing

50
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,579
process or the packaging and storing

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,979
process I think All Growers know that

52
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,719
when you store inappropriate humidity or

53
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,000
temperatures you're gonna get build up

54
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,400
of yeast and mold and they know that if

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,020
you cure them too long or under high

56
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,879
moisture you're going to get yeast in

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,640
mold so we didn't really look at that

58
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,259
aspect we kind of stopped right at the

59
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,299
point where the flowers had been trimmed

60
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:30,359
whether it's wet or dry and then

61
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,700
collected data from that

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,459
no that's interesting so do you have any

63
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:37,919
idea like in terms of percentage what

64
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,479
Growers are typically doing is it more

65
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,518
common for them to be doing wet trimming

66
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,619
versus dry they're shifting a lot

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,120
towards dry trim because it's less work

68
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,739
in a sense you know you can bring the

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,659
flowers into the dryer rooms hang them

70
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,480
and then and then deal with them later

71
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,818
the drying process itself is very

72
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,919
detrimental to yeast and mode which is

73
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:58,378
obviously a good thing you know when you

74
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,539
have dry herbs and dry products dried

75
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,039
figs and they tend to last a lot longer

76
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,159
because the moisture is taken out of

77
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,840
them similarly with dried flour the

78
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,419
problem is that you never get down to

79
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,219
zero I've never seen a dried flower get

80
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,839
down to zero more Eastern more there's

81
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:15,419
always a fraction that still hangs

82
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,519
around and that that population can

83
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,378
always build up later on if if the

84
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,360
storage conditions aren't right

85
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:25,079
but if you're coming in with a very high

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,120
Eastern mole load then nothing you do

87
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,040
after harvest it's going to bring all of

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,379
it down to zero so there's two two

89
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,359
components try to reduce the Eastern

90
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,699
mold while you're growing and then after

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,379
you harvest and bring it in try to do

92
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,899
things that will reduce the yeast and

93
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:43,459
mold even further in that in that

94
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,459
product that you're handling

95
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:55,539

96
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,590
