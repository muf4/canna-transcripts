00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,679
[Music]

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,480
all right I want to talk to you about

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,160
some of like what are some of the common

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,600
pests or problems that cannabis Growers

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,039
just always seem to be dealing with I

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,880
would say the uh four most common things

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,480
that I run into traveling the country

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:34,079
are going to be thrips rud AIDS pop and

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,079
vroid and powdery mildew thrips can be

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,439
kind of a problem because a lot of times

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,960
folks will only attack one life cycle

12
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:42,959
stage of this infestation thrips

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,558
actually have a point where they live in

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,160
the canopy and they have a point where

15
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,359
they live in the strata of your media

16
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,759
and so if you're not treating both

17
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,039
you're going to see these es and flows

18
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:51,558
where they're gone for two weeks they

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,520
come back they're gone for two weeks

20
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:56,479
they come back and so you know educating

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,039
Growers that doing a sprunch application

22
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,959
with thrips really does allow them to

23
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,239
get ahead of it uh rud IDs are extremely

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,198
hard to get rid of just because they're

25
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,438
incredibly Adept at what people have

26
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:08,359
been throwing at them um what I found to

27
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:10,639
be the most effective method to attack

28
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,680
rud AIDS is to actually do an irrigation

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,879
cycle before you do any drenches or

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,360
sprays they run away from that moisture

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,879
of the first irrigation cycle of the day

32
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,200
if we can get those pots wet and get

33
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,959
them complacent to the fact that that

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,799
moisture is there they're less apt to

35
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,078
try to run away and so whatever we're

36
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,000
putting out via a drench sprunch or

37
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:29,559
spray is going to have much better

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
likelihood of actually coming in contact

39
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,879
with them because they're not just

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,159
trying to run from it um popat and vroid

41
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:37,239
is something

42
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,320
that a lot of Growers have it but they

43
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:41,399
don't know they have it until they have

44
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,359
it and again this comes back to that

45
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,159
cultural practices thing and you know it

46
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,118
kind of falls on everybody and just the

47
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,399
communication that vroid can be

48
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,478
transferred via dirty matter it can be

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,960
transferred mechanically so it grow goes

50
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,759
from one plant to another doesn't wash

51
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,559
his hands it can be spread by tools it

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,560
can be spread by runoff it can be spread

53
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,759
by insects is a very prevalent path

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,280
and a lot of folks don't take it as

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,599
seriously as they should there are some

56
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,280
grows that have completely realized that

57
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,038
it can decimate their business and they

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,759
will test their moms before they take

59
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,919
Cuts every single Round And they're

60
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,199
they're doing everything they need to

61
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,159
and then there are Growers that still

62
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,719
use a single cup of clonex and dip every

63
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,680
single cut in that same hormone and it's

64
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,560
like if if there's any contamination you

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,400
guys just spread it across the board so

66
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,920
you know honestly I feel like the the

67
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,480
viroids and path are going to be the

68
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,839
hardest thing for the Cannabis industry

69
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,199
to address because you don't know that

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,959
you have them until you have them and

71
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,639
once you have them we can go into

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,920
remission so to speak we can you know

73
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,719
get it to a point where the plant can

74
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,639
still finish but those genetics are

75
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,719
contaminated at that point and to keep

76
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,199
them on board would be to you know

77
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,680
facilitate the downfall of everything

78
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,199
else that you have in your stable

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,040
because again that can transfer so many

80
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,199
different ways and so easily and the

81
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,840
thing that a lot of grower the latent

82
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,238
portion of this thyroid if your plants

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,519
are healthy you're not going to see what

84
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,878
it can do right away but over time the

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,920
plant Health starts to go down it's

86
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,798
almost like cancer or you know the the

87
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,238
patient isn't necessarily bedridden when

88
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,439
they're first diagnosed but the longer

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,840
they are alive that line goes like this

90
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,919
and the sicker they become and you know

91
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,680
to compromise an entire business with

92
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,559
hlv is just it's very scary because it

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,239
will compromise your Harvest your THC

94
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,959
percentages blumm it your bag appeal

95
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,519
goes down and the medicinal value of the

96
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,039
plant is just not there anymore you know

97
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,200
your basically growing hemp at that

98
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,318
point like you're compliant with the

99
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,839
farm bill

100
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:38,719
almost

101
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:42,039
um the uh I'm sorry the no I I never

102
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,759
thought of it that way the uh the last

103
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,639
you know most common pathogen that I see

104
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,679
is powdery mildew just because it is

105
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,079
very prevalent it's easy to pop up it's

106
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,640
not the end of the world a lot of times

107
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,480
Growers won't do everything they need to

108
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,798
do to eliminate said issue but uh it is

109
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,840
something that can be gotten rid of

110
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,879
Fairly easily um first thing I always

111
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,920
tell people is make sure your

112
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:06,158
environment's on point if you can't set

113
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,878
your temp to 60 and your deu to 10 and

114
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,479
then hit those numbers your environment

115
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:11,158
isn't where it needs to be you know

116
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,639
there there are folks that say oh I can

117
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,078
get it to where it needs to be and if if

118
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,918
you can't hit those parameters it's not

119
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,600
and so the first thing Growers have to

120
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,439
do is make sure that their HVAC is up to

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,000
point their you know air conditioning is

122
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,759
up to point their deu is where it needs

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,319
to be and if they're still experiencing

124
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,759
powdery Milo that's when we say okay

125
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,120
let's look at what we can spray to you

126
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,520
know basically kind of Hind this thing

127
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,600
in its tracks and we've got some really

128
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,478
cool options for cannabis Growers that

129
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,000
have uh you know very safe application

130
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,959
uh methods and you know zero residual

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,600
aspects in terms of dangerous stuff um

132
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,519
and you know it just allows them to

133
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,720
basically get on that schedule of like

134
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,918
okay it's it's flip we got to spray oxy

135
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
fos and zerol or you know it's Wednesday

136
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,799
we got to hit a a Mico

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,639
insecticide and you know to touch on

138
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,319
what you kind of said earlier in my

139
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,600
program Monday Wednesday Friday for

140
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,879
prevent is spray days Tuesday and

141
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,800
Thursday is plant work and scouting and

142
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,439
then once we get uh from you know

143
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,680
basically Curative into preventative I'm

144
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,879
sorry I said that wrong I said

145
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,639
preventative but I meant Curative um

146
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,399
once we get into the preventative mode

147
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,160
we actually flip it and Monday Wednesday

148
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,478
Friday we're doing scouting Tuesday

149
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,759
Thursday we're doing our sprays um but

150
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:23,120
the idea is that you are in there

151
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,800
looking at the plants as much as you're

152
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,918
spraying or defoliating or doing

153
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,720
anything else because we have to

154
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,399
evaluate our progress and you know keep

155
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,120
a lot of logs if if we don't write down

156
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,758
what doing in a month we won't remember

157
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,160
what we did we don't know if we did

158
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,000
anything right or not you know grows are

159
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,840
very cyclical in terms of what happened

160
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,519
last June likely is going to happen this

161
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,439
June and so if you can go back to your

162
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,198
log last year and say [ __ ] we had thrips

163
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:45,319
on the 14th when it got really hot and

164
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,000
then you look at your calendar and you

165
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,160
