1
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,000
well hello

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,599
um first i really want to take time to

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,599
thank brian brendan

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,960
kevin and doug for hosting and

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,759
organizing this conference

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,679
i think it highlights how complicated

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
and complex this field is

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,719
we've gotten to hear from a lot of

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,560
different perspectives on

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,198
what's happening in this cannabis

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,079
research world

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,920
i do come at this with two hats so i

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,799
professionally represent

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,800
tilray which is a federally licensed

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,599
medical cannabis producer

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,878
in canada and i'm their director of

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,200
clinical research

18
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,839
but i also have a personal story that is

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,600
relevant to how i got into this position

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,879
and i'll start with that story so i

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,198
received my phd in neuroscience back in

22
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:56,799
2005

23
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,799
and then went on to complete my training

24
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,919
at ucsf as a postdoc

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,319
as most researchers do and when our

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
second son ben was born

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,519
i had to take an extended leave of

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,040
absence

29
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,599
so ben started having seizures when he

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,799
was

31
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,319
14 weeks old and we were told that he

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,680
would most likely grow out of it

33
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,758
and not to worry too much so

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,439
we can we started with the conventional

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,879
treatments and

36
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,959
actually none of the therapies that he

37
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,000
was put on helped so

38
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,839
he continued to seize relentlessly as we

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,359
tried medication after medication after

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
medication

41
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,920
when he was a year and a half old we we

42
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,399
were told by our epileptologist that we

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
we should try a vagus nerve stimulator

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
this is like a pacemaker that goes in

45
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,078
under the skin right here

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
and has a wire that leads up to the

47
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,000
vagus nerve and attaches

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,320
and then and and then they send

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,719
electrical signals up to the brain

50
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,919
to try to stop seizures that surgery

51
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,039
didn't work

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,879
um so we continued to try more and more

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,920
combinations of therapies

54
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,679
um he ended up on higher doses and and

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
more drugs than we had wanted him to be

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,239
on ever in his life

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,959
he wasn't developing well around 2012

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,439
i was living near stanford and i had

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,080
found

60
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,759
at stanford these three basic scientists

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,040
who were working in the epilepsy field

62
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,000
and they were offering a competitive

63
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,598
fellowship to join

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,560
them so i applied for the fellowship and

65
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,280
miraculously got got accepted and

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,719
started in

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,560
in may of 2012 at stanford and my goal

68
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,439
really was just to contribute to our

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,759
overall base

70
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,759
knowledge of this disease to figure out

71
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,239
how we could develop new therapies

72
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,959
for this third of patients with epilepsy

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
that

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,280
continue to have seizures despite all of

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
the 40 or so available

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,318
fda approved anti-seizure drugs on the

77
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,159
market

78
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:56,958
and dr guytanis mentioned this earlier

79
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,598
at stanford i soon after i started

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,400
actually i went to a conference and this

81
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,000
conference was unusual because it

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,920
included a family day

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,598
that encouraged families without

84
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,518
scientific training to come and learn

85
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,839
about the new therapies being developed

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,680
it was a conference that was hosted by

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,439
the epilepsy therapy project

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,959
which was developed by another father of

89
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,000
a child with severe epilepsy named

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,598
warren lammert

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,439
a really wonderful organization that has

92
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,560
since merged with the epilepsy therapy

93
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,759
project

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
at this family day i met a dad who told

95
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,039
me that he was treating his son with

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
cannabis

97
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,280
and i said what do you mean you're

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,599
treating your son with cannabis

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
how old is your son and he said my son's

100
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,839
five

101
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,599
and i was incredulous i i mean i don't

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,598
i don't know much about cannabis and

103
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,759
children but i know that you can't

104
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,238
you can't really expect a delayed child

105
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,318
to inhale cannabis and i had no idea how

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,319
people were giving giving their children

107
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,119
cannabis other than that i also knew

108
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,438
that

109
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,039
that there's a lot in cannabis and i

110
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,759
couldn't figure out how he was

111
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,759
determining what to give the child but

112
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:06,000
he insisted it was helping him a lot

113
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:08,079
and um he said he would take

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,680
cannabis rich in cannabidiol and make

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
butters and give his son you know a

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
teaspoon or so a day

117
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,639
so i took this information and went back

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,918
to my computer and looked up cannabidiol

119
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,519
and epilepsy

120
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,519
and the first studies that popped up

121
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
were of course dr mushulum studies

122
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,360
um the clinical trials that he did in

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,560
collaboration with the brazilians in

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,680
1978 and

125
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,399
80. and they were encouraging so

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,079
like he showed earlier uh at least half

127
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,599
of the patients were really responding

128
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,039
well to cannabidiol

129
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
and remember these are patients that

130
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,720
were treatment resistant so a difficult

131
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,520
to treat population

132
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,199
that was responding to this dose of

133
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,879
cannabidiol that was around two to three

134
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,439
hundred milligrams

135
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,439
per day that was encouraging and then i

136
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,478
also found these animal studies

137
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,040
and in the animal studies cbd either had

138
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,240
no effect or it was anti-convulsive

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,039
whereas thc

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,879
could be pro or anti-convulsive so i got

141
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,959
a little nervous about thc and decided

142
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,159
to proceed with cbd

143
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:10,159
and i found a dispensary

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
i found a medical marijuana card i

145
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,120
bought

146
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,079
anything that was rich in cbd and

147
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,478
and then i said oh shoot what do i do

148
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,560
with this

149
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,038
i don't really know i'm not a chemist i

150
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,038
can't give my son this this

151
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,038
plant material he was three years old

152
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,879
very developmentally delayed

153
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,399
so i went to uc davis and found a

154
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,478
professor of chemistry

155
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,918
who also happened to have a medical

156
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,839
marijuana testing lab

157
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,079
told him our story and he agreed to help

158
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,159
me figure out how to extract the

159
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,839
cannabinoids all the cannabinoids and

160
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,639
then remove the thc

161
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,239
so extraction was not hard it was the

162
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,918
column purification that led to the

163
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,519
removal of the thc that was most

164
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,439
difficult

165
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,079
but we did it and we were able to get

166
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,918
you know a little uh

167
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,159
a little tube full of cannabidiol that

168
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,680
was very concentrated

169
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
so now i had this little tube and i

170
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,400
didn't know where to start as far as

171
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,079
dosing and i did this all telling my

172
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,000
doctor that i was doing it he was fully

173
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,199
supportive and he said great go for it

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,720
yes we've heard

175
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,639
parents are treating their kids with up

176
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,080
with cannabinoids but i have no idea

177
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,400
what to tell you what to get

178
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,439
where to get it or how much to give him

179
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,959
so i

180
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,959
emailed dr mitchulum and i and i said

181
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,239
i found your papers i have this son with

182
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,038
severe epilepsy

183
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,079
i have some cbd what do i do what what

184
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,918
are your thoughts

185
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,680
he was very kind and emailed me back

186
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,680
right away and said

187
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
oh i don't know start with the lowest

188
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,959
doses we used in our clinical trials it

189
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,879
was very safe

190
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,359
and so i did that and interestingly the

191
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,319
lowest dose they used was 200 milligrams

192
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
of cbd

193
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
at the time ben weighed 10 ml 10

194
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,918
kilograms

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,598
so if you remember dr davinski's talk

196
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,000
about the epidiolex trial

197
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,519
it's 20 milligrams per kilogram that

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,680
happened to be right in the

199
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,839
appropriate dose of cannabidiol which i

200
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,439
think is interesting

201
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:03,918
so i gave it to ben and he responded

202
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,279
and he was doing better when he had you

203
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,399
know after a few days of having this

204
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,359
cannabidiol

205
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,079
so now making this medication in my

206
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,319
garage

207
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,079
with my homemade chemistry set became

208
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
absolutely nerve-wracking

209
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,918
and it was nerve-wracking because there

210
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,800
was no way to set up a consistent way to

211
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,519
do it so

212
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,000
i never could get a consistent supply of

213
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,918
the same kind of cannabis to start with

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,038
and i never could get even a consistent

215
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,758
supply of the

216
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,918
of the c18 beads that filled each column

217
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,598
so i wasn't able to you know reproduce

218
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,439
it every time

219
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,519
and i thought there must be a better way

220
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,719
so i contacted gw pharma

221
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,799
hoping that they would be willing to

222
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,000
make a pharmaceutical version

223
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,038
of pure cbd for me and they didn't get

224
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,720
back to me and

225
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,159
everyone told me that i was crazy to

226
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
have thought they might consider giving

227
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,280
this medically fragile child

228
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,120
a cannabinoid at that time it seems like

229
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,119
it's a no-brainer now that they would do

230
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,199
it but back then it was really a risky

231
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,399
thing to do it was risky politically

232
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,680
and it was um it was still a cannabinoid

233
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,120
even though it wasn't thc

234
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,120
and so i just assumed they weren't

235
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,478
interested in in treating this

236
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
this difficult to treat medically

237
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,120
fragile population so i continued to

238
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
make um cannabidiol and then i shared it

239
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,720
with another family who had met

240
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,360
and i had met his son the son had a

241
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,039
very severe form of epilepsy and had

242
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
hundreds of seizures a day

243
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,878
and this family also had a hard time

244
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,759
finding cbd so i shared the cbd with

245
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,160
them

246
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,080
and unlike my son's kind of more

247
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
tempered response this family's response

248
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,959
was incredible

249
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,240
so this child went from having hundreds

250
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,359
of seizures a day

251
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,158
to a couple seizures a day and

252
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,639
that family being very very motivated of

253
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,838
course was able to get through to gw

254
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,159
pharma's founder jeffrey guy

255
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,440
and jeffrey guy is an interesting man

256
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,278
he's very charismatic

257
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,880
and he's also he wants to help and

258
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,958
he want but he wanted to know if it was

259
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,360
pure cbd we were giving our children

260
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,239
or some combination of cbd and thc

261
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,240
because

262
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,399
that would be trickier to address so we

263
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,080
had our samples tested at nida

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,759
and lo and behold it came back without

265
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,639
any thc in it

266
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,240
so that launched a series of events that

267
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,159
is really well recounted in

268
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,399
fred fogelstein's article that was

269
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,600
published last year in wired magazine

270
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,799
really worth reading um which i won't go

271
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,320
into now but it was really the

272
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,879
collective effort of

273
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,200
these families um in particular dr

274
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,679
davinsky and jeffrey guy

275
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,320
to to go through all their hoops to make

276
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,199
this happen

277
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,879
for us to get compassionate use inds

278
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,440
opened in the u.s

279
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,639
with fda approval nda approval so that

280
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,160
we could get

281
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,360
cannabidiol through our doctors

282
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,360
and i wish i could tell you that this

283
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,639
was the end of our story it's it's the

284
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,639
end of that boy's story

285
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,240
because his response was amazing it's

286
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,759
not the end of our story because my

287
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,240
son's response was

288
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,080
like i said more tempered i reported a

289
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,720
seizure frequency reduction of about 40

290
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,278
percent

291
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,600
to our doctor and she decided that that

292
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,879
wasn't enough of a response to warrant

293
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,120
the continued use of this

294
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,078
investigational drug so

295
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,639
against my wishes and and begging her

296
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,039
not to

297
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,000
she still removed him from the ind and

298
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,078
so

299
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,759
two years later we were right where we

300
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,199
started which was

301
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,200
knowing that we had something that might

302
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,759
potentially help him

303
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,759
and but not having access to it so that

304
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:29,360
was in 2014

305
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:31,039
and over the next two years i spent um

306
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,399
i probably spent one one and a half of

307
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,319
those years trying all sorts of

308
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,919
artisanal preparations

309
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
you know all without the guidance of our

310
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,199
doctor and i don't feel qualified to

311
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,440
treat brain disease i'm not an

312
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
epileptologist i think it puts a huge

313
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
burden on the family when the family has

314
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
to

315
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,519
manage medications and decide what dose

316
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,039
to give

317
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,278
and make sure that it doesn't have any

318
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,559
bad side effects or interactions with

319
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,000
other drugs

320
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,159
so i was very uncomfortable doing this

321
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,159
and i also all the preparations that i

322
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,278
got i could never

323
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,120
fully quantify um

324
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,320
like different testing labs would give

325
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,519
me different results

326
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,959
and i was never 100

327
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,278
sure of the dose that was in these

328
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,399
products but i would give them to ben

329
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,320
in the hopes that it at least wouldn't

330
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,159
hurt him and then one time i gave him

331
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,278
something that made his seizures much

332
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,919
much worse

333
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,919
and that was the worst feeling as a

334
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,679
parent

335
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,759
to know that you gave your child

336
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,199
something in an experimental way

337
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,600
hoping it would help him and then watch

338
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,160
him deteriorate over the next two days

339
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,278
so after that happened i i decided i

340
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,919
couldn't keep trying

341
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,399
with these artisanal preparations of cbd

342
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,679
and see

343
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,480
there were always some combination of

344
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,838
cbd and thc so my guess is that my child

345
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,200
is one of the children that does not

346
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,200
respond well to thc

347
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:51,679
um now thanks to another ind

348
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,920
by with another doctor we do have access

349
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:58,078
to epidialex again

350
00:11:53,919 --> 00:12:00,319
and i i really want to

351
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,679
publicly thank gw pharma for everything

352
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
they've done for me

353
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,039
and for all the children who have

354
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,720
treatment resistant epilepsy because

355
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,759
starting this program was not

356
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,920
easy there were a lot of hurdles to

357
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,278
overcome it was costly and it was risky

358
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,399
on their part to do it

359
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,799
back in 2013. and

360
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,039
and and it's thanks to them today that i

361
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,919
have access the the current doctor that

362
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,958
ben's

363
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,479
seeing actually was willing to rearrange

364
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,000
his other drug regimen

365
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,839
and he's on a regimen that includes

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,879
three drugs epidiolex

367
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,200
is one of them and he's been

368
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,000
he's had no generalized tonic-clonic

369
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,040
seizure in

370
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,039
over four months no i can't but

371
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,439
but it's i mean for us it's just not

372
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,120
that simple because he's still having

373
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,240
these little seconds long seizures

374
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,159
during the day

375
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
i honestly can't say whether it's the

376
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,039
epidialex that in the end

377
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,078
was the magic potion that was part of

378
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,679
this concoction

379
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,159
that helped control his seizures it's

380
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,879
hard to know i mean maybe it was just

381
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,639
natural development of the disease and

382
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,240
that's the problem with these n of one

383
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,519
trials right you never

384
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,560
really know why you're seeing the result

385
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,519
you're seeing

386
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,559
and the goal now i think with all of

387
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,120
these stories

388
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,159
is to try to figure out how to

389
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,639
generalize

390
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,879
these individual responses to a larger

391
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,680
population and understand how drugs

392
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,720
affect

393
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:29,278
certain certain specific diseases

394
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,360
and epilepsy for one i mean they chose

395
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,480
dravet syndrome to focus on because

396
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
epilepsy is not one disease there are

397
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,079
many

398
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,479
there are hundreds of different

399
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,198
ideologically distinct

400
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,320
mechanisms that lead to seizures so when

401
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:43,919
you want to do

402
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,519
good clean clinical research and

403
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,799
epilepsy

404
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,240
it's really smart to stratify them by

405
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,679
you know by their distinct ideology

406
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,278
right it doesn't make sense to throw

407
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,919
everybody into the same

408
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:57,919
category

409
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,838
so i would say that the current system

410
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,000
fails patience and this is just

411
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,720
illustrated in my story because in the

412
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
state-based

413
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
in california where we have state-based

414
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,480
medical cannabis

415
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,560
regulations the major issues i ran into

416
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
were the lack of a safe and reliable

417
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,039
product

418
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,720
so if you're going to treat something as

419
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,559
severe as epilepsy

420
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,000
you have to find that product but then

421
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,078
you'll you have to be able to go back

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,519
and find it over and over and over again

423
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,599
there can't be this question of whether

424
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,839
or not it will be available to you

425
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,120
next month or next year it has to be

426
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,639
there all the time

427
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,919
and without these safe and reliable

428
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,079
products i felt like i didn't get

429
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,319
adequate medical supervision for ben

430
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,078
and i was on my own treating this very

431
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,320
severe brain disease and completely

432
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,479
unqualified to do that

433
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,079
and on the fda side i think you have

434
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,079
accessibility issues

435
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:56,319
as i illustrated i think the the there's

436
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,359
the fear maybe that a physician will be

437
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,760
a gatekeeper

438
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
i think that's probably going to be rare

439
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,559
but it happened

440
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,000
and when it did happen i had no recourse

441
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,919
i couldn't apply to the fda

442
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,078
i went everywhere i went to the director

443
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,319
of epilepsy center at ucsf

444
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,078
i went to the fda i went to gw pharma i

445
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,360
went to everyone i could think of to

446
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,519
you know ask to remain

447
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,800
on epidiolex but i couldn't there was

448
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,078
nothing we could do and i don't want

449
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,838
another patient to have to

450
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,759
be in that position so i think

451
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,720
accessibility is a concern when you go

452
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,720
through the fda

453
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,839
process and then there are of course i

454
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,920
mean we'd be remiss

455
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,120
not to mention insurance coverage and

456
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,198
cost issues

457
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,879
which i don't think are necessarily

458
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,799
going to be a problem but it's an issue

459
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,000
that i want to bring up

460
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,399
because it's something we have to think

461
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,198
about i think

462
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,039
no one can argue that that gw pharma is

463
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,559
not doing the right thing in conducting

464
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,319
these trials they have to conduct these

465
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,159
trials and if they

466
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,639
had decided not to move ahead with these

467
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,639
trials there would have been

468
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,240
a lot of backlash in them not doing the

469
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,759
work they needed to do for this patient

470
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,198
population

471
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,120
so i think it's excellent that they're

472
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,958
moving ahead and that they're getting

473
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,560
real clinical data

474
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:15,119
and as you heard oren said

475
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:16,719
there's actually no way we could treat

476
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,959
patients without that data in an

477
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,199
informed way

478
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,159
so just to illustrate i think right now

479
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,758
we have

480
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,679
a sliver of the patients who could

481
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,959
benefit let's just take the epilepsy

482
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,958
patients there are three million

483
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,799
patients with epilepsy in the u.s

484
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,039
you have a tiny sliver of these patients

485
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,359
accessing cannabinoids for therapy

486
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,319
that could that could really potentially

487
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,879
benefit them

488
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,720
and my goal is to make that a much

489
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,278
larger piece of the pie

490
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,040
and i think we can do that collectively

491
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,480
by mainstreaming this medicine

492
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,719
but there are a few requirements to

493
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,440
mainstream the medicine and it requires

494
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,639
a lot of

495
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
really hard work um the first thing we

496
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,240
need is clinical data

497
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,639
physicians prescribe medications based

498
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,320
on the data you give them and normally

499
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,639
they get data from clinical trials

500
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,160
like the data that oren presented and

501
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,318
they take that data

502
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,319
and they start prescribing and they get

503
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,438
experience prescribing

504
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,599
and you know over time it's the data

505
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,279
from clinical trials plus the experience

506
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,719
they have prescribing the drug in

507
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,599
individual cases

508
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,360
i would say every patient is an n of one

509
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,879
and should be treated like an n of one

510
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,479
right and you should maximize treatment

511
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,280
for that end of one patient

512
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,880
and over time doctors assimilate both

513
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,798
sets of information to provide the best

514
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,280
treatment they can

515
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,960
and they can't do that without the basic

516
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,720
clinical data that is currently

517
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,798
completely lacking in this field

518
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,558
that would be data on safe dose and

519
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,639
titration schedules

520
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,240
basic safety profiles in specific

521
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,840
patient populations

522
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,919
like kevin was mentioning earlier

523
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,038
patients on valproate and

524
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:54,400
cbd have a higher risk of liver failure

525
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:56,240
right side effects profiles need to be

526
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,120
known adverse events drug drug

527
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,160
interactions and then expected outcomes

528
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,918
or efficacy data

529
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,160
would be also really good down the road

530
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,840
and i think the major hurdle to being

531
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,360
able to collect this clinical data has

532
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,720
been a lack of appropriate medical

533
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,959
preparations

534
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,679
and this is one of the reasons why

535
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,640
i think we have to really think

536
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,240
carefully about

537
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,480
the preparations that we're giving

538
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,599
patients when we talk about collecting

539
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,919
clinical data

540
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,279
so data collection is actually a

541
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,600
rigorous

542
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,279
a rigorous discipline it requires a lot

543
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,000
of work and thought

544
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,200
and unless you have the right compound

545
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,079
the right chemical

546
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,080
and the dose the chemical composition

547
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,119
and a really safe product

548
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,279
you can't get the kind of clinical data

549
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,000
you need that you can interpret then

550
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,519
and use the products have to be

551
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
chemically defined obviously and they

552
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,679
have to be

553
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,679
reliable and reproducible

554
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,200
so i think it's encouraging that the

555
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,038
current spectrum of regulations are

556
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,720
changing at a rapid rate

557
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,960
but i would argue that most of the

558
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,640
regulations popping up in new countries

559
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,640
like

560
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:12,400
germany and australia and uh

561
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,720
croatia they're all governing access

562
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,798
even even all the u.s states right they

563
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,400
govern access

564
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,160
to medical marijuana but they're not

565
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,360
governing production practices of

566
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,200
medical marijuana

567
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,359
and you have to have both and you have

568
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
to have a set of thoughtful regulations

569
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,599
at the federal level

570
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,360
that govern production practices so that

571
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,038
you can get the preparations you need

572
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,479
for medical use

573
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,240
now remember i'm talking about a

574
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,160
spectrum of cannabis use

575
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:43,279
from adult to you know wellness

576
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,679
therapeutic and medical and everything i

577
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,480
say

578
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
completely fits into this medical piece

579
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,839
of

580
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,440
medical cannabis use you can't define a

581
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,480
medicine unless you have a defined

582
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,200
chemical composition

583
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,640
so i work for tilray like i said earlier

584
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,440
and the reason i work for tilray is

585
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,000
because

586
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,600
i think tillwright arguably is the only

587
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,079
country in the world that has a

588
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,000
federal that has a federal oversight of

589
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,480
the production of medical cannabis that

590
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,038
can be

591
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,960
shipped directly to patients and just a

592
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,119
few months ago we also got health canada

593
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,960
approval to make extracts

594
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,639
and i feel like a broken record but

595
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,480
without these extracts with a defined

596
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,280
chemical composition that are completely

597
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,360
safe

598
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,720
we can't start our clinical trials so

599
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,038
now that we have those

600
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,200
we can start providing study drugs to

601
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:32,558
researchers globally

602
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,159
and and we are so i wish i had data

603
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,960
already maybe next year we'll have some

604
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,280
data

605
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,880
but we're partnering with the university

606
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,119
of sydney in australia for a

607
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,080
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting

608
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,759
study

609
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,240
and we'll be providing them with a

610
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:50,319
liquid capsule form of a defined

611
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:53,759
chemical content we really hope to see

612
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,918
good efficacy there and

613
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,839
in canada we're partnering with the

614
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,919
ontario brain institute to look at the

615
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,000
effects of cannabinoids on in adults

616
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,240
with refractory epilepsy

617
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and these are two types of trials that

618
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,440
actually give you the data you need for

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,119
regulatory approval

620
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,320
they're very stringent they're rigorous

621
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,759
they're difficult to do they have

622
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,759
placebo controls

623
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,599
and i think oren did a nice job of

624
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,240
explaining the difference between

625
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,119
rcts or randomized placebo-controlled

626
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,759
trials

627
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,319
and open label trials so from open label

628
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,440
trials

629
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,759
and databases if they're done well you

630
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,240
can get really good information on

631
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,960
how to treat your patients and we all

632
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,720
know that

633
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,279
we're not going to wait for rcts to

634
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,519
finish while patients need help

635
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,639
so i would argue that the path forward

636
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,480
has to involve both

637
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,159
happening at the same time as quickly as

638
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,400
possible and i would

639
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,000
i would put in a plea to everyone to

640
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,360
fully collaborate

641
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,440
on getting these trials done because

642
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,479
i spoke with nick lynceris yesterday

643
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,840
about

644
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,000
clinical research he's a clinical

645
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,480
trialist from australia very forward

646
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,159
thinking

647
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,159
in this field and you know the end of 40

648
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,720
trials the end of 20 the end of 40 the

649
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,360
end of 30 many of those trials are not

650
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,480
the same

651
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,399
as a few good end of 3 000 trials

652
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,159
and so i think that's how we collaborate

653
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,559
to get the real data that will inform

654
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,559
treatment

655
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,320
and so i want to leave you with a

656
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,400
a quote by a good friend of mine tom

657
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,359
baruch who said when science gets

658
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,919
politicized

659
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,798
rational discourse disappears and i feel

660
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,480
like

661
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,319
that really has happened in this field

662
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,759
we're not addressing this in a rational

663
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,639
thoughtful way

664
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,240
and but we can and we should and i i

665
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,159
would urge everyone in this room to

666
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,319
start thinking rationally

667
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,679
and and accept that there are different

668
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,480
ways to get to the

669
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,640
same goal and that everyone in the room

670
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,919
probably has the same goal but different

671
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,919
approaches towards that goal

672
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,399
and i just wanted to point out that ben

673
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,240
you know ben is my son

674
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,759
and i've presented him as my son but

675
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,120
he's also a brother

676
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,079
and a grandson and a nephew and i feel

677
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,479
like the debate

678
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,359
over whether or not to provide him with

679
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,480
something that would save his life

680
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,240
um the debate should no longer be about

681
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,919
whether to provide them access right the

682
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,440
debate should now be about how to

683
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,960
provide them access

684
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,519
what are the thoughtful policies that we

685
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,960
can enact so that no other family has to

686
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,558
go through what we've gone through

687
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,880
and it's not over i mean we were the

688
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,879
lucky ones we were the really lucky ones

689
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,559
there are 200 000 kids out there

690
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,360
who still don't have access to pure

691
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,359
cannabidiol

692
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:37,839
thank you

693
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,359
you
