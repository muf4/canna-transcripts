2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:17,939
all right

3
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:20,219
all cannabinoids have different

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,920
points of aerosolization

5
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,559
we'll have CBN for instance if you have

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,560
CBN in a vape they're usually using

7
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,839
gummies to help with sleep but if

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,939
they're using Vapes in a regular

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,579
cartridge usually when you're done with

10
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:40,399
50 of your cartridge the CBN is

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:44,219
completely gone completely degraded

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,020
in another effect that we've seen with

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,759
most of the cartridges on the market

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,200
because obviously we don't test just our

15
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:56,280
own is the fact that thca various other

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,739
cannabinoids actually increase in

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,920
availability in the vapor throughout the

18
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,899
lifespan of the cartridge because those

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,379
are basically the only ones left at the

20
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,359
end terpenes have a lower boiling point

21
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:10,618
and when you're using a live resin at

22
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,879
the end of the cartridge you're not

23
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:13,079
going to get a lot of that flavor you're

24
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,978
really just going to get the high that's

25
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,879
left in it interesting so you said that

26
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:22,560
CBN when the cart is at basically 50

27
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,539
it's it's all gone

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,060
on on the majority of the cards that

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,840
we've tested yes wow there is no

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,259
consistency in the in in the delivery

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,320
and mind you it's not only because of uh

32
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,540
of bad product it's also because as as

33
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,039
an industry we just haven't done a lot

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,500
of research we don't have a lot of

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,118
information on how to better preserve

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,640
these cannabinoids and these terpenes

37
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,259
and these flavonoids so we are able to

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,000
provide a consistent delivery throughout

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,799
the entire experience

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,078
so of the cannabinoids that you've

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,100
tested which one is sort of the most

42
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:01,679
consistent throughout the life of a card

43
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,478
I would say THC and CBD are the most

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,118
consistent but

45
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:08,520
the answer is a little bit cute a little

46
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,878
bit skewed um the big caveat here is

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,400
that those are the two primary

48
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:17,098
cannabinoids that are the most used so I

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,959
think as the industry progresses and as

50
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:21,479
the research progresses we're going to

51
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,479
be able to find more cannabinoids that

52
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,899
can basically provide I would say the

53
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,459
same effects but also be more consistent

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,140
in the delivery

55
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,120
right and so would that have to do with

56
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,399
kind of tweaking temperatures and and

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,620
different things like that exactly it's

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,200
really about the extraction techniques

59
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,140
the ratios the um you know we hear a lot

60
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,878
about the Entourage effect uh but what

61
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:46,919
the what we don't hear a lot about is

62
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,159
the Entourage effect of different

63
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,559
cannabinoids with different terpenes

64
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,799
also modifies the physical properties of

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,259
the the concentrate it can make it less

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,560
viscous more viscous and that has an

67
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:04,098
influence on uh on uh on on the vapor

68
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,098
that comes out

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
foreign

70
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:19,019
