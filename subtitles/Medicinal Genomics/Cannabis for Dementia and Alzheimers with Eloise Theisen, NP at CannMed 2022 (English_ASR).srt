00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,839
i'm your host ben emerald host of the

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,198
canmed coffee talk podcast and i am

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,800
joined today by eloise thiessen eloise

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,480
thanks for joining us

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
um first of all how nice is it to be

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,960
back at an in-person event

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,118
and um in your opinion what are the main

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,519
takeaways that you get from an in-person

11
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:34,238
event like cam ed well it's great to be

12
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,399
back it's so good to see people and

13
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,439
reconnect my favorite part is getting to

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,600
actually

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,878
um have in-person conversations you know

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,879
there's something

17
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,479
missing in that virtual zoom world

18
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,280
sometimes you just can't connect with

19
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,199
people the same way you can in person so

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,879
lots of opportunities to ask questions

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,960
too and

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,119
talk about our experiences in a way that

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,480
you don't get to on zoom

24
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,679
right

25
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,198
and you know it's important to bring

26
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,039
that up because we do make the

27
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,878
presentations available on our youtube

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,118
channel and in our archive which is a

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,000
great resource but but you're right it's

30
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:07,519
those

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,519
networking opportunities those

32
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,359
conversations in between the talks that

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,959
you get the real value and of course the

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,719
hugs yeah hugs are nice

35
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,478
are there any presentations at this

36
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,560
year's event in particular that you're

37
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,719
interested or looking forward to oh

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
absolutely i'm definitely looking

39
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,840
forward to hearing from dr ethan russo

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,880
i'm looking forward to hearing from

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,000
dr bonnie goldstein as well i always

42
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,000
love

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,319
hearing dr dustin sulak because you get

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,040
a lot of that clinical

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,438
implications and how they practice real

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,040
world real life experience with patients

47
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,199
that you just get to take away great

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,439
nuggets yeah and they're a big part of

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,118
our practicum as are you

50
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,039
and i was in there a little bit earlier

51
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,399
and i saw during your welcome that you

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
you asked how many people in the

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
audience this was their first experience

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,280
doing medical cannabis training and

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
there were a lot of hands that went up i

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,200
would say about two-thirds yeah so

57
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,798
that's that's really promising it is

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,960
because we need more trained physicians

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
and nurses and nurse practitioners out

60
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,799
there too absolutely yeah very important

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,878
that your healthcare team starts to

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,040
understand the value

63
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,959
and the risks the benefits of cannabis

64
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,359
because as we know our patients are

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,000
using it um there's no turning back

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,920
train has left the station

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,598
absolutely and so

68
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,280
about that so your presentation in

69
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,519
addition to your time on the practicum

70
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,640
in addition to your being a panelist on

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,519
on a panel

72
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,639
it's all about managing alzheimer's and

73
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,920
dementia symptoms with cannabis

74
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,639
first i was wondering can you speak to

75
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,878
how common these symptoms are especially

76
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,559
in assisted living communities and what

77
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,318
makes them so difficult to manage oh

78
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,120
yeah i mean the neuropsychiatric

79
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:50,159
symptoms that we see in dementia happens

80
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,560
in the later stages of dementia so you

81
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,479
know early diagnosis you you may just

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,000
start to notice memory loss but these

83
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:00,318
symptoms of agitation anxiety

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,439
aggression really start to come as their

85
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,119
memories become even you know more void

86
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,280
so that at that point they're usually

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
not even recognizing their loved ones or

88
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,878
their family members so you can tell

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,040
that they're

90
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,598
just this constant state of anxiety it's

91
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,280
actually quite heartbreaking to see

92
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,000
and we don't have any fda approved

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,919
medications to manage these symptoms so

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,479
people are either using off-label

95
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,238
medications or they're looking to you

96
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,238
know try something

97
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,878
sort of outside of the box

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,319
like cannabis right and you know i saw

99
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,840
that in your abstract as well where you

100
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,359
said that there are no fda approved

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,280
medications

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,799
that's that's surprising given how

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,280
prevalent it is and why is that the case

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,599
i you know i wish i knew i mean it's for

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
me what is really interesting is to see

106
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,839
that the medications that we do use like

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,519
antipsychotics have this black box

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
warning which means there's a higher

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,319
risk of death associated with use in

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,360
dementia patients so even what we are

111
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,679
trying to use feels like the risk is way

112
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,760
bigger than any benefit

113
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,360
i think that you know more research

114
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,120
probably goes into trying to figure out

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
how to prevent

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,438
or slow down the cognitive decline

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,239
associated with dementia but not into

118
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,319
the actual managing of the behaviors

119
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,720
interesting okay and i guess that's a

120
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,798
good segue is there an opportunity or is

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,880
there potential to use cannabis as a

122
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,959
preventative medication there's

123
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,839
definitely some preclinical data to

124
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,959
suggest that it's a

125
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,719
neuroprotectant of course it reduces

126
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,799
inflammation

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,560
there was a small study looking at it

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,879
preventing the beta amyloid plaque

129
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,439
buildup although there's some debate now

130
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,120
whether or not beta-amyloid plaques are

131
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,600
actually contributing to alzheimer's

132
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,680
disease specifically so

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,280
i would like to see more research in

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,759
that area to see

135
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,399
if it can help with the anti-aging

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,040
process that of course can contribute to

137
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,039
dementia as we age

138
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,960
excellent and i know we mentioned that

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,080
there are no fda approved medications

140
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,439
now

141
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,680
what do you think the chances are of

142
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,680
getting an fda approved cannabis

143
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,918
medication for this well what's

144
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
interesting is

145
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,839
sativex which is not approved in the

146
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,038
united states has been

147
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,198
studied

148
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,199
for the use of neuropsychiatric symptoms

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,199
in dementia patients and so i think

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,319
there's an opportunity for that

151
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,879
one-to-one cbd thc

152
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,240
oral mucosal spray to be used to manage

153
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,839
i mean the the results have been

154
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240
incredibly promising it's been helping

155
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,478
with sleep and agitation sometimes you

156
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,038
see a return to appetite you see

157
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,800
improved quality of life so i think

158
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,399
until we actually have

159
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,038
approval of something like that here in

160
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,120
the united states i mean

161
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,478
uh it's going to be a while but i hope

162
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,519
so yeah

163
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,279
no and it's great that you mentioned

164
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,599
sort of that

165
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,038
improving the quality of life aspect of

166
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
this and i know especially dealing with

167
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,159
geriatric patients like that's a that's

168
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,319
a major concern or not our major a major

169
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
goal i should say is improving that

170
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,840
quality of life and maybe speak to how

171
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,759
cannabis can help with that

172
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,198
yeah i think um it's actually the

173
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,280
conversation i love to have with the

174
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,520
family members because often when they

175
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,918
come to me they are

176
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,399
usually saying well i want to try cbd

177
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,279
for you know my

178
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,038
my mom or my dad's behaviors and you

179
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,879
know really thc

180
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,639
a lot of the data does support the thc

181
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,240
is going to be really effective and so

182
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,038
having that conversation with them

183
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,800
because they're a little scared of thc

184
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,800
about what does euphoria look like for

185
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,160
them you know so letting them know that

186
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,919
you know well maybe your dad's gonna

187
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,680
smile again

188
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,240
you know you might laugh at things find

189
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,240
things funny again and you know usually

190
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,879
they go you know that'd be really nice

191
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,680
to see my dad happy again he's but it's

192
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,000
very um anxiety producing for the family

193
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,840
members and caregivers to see how

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
distressed their loved one is so it

195
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,799
really does have this like positive

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,279
domino effect to just see them

197
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,680
making jokes again or engaging in

198
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,719
conversation the best they can

199
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,959
and now are you finding those

200
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,759
conversations are becoming easier to

201
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,198
have where you know seniors or families

202
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,520
are becoming more receptive to using

203
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,280
cannabis just because you know

204
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,959
whether it's the anecdotal evidence or

205
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,439
the actual evidence that's been coming

206
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,839
out seems to support it it does and it

207
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,560
also helps when in the assisted living

208
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,598
communities i have a lot of um champions

209
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,399
there both staff caregivers

210
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,038
other

211
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,279
families who have been you know having

212
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,918
their loved ones use it so you get a lot

213
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,519
of community support around it

214
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,399
and acceptance which has been really

215
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,000
nice and you know sometimes i have

216
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,318
patients who have such great success

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,839
that their spouse will actually go up to

218
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,598
the other family member and say let me

219
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,119
tell you a little secret i got my wife

220
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,759
on these gummies you know you should

221
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,000
consider it

222
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,479
absolutely and one thing i wanted to ask

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,519
you too is you know there's a growing

224
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:58,159
interest in psilocybin or psychedelic

225
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,839
mushrooms and you know even us at

226
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,599
medicinal genomics we're beginning to

227
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,198
explore that and see how we can sort of

228
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:07,279
help um move that along um

229
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,919
i'm curious is there any sort of

230
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,638
evidence or potential for using

231
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,478
psilocybin to help with these conditions

232
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,960
yeah i mean specifically in the

233
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,800
neuropsychiatric symptoms no but i think

234
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,598
there's great opportunity there you know

235
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,439
it's

236
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,439
you know with looking at you know

237
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,519
palliative care you know when people are

238
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,879
diagnosed with a terminal illness but

239
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,560
maybe they're going to live for years

240
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,280
like with dementia and alzheimer's

241
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,599
disease i think we really have a missed

242
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,439
opportunity of how do we help these

243
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,959
people still enjoy life you know where's

244
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,479
the pleasure for them whether that's

245
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,079
with you know psychedelics and

246
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,080
psilocybin or cannabinoids and euphoria

247
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,720
listening to music again you know having

248
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,639
those pleasurable moments i think

249
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,800
there's great opportunity and and we

250
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,639
know that we're seeing

251
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,319
psilocybin helpful for things like

252
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,720
mental health challenges and pain so i i

253
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,480
know there's there's room for it people

254
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,360
want to feel good right yeah there's

255
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,200
nothing wrong with it at all absolutely

256
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
okay so in wrapping up here i did want

257
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,320
to get your thoughts that you know given

258
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,799
that so much of the research that's

259
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,080
being done into medical cannabis is

260
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,679
being done by

261
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,680
private companies in a lot of ways just

262
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,599
because of the you know the realities of

263
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,439
prohibition how important is it for

264
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,839
those companies to come to events like

265
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,800
canmed and share those insights so that

266
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,040
you know

267
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,639
the the whole community community can

268
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,919
kind of benefit from that and we can

269
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,919
help these patients

270
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,759
oh yeah i think it's essential i mean

271
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,919
you know we need to be listening to each

272
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,838
other uh in terms of what everybody's

273
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,679
doing and you know again figuring out

274
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,160
how do we come together as a community

275
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,679
to to really help these patients

276
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,240
there's different unique perspectives

277
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,639
that people have that you may not really

278
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
again understand

279
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,639
unless you're coming to these events

280
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,560
networking having an opportunity to ask

281
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,319
these questions that you know maybe you

282
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,879
didn't even think of until you're in the

283
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,240
moment with those people and um

284
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,559
so i would really love to see the

285
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,240
industry come together more

286
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,119
absolutely yeah and it's great you

287
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
mentioned that the different

288
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
perspectives and that's one of the

289
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,480
things we like to focus on at canmed we

290
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,040
have the the wonderful healthcare

291
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,879
providers like you and bonnie and dustin

292
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,679
um but then we bring in the cultivators

293
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,159
and the lab safety testing and

294
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,759
everybody so so it there's so much to

295
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,439
learn when it comes to cannabis i can

296
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,919
see why it's intimidating for some

297
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,200
healthcare professionals because i never

298
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,759
understood the value of um

299
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,000
you know learning more about botany

300
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,879
but that has been eye-opening for me as

301
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,679
a clinician and the lab testing

302
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,039
um and the cultivation all of that i

303
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,120
couldn't do what i do unless i

304
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,958
understood all of those components

305
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,879
excellent we and we couldn't do what we

306
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,679
do without people like you so thank you

307
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,838
very much thank you for joining us and

308
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,479
thank you to our sponsors medicine women

309
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,640
