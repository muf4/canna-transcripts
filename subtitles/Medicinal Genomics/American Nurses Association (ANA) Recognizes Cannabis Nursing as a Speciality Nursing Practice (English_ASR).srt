2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:21,399
and now I know just just this last fall

3
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:23,759
the Ana officially recognized cannabis

4
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:24,719
nursing as a specialty so how important

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,400
was

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:31,399
that I think that this is I don't think

7
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,960
we have yet come to terms with like the

8
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,679
the gravity of that because what that

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,640
means this is the first you know healthc

10
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:44,960
Care Organization Association that has

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,159
recognized you know cannabis as the

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,878
medicine that it is so that means that

13
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,078
it that we could just start treating

14
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:55,679
cannabis as the real medicine that it is

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,239
you know the the the medical the the

16
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,119
physicians organization the pharmacist

17
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,640
organizations they haven't come out and

18
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,719
named their own Specialties yet in

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,040
cannabis and nursing is the first one to

20
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:11,478
do that so that means that we're well on

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,400
our way to treating and recognize

22
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:19,799
recognizing cannabis as as a true

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,240
therapeutic so and I'm sure you're you

24
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,960
there has to be a little bit of Pride

25
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,959
there that your that your profession was

26
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,759
the first to recognize that absolutely

27
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,599
yeah yeah it's really exciting and you

28
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,959
know nursing is going on 20 I think it's

29
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,759
20 plus years of being the most trusted

30
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,919
profession in the country so the fact

31
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,640
that nurses are cannabis nurses are

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,200
being officially recognized is really

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,079
huge and I think that more that means

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,560
that more people who are scared to try

35
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,399
cannabis are going to find that that

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,280
hand to hold them in a nurse and guide

37
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,200
them right because trust really is

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,599
important with cannabis medicine because

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,799
it's uh it's a bit of a journey and

40
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,478
there's trial and error and and there's

41
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,520
U some experiment experimentation that

42
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:11,318
goes on so that trust is very important

43
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,318
yeah for sure excellent

44
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,659
[Music]

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,680
