1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,839
hello everyone thank you very much

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,278
um

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,120
so

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,280
making cbd a drug

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,439
that's what i was going to talk about in

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,518
2020 and i'm really sorry to do the bait

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,480
and switch on you we were really looking

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,399
forward to do that project but um

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,000
a few things came up

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,000
and uh this is what we're going to be

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,118
talking about today

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so

13
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,000
uh

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,839
yeah 2022.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,198
thank

16
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,000
goodness um

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,480
so

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,079
first about who we are um we're

19
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,599
deliclabs um we're a contract research

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,520
organization

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,800
we

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,359
prize collaboration with everyone we can

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,119
we we want to try and bring as much of

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,479
the scientific method as possible to

25
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:55,919
counters we want to try and make

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:58,078
information more widely available

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,079
we do a lot of collaboration with the

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,239
university of british columbia we're

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,640
actually based

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,319
on campus-ish

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,519
so we've got access to a lot of

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,438
instrumentation that a regular lab just

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,719
simply cannot afford

34
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,478
through our industry collaborations

35
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,640
but we also like to do a lot of

36
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,280
collaborations with other people in the

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,640
cannabis space

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,920
moniker and linda two examples of that

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,599
so our research topics are

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
chemistry we're we're a bunch of

41
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,839
chemistry nerds who who that's

42
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,118
that's what makes us happy that's what

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,719
we do

44
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,478
um

45
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,319
i'm the

46
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,719
uh

47
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,199
my background is computational medicinal

48
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,478
chemistry so drug design and molecular

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
modeling

50
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,039
and i'm sort of on board as data and

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,680
that that side of things

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,840
the rest of them are very interested in

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,040
organic synthetic chemistry analytical

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
chemistry

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,320
uh and those sorts of things

56
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,959
um

57
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,438
what we work on is anything that is a

58
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,679
biomolecule and is regulated that's

59
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,399
that's what gets us off

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,399
so

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,280
we're lucky enough in canada that we

62
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:17,280
have what's called a section

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,759
45 54. oh god my dyslexia is kicking in

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,759
i think it's section 54

65
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,560
which is an exemption to do psychedelic

66
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,479
research so we can work with a whole

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,959
range of interesting biomolecules we're

68
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,318
doing some dmt stuff some psilocybins

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,640
some solution

70
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,079
and those sorts of things

71
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,000
but today i'm going to talk about a

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,080
client project we did

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,560
our client

74
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,319
unfortunately i can't talk as much about

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
this as i would like to

76
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,119
i can say our client was a multinational

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,120
we were trying to develop an enhanced

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,599
cbd vape

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,759
and what they engaged us to do was a

80
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,959
virtual ligand screening so we're

81
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,158
screening

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,800
potential molecules

83
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,840
in computer simulations

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,159
to try and reduce their in silica sorry

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,319
they're in vitro and they're in vivo

86
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,359
load

87
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,439
so

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,599
again i really wish i could talk more

89
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,560
about this but i really

90
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,639
can't

91
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,400
all i can say is that we were looking

92
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,119
for terpenes

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,920
that are expressed in cannabis and we're

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,519
looking for agonism at the gabarae

95
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,439
receptor

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,519
and we're looking for cns gaba

97
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,719
so the medics can probably have a little

98
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,439
bit of a guess

99
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,519
what we might be trying to do there

100
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,120
so first i want to talk about virtual

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,200
screening so

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,120
this is the process that you would go

103
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,280
through to determine how you're going to

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,519
do your virtual screens so the first

105
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,519
question is what do you know about the

106
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
protein of interest do you have any

107
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,759
structural information do you just have

108
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,238
a sequence

109
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,919
in our case we actually had some protein

110
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
structural information there are crystal

111
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,158
structures of the gaba receptor

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
so that means we can

113
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,280
go along and do some docking which is

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,920
just in silico placing ligands on the

115
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,560
protein and seeing where they interact

116
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,119
um and then from there that may even

117
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
answer some of your questions

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,639
and there are

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,639
other routes you can go after that which

120
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,639
i'll take you through as we go

121
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,319
so

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
what was the plan well the first step

123
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,240
was to have a look at the existing

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,399
crystal structures um

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,879
see where the current molecules were

126
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:39,918
interacting seeing how we could um

127
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,800
see see if we can find out how a terpene

128
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,120
might bind in those same pockets

129
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,280
compare any of the ligands and to those

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
native crystal structures and then let's

131
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,918
just see if we can jam some ligands in

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,840
there and see if they're happy

133
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,599
i should point out

134
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,679
ligands in this case really just means

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,840
small molecule

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,800
it's a throwback to inorganic chemistry

137
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,279
where you're chelating to a to a metal

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,079
um the inorganic chemists hate us

139
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,839
molecular models using this but

140
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,839
at least we don't call them like ants

141
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,360
so a little bit about gaba

142
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,759
um the receptor the iron channel um the

143
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,720
endogenous ligand is gaba amino butyric

144
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
acid it's a really common um

145
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,039
neuro

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,759
signal

147
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,959
um it's found throughout the body um

148
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,759
there are multiple subtypes um

149
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,439
each comprised uh each of the subunits

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,000
have different types and then the the

151
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,759
subtypes are comprised of different

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,800
different versions

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,080
i'll give you a little idea it's quite a

154
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
complex

155
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,399
protein structure so there are these

156
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,719
five protein subunits

157
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,279
that are all come together to make a

158
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
transmembrane pore

159
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,559
it's

160
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,599
it's an ion channel so what it does is

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,319
it depolarizes synapses

162
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,280
which is an inhibitory mechanism it

163
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,039
calms you down a little bit

164
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,959
the important thing is this picture down

165
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,639
the bottom uh what you see here is that

166
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,198
there are two gaba sites and there is

167
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,120
another one there that is labeled the

168
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,639
benzodiazepine site so that was the site

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,879
that we were targeting that's where we

170
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,879
wanted to interact um and it's been

171
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,759
shown that it sort of acts as an

172
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,000
allosteric modulator so it doesn't

173
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,919
make the channel turn on um by

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,279
stimulating that side at all but it does

175
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:34,560
potentiate um gaba's effect

176
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,079
on that receptor

177
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,399
and the other thing to note is that all

178
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,719
of these sites are at the interface of

179
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,560
the two proteins so you really need to

180
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,479
be studying the complex as a whole you

181
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,478
can't just look at one of the sub units

182
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,280
right so now

183
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,119
i went on and did some literature

184
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,519
research before i jumped into the

185
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,519
project um and what we found is that

186
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,758
there is limited evidence of terpenes

187
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,240
interacting with gaba and having an

188
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,720
agonist effect which is pretty cool so

189
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,439
there's some good news at the beginning

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
and there's a whole lot of

191
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,279
pharmaceuticals that are well known to

192
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,279
interact with gaba so great awesome

193
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,959
there's some crystal structures out

194
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,038
there

195
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,038
what i found very quickly is that the

196
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:23,199
quality of those crystal structures

197
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:25,439
varies hugely um because gaba is such a

198
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
complicated protein

199
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,800
and it's membrane bound

200
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,120
the only way you can really get it to

201
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
crystallize well is by using some pretty

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
unrepresentative physiological

203
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,120
conditions you end up throwing a lot of

204
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,439
detergent in there to get it to actually

205
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,079
crystallize and what that means is the

206
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,399
conformations get distorted

207
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,800
and you end up with a structure that's

208
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,000
not particularly representative um

209
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,598
classically it's down in the

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,598
transmembrane domain that they they

211
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,159
actually collapse on the core and you

212
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,000
get some rotations and some twists

213
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
um

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,959
that turned out to be a little bit of a

215
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,800
problem

216
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,439
i'll get to that later

217
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,319
but the gist is that it's thought that

218
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,319
cbd does activate gaba and we were

219
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,160
interested in looking at cbd at cabra as

220
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,479
well but it's thought that gaba doesn't

221
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,039
actually sorry cbd doesn't actually bind

222
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,038
at the benzodiazepine site it binds down

223
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,360
in the transmembrane domain

224
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,399
on a cleft on those those proteins down

225
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,080
there

226
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,000
and

227
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,000
since that area is heavily distorted in

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,879
the crystal structures it makes it much

229
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,879
harder to model

230
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,038
so up here we're looking at the

231
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,399
benzodiazepine site here so

232
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,918
so we've got the two different crystal

233
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,679
structures here we have 6 huo and

234
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,399
6d t5 i believe

235
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,399
in

236
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,639
green you can see the 6d

237
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,559
6d65 structure and where i've got that

238
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,720
red arrow i'm showing that the two

239
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,838
structures are quite distorted

240
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,440
in comparison the the white ribbon

241
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,800
basically means it's forming a beta

242
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,680
sheet that's the sort of structure

243
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,159
you're expecting the green wiggly lines

244
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,559
represent loop structures which are

245
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,600
normal in a protein you do expect to see

246
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,000
loops

247
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,320
you just don't expect to see them there

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,320
so what that's showing is that in the

249
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,200
process of crystallizing that structure

250
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,200
has been distorted

251
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
right so

252
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
on to the in vitro data

253
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,519
so

254
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,479
like i said you know people use

255
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,919
benzodiazepines they know they work

256
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,278
that's awesome great

257
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,919
yay

258
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,159
um however most of those were developed

259
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,000
a long long long time ago and what they

260
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,519
did is they just stuck them in humans

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,639
until they saw it working and they went

262
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,639
great it's the dose

263
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,399
there's not easy to

264
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,800
find out how strongly a compound binds

265
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:54,559
to gaba alone you can't really

266
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,559
just isolate gaba stick a molecule on it

267
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,399
find out what concentration it is

268
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,239
actually binding at

269
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,320
most of these assays are done through

270
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
patch clamps which is where you express

271
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,440
the

272
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,160
receptor in i believe it's a frog ovary

273
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
and then you run a voltage across it

274
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,278
and then you're looking for the calcium

275
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,039
transmission so what you're actually

276
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,720
doing is a functional assay you're not

277
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,799
really doing a binding assay you're not

278
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,320
really seeing because you can't do a

279
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:25,039
classic washout assay here

280
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,680
um so i draw the literature and i found

281
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,000
a whole range of different various

282
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,639
values i didn't find any binding data at

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,278
all i found some ic50 data which was

284
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,600
confusing because it's not inhibitory so

285
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,439
i don't know why it was labeled

286
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,680
ic50

287
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,279
i found some ec50 which is what i was

288
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,759
expecting however the numbers i'm

289
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,480
showing here are averages and they

290
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,439
differed by orders of magnitude

291
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,680
so

292
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,360
that was a problem

293
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,439
but uh you know we're brave we're going

294
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,720
to push on anyway

295
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,480
because they're paying us so we're going

296
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,879
to do it

297
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,920
so um i thought right well the first

298
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,519
thing to do is we know lindelof works so

299
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,759
let's dock linalool

300
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,399
and um sure enough that's actually the

301
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,559
gaba site and linoleum in green lies

302
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,799
beautifully on top of gaba it just sits

303
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,278
there and it was like great okay

304
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,439
so it binds to gaba and then it bound to

305
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,360
the benzodiazepine site and it bound to

306
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,680
about 15 different other sites so it's

307
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,919
like oh docking right so i can stick

308
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,639
i can select anywhere on the protein and

309
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,479
i can dock a little to it i was like oh

310
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,759
dear so this isn't going to be selective

311
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,159
so

312
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,600
how do we actually indicate what's

313
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,039
working and what's not

314
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,560
so we thought right

315
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,958
what we really need is some binding

316
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,679
energy calculations so this is a way of

317
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,679
calculating how strongly it's docking to

318
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,439
a particular spot like does it actually

319
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,838
want to be there

320
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,079
um and the basic gist is that there is a

321
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,639
state function between

322
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,638
freely floating ligands

323
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,399
and the protein and then they go through

324
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,600
a transition state and then they

325
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,120
collapse down into their bound

326
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
conformations they both adapt their

327
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,799
conformations a little bit their lower

328
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,480
energies change

329
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:12,159
and if you have a favorable binding

330
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,159
you'll have a total drop in energy

331
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,000
so this is molecular mechanics and

332
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,839
generalized born surface area

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,839
approximations

334
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,000
that's not particularly important all

335
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,160
i'm here is to say is that there is a

336
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,639
way of calculating this you can you can

337
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,838
do it with a computational simulation

338
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
um

339
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,399
it does neglect entropy which is an

340
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,959
important part of that equation i showed

341
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,958
you earlier

342
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
the justification is that usually you

343
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,278
use a cogeneric set of ligands so a

344
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,039
whole ligands that look like each other

345
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,559
they've just got small variations in

346
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,399
functional groups

347
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,559
and you can assume that they all have

348
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,159
similar entropies so you can cancel that

349
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,159
term out across a series

350
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,320
i was testing a broad range of terpenes

351
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,679
which are not cogeneric

352
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,760
so that assumption was a little

353
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,159
questionable

354
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,159
um so we did the work anyway because

355
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,919
you've got to see how it's working and

356
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,679
these are just the control compounds so

357
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,759
these are just the pharmaceutical

358
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,879
compounds that we have some estimates of

359
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,240
their binding energy predictions

360
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,559
and what you can see in the molecular

361
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,680
dynamics is i actually have a negative

362
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,359
trend

363
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,120
so i have negative correlation to the

364
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,639
binding energies which is not a great

365
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,519
sign

366
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,360
the docking energies are so varied that

367
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,839
while i do have a positive correlation

368
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,600
it's not great

369
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,480
in fact if you look at the r values

370
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,639
they're basically random so that's not

371
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,920
much use

372
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,919
right what's next

373
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,720
the the i can still remember my my

374
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,919
chemistry lecture explaining this one to

375
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,920
me and and yeah all of those assumptions

376
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,479
were just garbage

377
00:13:53,919 --> 00:14:00,399
so we needed to find

378
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,399
a new way of tackling this problem

379
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,600
um

380
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,439
docking scores docking scores are used

381
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,959
to

382
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,800
uh

383
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,879
weight the confirmations that the

384
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,039
molecules are

385
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,360
adapting and and see which ones are

386
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,198
favored it's a really good way of

387
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,959
showing what the most probable

388
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,240
confirmation is

389
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,759
if you know the binding site

390
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,839
but they're not very good for comparing

391
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,958
between molecules usually they're

392
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,199
additive

393
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,278
so if a molecule has more atoms it will

394
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,359
get a higher score

395
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,198
but there are ways you can gain that

396
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,278
system

397
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,359
ensemble docking is one of those ways

398
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,278
and that's where if

399
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,199
i think it's the next slide okay it's

400
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,120
the next next slide

401
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,479
but the general gist is that you dock to

402
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,720
a whole lot of different protein

403
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,199
confirmations you doctor the same site

404
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,600
and what you're looking for is

405
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,240
how does the binding score change as you

406
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,480
change the protein conformation

407
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,440
what you'd really be hoping for is that

408
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,519
a ligand has the ability to adopt adopt

409
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,560
different confirmations to adapt to the

410
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,078
change in the binding site so

411
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,518
one of the problems that we always have

412
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,359
is we get presented with these beautiful

413
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,679
crystal structures which is this lovely

414
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,959
static model but the reality is they're

415
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,399
under brownie emotion they're all

416
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,879
vibrating they're all moving a little

417
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,039
bit so that conformation is adapting so

418
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,039
if you have a molecule that is

419
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,599
incredibly rigid

420
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,759
then it needs to have a massive energy

421
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,839
bonus to really stabilize that

422
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,680
conformation

423
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,440
there are times when you maybe you want

424
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,958
an actually a flexible ligand so it can

425
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
adapt to a whole range of protein

426
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,439
conformations

427
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,680
but what you're really looking for there

428
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,519
is that you get a nice constant score so

429
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,039
that even though the ligand is changing

430
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,560
confirmation that the docking score

431
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,958
stays consistent you don't want to see a

432
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,278
wide range in docking scores

433
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,638
for different protein confirmations

434
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,480
so here are three example um protein

435
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,480
conformations so these are taken from a

436
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,079
molecular dynamics simulation which is

437
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,800
where you you're allowing

438
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,519
newtonian forces to act on the protein

439
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,838
and it's vibrating away you raise it to

440
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,799
a normal temperature you give it

441
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,560
natural motion

442
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,039
and what you do is you take a series of

443
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,719
snapshots through that trajectory and

444
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,559
you get different protein confirmations

445
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,199
then you dock back into them so what

446
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,958
i've highlighted here is three areas

447
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,120
where that protein which is close to the

448
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,559
leg and the ligand is in the

449
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,440
the the thicker

450
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,879
um

451
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,480
sticks and

452
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,720
what you're seeing there is the amino

453
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,480
acid residues in in the finer sticks

454
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
in in green you have the cartoon

455
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,399
representation which is sort of the the

456
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,320
secondary structure of the protein and

457
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,759
what i'm highlighting here is the

458
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,600
changes that we are seeing in that

459
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,000
secondary structure which is derived

460
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,759
from the changes in the confirmation of

461
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,958
of those residues

462
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,240
and how that has changed through those

463
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:01,119
snapshots so what i ended up using was

464
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,519
uh 10 snapshots from different

465
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,400
simulations which were

466
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,318
the lowest binding energy of the ligand

467
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,759
in that simulation

468
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,879
um

469
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,318
and i used it for all of the the

470
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,799
pharmaceutical compounds all of the

471
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:20,558
benzodiazepine simulations that i'd run

472
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:22,240
so i ended up docking into 40 different

473
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:23,279
protein confirmations

474
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,439
which

475
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,480
i'm going to show you here

476
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,360
so

477
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,558
what we managed to do was from a panel

478
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,000
of 200 odd terpenes that are known to be

479
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,160
expressed in cannabis and found in

480
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,599
cannabis um

481
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
we found

482
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,119
some compounds that were better in

483
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,600
silico

484
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,479
than lineal

485
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,079
this project is still undergoing work by

486
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,319
our partner

487
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:53,359
they have completed the in vitro testing

488
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:56,079
and i believe the in vivo testing was

489
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:59,038
scheduled to start

490
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:01,279
at the end of last year so

491
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:04,640
it is quite possible that this

492
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,519
product will be on the market soon

493
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,360
with

494
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,879
unfortunately again

495
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,479
i can't say

496
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,240
which terpenes i'm very sorry about that

497
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,038
um

498
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,319
i'd like to thank the team um this this

499
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,759
is uh our founders um and the rest of

500
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,038
the team who helped throughout the rest

501
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,720
of this project

502
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,400
um i'd like to thank you all very much

503
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,120
for your attention and um

504
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
have a great day

505
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,519
any any any questions

506
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,599
to where

507
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,479
oh it's going to be in a vape so it's

508
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,200
going to be inhalation so it'll go

509
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,640
straight into the bloodstream i have no

510
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,840
concerns about the

511
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,840
bioavailability of them

512
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,839
um

513
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,900
i

514
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,000
[Music]

515
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,120
[Applause]

516
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,919
i don't think any of them are going to

517
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,798
be

518
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,640
drugs of their own right i don't think

519
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,759
they're that potent

520
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,240
i don't think we're looking at

521
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,679
benzodiazepine replacements for instance

522
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,480
um but i do think

523
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,240
there is some value in giving

524
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,038
gaba a little bit of a nudge while

525
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,200
you're also delivering cbd i think that

526
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,200
happens naturally um

527
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,960
with some of the other terpenes that are

528
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,240
you know naturally expressed

529
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,480
but what i would say is that some of

530
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,000
those terpenes identified in the 35 are

531
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,279
very very minor terpenes in um

532
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,359
cannabis and what i expect is that there

533
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,279
will be an artificially high level of

534
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,959
these terpenes delivered in this cbd

535
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,839
product

536
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,400
so we're enhancing what you could call i

537
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,439
suppose the entourage effect i

538
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,919
i'm

539
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,240
not a huge

540
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,240
fan of that i think it is a

541
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,479
i don't think you need to put

542
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,199
the 800 900 compounds found in cannabis

543
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,120
all into one particular formulation but

544
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
i think there are definitely

545
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,798
minor components that you could amp up

546
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,600
the concentration of and make a really

547
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,599
wonderful product from

548
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,769
thank you

549
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,769
