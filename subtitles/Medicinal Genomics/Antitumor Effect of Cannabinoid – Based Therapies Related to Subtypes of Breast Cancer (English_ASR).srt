1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:13,010
thank you thank you very much and well

2
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:15,769
I'm gonna use my 15 minutes wisely I'm

3
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:19,160
gonna skip the CV part and I'm gonna go

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:22,699
straight to the data I am gonna present

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,278
the most recent research we have done in

6
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:29,089
the lab on the anti-tumor effects of

7
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:31,519
cannabinoids and we have been doing this

8
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:34,100
for 20 years already and it's pretty

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,808
clear to us not only for the research

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,189
that we have done in our lab but from

11
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:39,019
the research that other groups all over

12
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:41,359
the world have been doing during this

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,840
time that Cannavino it haven't eaten

14
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,969
more properties and they can produce

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,050
this effect by targeting different

16
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:54,649
stages of the disease they can sorry

17
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:56,828
they can kill cancer cells as it was

18
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,810
mentioned before they can also block the

19
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,820
feeding of the new to Merle masses a

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,070
process that we call angiogenesis and

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,829
they can also block the generation of

22
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,019
metastases but the truth is that the

23
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:11,329
vast majority of these studies have been

24
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:12,589
conducted with pure cannabinoids

25
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:14,719
not because we think this is the best

26
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,180
therapeutic approach but because we

27
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,129
wanted to understand what was going on

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:24,590
inside the cancer cells to understand

29
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:26,839
how can have you know it's work so it is

30
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,180
pretty obvious also and I don't think I

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,060
have to give you an extra explanation

32
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,840
today that the cannabis plant is a very

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:39,710
complex and sophisticated Factory and it

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,740
produces not only THC and CBD but a lot

35
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:45,289
of other cannabinoids and a lot of other

36
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:49,039
chemical compounds that have a very

37
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:52,549
interesting therapeutic potential for

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,990
example among the cannabinoids there are

39
00:01:52,549 --> 00:02:00,860
more than 140 different entities and

40
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:03,438
some of them have very interesting

41
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:05,900
potential therapeutic applications some

42
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,538
have sorry

43
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,879
some have anti poor effective actions in

44
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:14,598
cancer cells groans groaning cultures

45
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,239
and the key issue here is that most of

46
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:18,789
them have not been studied

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,350
yeah and the same thing happens with

48
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:24,879
terpenes we know that some of them have

49
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:27,280
interesting therapeutic applications and

50
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,650
I highly recommend you to read the work

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,560
that Ethan Russo has published in these

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,420
regards and again most of these

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,340
compounds and we are talking about more

54
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:39,280
than 100 compounds weighing more than

55
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,330
100 compounds have not been studied and

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,610
studied yet and as did he mention before

57
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,590
when we talk about cannabis and about

58
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,870
other plants but can I was in particular

59
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,360
we have to keep in mind what we call in

60
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,750
pharmacology the synergistic effect or

61
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,060
what we call in this auditorium the

62
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,210
entourage effect which means that one

63
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,599
plus one is way more than two so with

64
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:07,290
all these things in mind the question we

65
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:10,569
try to address in this specific project

66
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:13,719
was if it was a better therapeutic

67
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:17,650
approach to use pure cannabinoids THC

68
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:19,900
CBD or whole plant preparations and to

69
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,240
answer this question we established a

70
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,080
collaboration with this company here

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:29,620
self therapeutics based in Australia and

72
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:34,150
we aimed at comparing the anti-tumor

73
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:38,140
effect of pure THC provided by THC farm

74
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:41,409
with that of a THC rich extract provided

75
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:44,709
by Unseld and non-profit mutual benefit

76
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:47,259
corporation based in California so we

77
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,360
have the analysis of a number of

78
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:51,099
cannabinoids not all of them but a

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,380
number of cannabinoids in the

80
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,449
preparation a number of turbines in the

81
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:56,979
preparation and because we wanted to be

82
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:01,269
sure that we were comparing the same

83
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:04,479
amount of THC in here and in here we did

84
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,689
not one lab test but three in different

85
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:11,159
facilities one in in the United States

86
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:15,579
and two in Spain and to corroborate this

87
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,769
information this data so we did this

88
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,989
experiments in different models of

89
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,659
breast cancer and my group is working on

90
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:24,849
breast cancer now and regarding this

91
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,580
pathology we use the same term breast

92
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,470
cancer to define pathologies that have

93
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:30,959
nothing to do we

94
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,070
one to each other in terms of molecular

95
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:37,919
markers markers treatments prognosis etc

96
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:39,569
so when doctors have to choose a

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,390
specific treatment for a breast cancer

98
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:44,849
patient they check for specific markers

99
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:47,789
and depending on these markers they sub

100
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:53,700
classify breast cancer in three subtypes

101
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:55,680
the first one is it's called hormone

102
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,170
sensitive because these cancer cells

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,050
Express estrogen receptors or

104
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:04,080
progesterone receptors and since the

105
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:07,170
stroke genic signaling is exacerbated

106
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,329
the aim of these therapies is to shut

107
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,759
down this signaling and we can do that

108
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:14,879
by different approaches we can remove

109
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,339
the endogenous source of estrogens by

110
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,219
removing the ovaries or we can use drugs

111
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,229
to interfere with this signaling and one

112
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,230
of them for example is I'm sure you have

113
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,410
heard about it is tamoxifen the second

114
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,650
type of breast tumors is called her2

115
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,840
positive because these cancer cells

116
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:37,489
express abnormally high levels of this

117
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:40,439
protein called Hertz what do the doctors

118
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,350
recommend to these patients well drugs

119
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,870
that specifically target this protein

120
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,000
this head to receptor trastuzumab

121
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,550
petaluma the names are irrelevant at

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,699
this point and there is a third entity

123
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,310
which is called triple negative and the

124
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,899
name is self-explanatory it's called

125
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,629
triple negative because these cancer

126
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:03,269
cells do not express estrogen receptors

127
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:06,360
or progesterone receptors or head to

128
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:08,029
receptors and unfortunately this is the

129
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,139
most aggressive phenotype and

130
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:12,478
unfortunately since there are no

131
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,000
specific markers there are no specific

132
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,500
drugs that we can use for these patients

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,478
and they have to receive a standard

134
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,360
chemotherapy that you will know that is

135
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,329
extremely aggressive

136
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,990
well we tried to answer the question I

137
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:29,639
mentioned before in the different

138
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:33,329
subtypes of breast cancer and we started

139
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:36,839
with the hormone sensitive and what we

140
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:40,949
did was to grow these cancer cells a

141
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,359
cell line that is called t47 d in in

142
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,218
this

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,129
petri dishes that did I showed you and

144
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:49,550
we challenged these cells with

145
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:53,360
increasing concentrations of THC THC

146
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:58,250
that came either from THC farm in other

147
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:01,189
words pure THC or from the botanical

148
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,860
drug extract from the whole plant

149
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:06,289
extract and as you can see and here what

150
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,530
we represent is cell viability is the

151
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:11,899
percentage of cells that remain alive in

152
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:15,378
the cell cultures and as you can see as

153
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:17,508
we increase the HC concentration these

154
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:20,419
dots go down in other words we are

155
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:24,098
killing the cancer cells and as you can

156
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:26,568
also see very easily in this graph the

157
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:29,060
tea the pure THC produces this

158
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:32,449
antitumoral action but the extract is

159
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,550
more potent than the pure cannabinoid in

160
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:37,788
order to see if this was an effect that

161
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:41,658
was exclusive exclusive exclusively

162
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:45,949
produced in this cell line or it was

163
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:48,500
more general and a hormone sensitive

164
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:49,939
breast cancer cells in general we

165
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,338
performed the second in the same

166
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:56,478
experiment in a second hormone sensitive

167
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:58,699
breast cancer cell line mcf7 and the

168
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:02,959
effect was exactly the same both

169
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:05,330
pooty-poo THC and the extract decreased

170
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,418
the viability of these cancer cells and

171
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:12,348
again the extract was more potent than

172
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:14,359
the pure compound we then moved to the

173
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:16,759
second subtype of breast cancer her2

174
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,120
positive and perform exactly the same

175
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:23,379
experiments and the response was exactly

176
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,418
the same both THC and the extract

177
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:30,319
decreased the viability of these cancer

178
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:33,078
cells in culture and again the extract

179
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,649
the purple line was more potent in doing

180
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:38,028
that than the pure cannabinoid and

181
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,828
finally we did these experiments in the

182
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:41,778
triple negative breast cancer cells and

183
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:44,088
I want to remind you that this is a very

184
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:46,370
aggressive subtype of breast cancer with

185
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:50,930
no targeted therapies yet

186
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:53,089
and we observed that these cancer cells

187
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,019
are also sensitive to cannabinoid

188
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:57,150
treatment both the buccal

189
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,129
in green and the extract in purple

190
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,500
decreased the viability of the two cell

191
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:02,850
lines of this subtype that we studied

192
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,970
and again

193
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:10,259
the botanical drug extract was more

194
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,790
potent than the pure compound so from

195
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:14,189
this part that take-home message is that

196
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:16,199
all breast cancer subtypes are sensitive

197
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,990
to cannabinoid antiproliferative action

198
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:23,430
and that the extract is more potent than

199
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:25,830
the pure compound so we next tried to do

200
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:30,389
something similar to what it is doing we

201
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:32,850
try to combine pure THC with the most

202
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:35,039
prominent most abundant terpenes in the

203
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,009
extract just to see if we could recreate

204
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,949
the effect of the whole plant extract

205
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:45,870
whole plant preparation by combining THC

206
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:47,400
which a bunch of other compounds and we

207
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,590
did that in the three subtypes of breast

208
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,259
cancer and I'm gonna guide you through

209
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:55,620
the graphs we represent here against

210
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,960
cell viability in percentage so this is

211
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,110
the amount of cells that we mean alive

212
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:04,080
again in the in the dishes and we want

213
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:07,169
this Bart bars to go as down as possible

214
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,080
and in the white bars you have the

215
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:11,370
control cells that says that the cells

216
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,889
that do not receive any kind of

217
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:19,679
treatment and in this line bar what you

218
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:21,899
see is the effect that the terpenes only

219
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,809
the five tapings produce on cell

220
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,299
viability which is none just using the

221
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,909
five connector pins you do not decrease

222
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:33,569
the viability you do not kill the cancer

223
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:36,899
cells what happens if we combine THC

224
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:39,870
with it with this terpene cocktail well

225
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,329
the effect is this one and if you

226
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,700
compare this bar with this one which is

227
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,759
the effect that the THC alone produces

228
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,670
it's very easy to see that combining THC

229
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,580
with a called trapping cocktail does not

230
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:57,120
increase the anti-cancer effect of a

231
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,520
pure compound we obtain exactly the same

232
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,549
effects in the other two subtypes this

233
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,100
is the effect of the terpenes alone in

234
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:07,349
these social lines this is the effect of

235
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,960
THC in the her2 positive this is the

236
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,269
effect of

237
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,690
the THC in the triple negative and when

238
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:18,179
we add the terpenes to the THC we cannot

239
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:22,240
improve the anti-tumor effect of the ATS

240
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:24,699
so combination of THC with these five

241
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,549
specific terpenes do not does not

242
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:33,339
recreate the effect of the potency of

243
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:35,708
THC so what about in vivo effect because

244
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:37,720
a lot of things work in vitro and we can

245
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:41,229
draw some conclusions for from in vitro

246
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,209
studies but we if we really want to sell

247
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,909
an anti-tumor tool we have to prove that

248
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:48,519
it works in more physiological settings

249
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:50,679
so what happens if we reproduce these

250
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,990
effects in animal models of cancer and

251
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,969
what happens if we combine this

252
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,269
Cannavino it with the standard therapies

253
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,769
that these patients receive well to

254
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,470
answer this question we conducted a

255
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:04,028
series of experiments in animal models

256
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,550
of the three different subtypes of

257
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:11,200
cancer and we studied with a hormone

258
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:13,929
sensitive ones and first of all we

259
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,629
started with in vitro studies to see to

260
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:18,659
analyze the combination of tamoxifen

261
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:22,600
this is the drug we used for this

262
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:25,240
studies so we studied what happened when

263
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,940
combining tamoxifen and cannabinoids in

264
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,039
vitro and as you can see here this is

265
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,980
the effect that the moxa fen alone

266
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:34,750
produces this is the effect that THC

267
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,240
alone produces this is a very low

268
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,409
concentration of THC and when we combine

269
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,500
THC and tamoxifen we see a synergistic

270
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:47,289
response and exactly the same thing

271
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,500
happens when we use not pure THC but the

272
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:53,199
botanical drug preparation what happens

273
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,919
if we move to the in vivo we will

274
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,110
observe the same thing well in this case

275
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:03,129
what we represent is tumor volume the

276
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:06,700
size of the tumors versus time and this

277
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:09,189
white dots represent how these tumors

278
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,190
grow when the animals receive no

279
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:15,880
treatment so the tumor masses grow grow

280
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:19,270
with no control this is the Green Line

281
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:21,698
is the effect that THC alone produces

282
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:24,159
and the purple line again

283
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:25,688
is the effect that the botanical drug

284
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,399
preparation produces and I think it's

285
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:30,730
pretty obvious to see that is more

286
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,798
potent than the pure compound and not

287
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,949
only that but if we compare the effect

288
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:38,588
of the botanical preparation with that

289
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:40,808
of tamoxifen which is the current

290
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:43,389
treatment that patients with this type

291
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:47,289
of tumors receive you can see that the

292
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:50,198
potency is exactly the same one we also

293
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:52,629
combine a tamoxifen with the botanical

294
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:55,389
drug preparation and we didn't see a big

295
00:13:52,629 --> 00:14:00,819
increase in the antitumoral properties

296
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:03,159
of c of the preparation we perform

297
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:05,649
similar experiments in her to positive

298
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:10,028
models of breast cancer and in this case

299
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:12,188
we selected lapatinib one of the drugs

300
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:15,909
that target specifically target this

301
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:18,608
receptor and we obtained very very

302
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:22,988
similar results in vitro when combined

303
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:24,699
in lapatinib this drug with pure THC we

304
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:26,949
observed sign artistic responses

305
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:29,858
something very similar with the

306
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:32,288
botanical drug preparation and exactly

307
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:35,499
the same as we observed before in the in

308
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:38,019
vivo setting the white line again is the

309
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:43,329
control animals if we treat the animals

310
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:45,519
with pure THC we get modest antitumoral

311
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:48,308
response but if we use the whole pram

312
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,159
plant preparation the anti-tumor effect

313
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:53,828
is much much higher much bigger and if

314
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:57,818
we compare the antitumoral potency of

315
00:14:53,828 --> 00:15:00,278
the whole plant extract with that of

316
00:14:57,818 --> 00:15:02,889
lapatinib again we see that we have a

317
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:06,688
tool that is as potent as the current

318
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:10,298
medicine that these patients received

319
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:12,278
and what about the triple negative and I

320
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:14,350
remind you again the most aggressive

321
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,588
type of breast cancer that a woman can

322
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,100
have

323
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:21,119
well we observed exactly the same thing

324
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:25,418
when we combined in this case we used

325
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:26,980
chemotherapy agent cisplatin and this is

326
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:30,129
the effect that cisplatin produce alone

327
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:33,220
this is the effect that THC produces and

328
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:34,269
when we move to the in vivo again this

329
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,040
is THC

330
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:38,500
this is the botanical drug preparation

331
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:41,259
and as you can see it's more potent than

332
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,730
in the pure compound remain asleep the

333
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:46,059
rest of the lines because I don't have

334
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:49,060
time and the take-home message from this

335
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:51,639
part is that the THC rich extract is

336
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:55,419
more potent than pure THC both in vitro

337
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:58,659
and in vivo the THC rich extract is as

338
00:15:55,419 --> 00:16:00,879
potent as the standard therapies that we

339
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:03,629
tested that are the standard treatments

340
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,350
that these patients are receiving and

341
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,850
unfortunately the combination of

342
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,889
cannabinoids with the tested and the

343
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,960
cancer treatments didn't improve the

344
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,730
potency of either one of them I don't

345
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,280
have time to discuss discuss why we

346
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:19,990
think this is going on but that's what

347
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,429
we observed and as a conclusion we have

348
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,529
more than enough evidence that

349
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,629
cannabinoids are effective 22 more tools

350
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,879
in preclinical models of cancer all

351
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:30,039
breast cancer subtypes respond to

352
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,659
cannabinoids whole plant preparations

353
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:34,659
are more potent than pure cannabinoids

354
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:38,049
and whole plant extracts are as potent

355
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:40,000
as current therapies I don't want you to

356
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:42,879
go home with a conclusion that the

357
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,259
extract we used in this paper is the

358
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,120
extract you have to give to your

359
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:48,909
patients the only point we wanted to

360
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,919
make is that it's better to use whole

361
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:54,850
plant preparations than pure compounds

362
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:56,589
and I want to finish by thanking the

363
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,930
people that did the work I'm just here

364
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:02,889
presenting it but these are the guys

365
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:05,230
that did it and here there is my small

366
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:09,150
team and I want to thank of course the

367
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:12,029
team of Unseld s that was absolutely

368
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:15,690
necessary for the performance of these

369
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:15,690
experiments thank you very much

370
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:24,908
you have time for one question if you

371
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:28,579
like what one minute left

372
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:30,799
Christina very nice there were small

373
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:35,689
amounts of Canaveral and

374
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:37,940
tetrahydrocannabinol a gas 'add have you

375
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,769
had the chance to test those to see if

376
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,150
they were the ones that made the

377
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:41,778
difference yeah that's an excellent

378
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,269
question

379
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:47,119
yeah I didn't point it to in in this

380
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:49,308
light but the extract had a little bit

381
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,819
of juicy VG and a little bit of another

382
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:55,759
cannabinoid THC a and we did check if

383
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:57,589
CBG combining THC and CBD we could

384
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,599
reproduce the effects and we were not

385
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:01,398
able to we haven't done the experiments

386
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:05,319
with THC a but that's something we want

387
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:05,319
to do a first very good question thing
