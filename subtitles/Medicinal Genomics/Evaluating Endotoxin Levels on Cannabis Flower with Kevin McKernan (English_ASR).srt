00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:44,239
endotoxins and store bought cannabis

55
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,878
flour our conversation covers what

56
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,439
inspired Kevin to look into endotoxin

57
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,199
levels on

58
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:54,039
cannabis the microbes that produce

59
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,079
endotoxins and their effect on

good afternoon Kevin thanks for joining

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,519
us on the

83
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:11,199
podcast I don't know I don't know where

84
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,759
you guys find such trash to come on this

85
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:18,159
podcast but here I am oh you're too

86
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:20,079
modest you're one of our best guests and

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,720
you are our first guest

88
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,040
so all right they can never take that

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,600
one away from

90
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,439
you so I'm excited to talk with you

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,320
today about something that's a little

92
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,719
bit different because because in the

93
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,759
past your canmed presentations and when

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,039
you've come on the podcast before talked

95
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,199
a lot about sequencing whether it's

96
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,240
cannabis or mushrooms or even viroids

97
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,879
but this year at camed 24 you're

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,079
presenting on something a little bit

99
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,399
different we're talking about

100
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,519
endotoxins which isn't just a new topic

101
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,679
for you it seems like it's a new topic

102
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,000
for the industry overall um but before

103
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,199
we get into how or why the industry

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,839
should start thinking about endotoxins I

105
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,120
think it's it's important to explain

106
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:06,439
what they are and why you became

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,240
interested in in investigating

108
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:12,600
them okay so uh I'll start with the why

109
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,960
first and then lead to well now we do

110
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,960
let's do what they are first so people

111
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:19,079
know why we're anchoring into this so um

112
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,519
endotoxins are molecules that are found

113
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,159
on gram negative bacteria on their on

114
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,439
their cell wall all right so they embed

115
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,840
inside this this lipid Bayer and um

116
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,839
they're they're known to be really

117
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,519
potent anaphylaxis um agents if they're

118
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,839
if they're found in an injectable all

119
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:39,279
right so when I used to work at Ain

120
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,359
Court we had all this demand to make um

121
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,679
endotoxin-free plasmid purification kits

122
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,520
so we had a whole program and a whole

123
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,959
technology platform where we we built

124
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,680
these magnetic beads that stripped

125
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,120
endotoxins out of plasmid preps because

126
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,560
they're um if you need pharmaceutical gr

127
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,160
plasmas this is a real FDA concern you

128
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
got to test them for endotoxins and get

129
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,880
rid of the stuff but I never really

130
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,240
thought about it in terms of cannabis so

131
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:02,680
honestly had forgotten about it for like

132
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,199
a decade and then um and then the reason

133
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,519
they came to our attention is that um I

134
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,400
think it was on LinkedIn there was a

135
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:14,240
little bit of a back and forth going on

136
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:15,839
about decontamination and mot toxins um

137
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,439
uh and I think Tess had some really

138
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,799
interesting information saying hey we're

139
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,279
we're not looking at the right mot

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,280
toxins fusarium makes them bacteria make

141
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:27,318
endotoxins and then um another group in

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,119
Massachusetts um was asking a lot of

143
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,080
questions about you know what happened

144
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,399
in um the pre-roll facility

145
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,758
Massachusetts where someone died um this

146
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,719
is like created a big storm here in

147
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,080
Massachusetts the CDC is swept in to

148
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,639
start measuring things OSHA's involved

149
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,120
there's been fines handed out um so um

150
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,478
for those who aren't familiar with this

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,120
case um uh I won't add the patient's

152
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,680
name because I I noticed the CDC

153
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,399
documentation didn't do that so I'll

154
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,240
stick to their guidance here but a

155
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,120
patient it wasn't a patient I'm sorry it

156
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,598
was an employee that worked in a

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,560
pre-roll facility in Massachusetts um

158
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:05,000
had an allergic reaction in the facility

159
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,800
and and like died and um and I believe

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,079
she was a cannabis user so that everyone

161
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,478
everyone was really confused by that

162
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,359
like if this person was allergic to

163
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,038
cannabis she wouldn't be consuming it so

164
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,360
what the hell happened in the pre-

165
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:19,519
facility that suddenly made her um have

166
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,960
an asthmatic reaction um now they they

167
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,038
uh there's some debate whether they had

168
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,680
the proper masks and the proper HEPA

169
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,279
filters and all that and I don't I don't

170
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,038
know where that all that landed all I

171
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,279
know is that by the time the CDC got in

172
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,199
there to try to measure this

173
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,079
retrospectively um the facility had

174
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,680
already implemented some better HVAC to

175
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,279
try to address this so they they

176
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,160
responded to try to you know mitigate

177
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,318
whatever risk they could and and no one

178
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,520
really knew what it was like something

179
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,639
Airborne must have gotten to her um so

180
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,000
let's clean the

181
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,918
air um so that had a lot of people

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,399
asking us like what is this is there

183
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,639
some microbe that makes a toxin is there

184
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,079
uh is the microbial testing to blame um

185
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,840
pre-rolls are notoriously higher in

186
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,878
microbial content for whatever reason

187
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,839
they're either lower quality flowers

188
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,360
that don't have bag appeal or maybe

189
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,799
they're lower branches and there's

190
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,960
higher concentration you know we don't

191
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,319
know the answer for that but they tend

192
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,198
to have a higher microbial burden um and

193
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,520
uh maybe grinding them up is something

194
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,120
that liberates more of them and there is

195
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,719
this possibility that they're they're

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,918
often um decontaminated or radiated now

197
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,319
we don't have good labeling here in

198
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,918
Massachusetts to know if that was

199
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,400
happening here or not um so that was on

200
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,598
the table and we had a lot of people

201
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,638
just asking questions like what do we do

202
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,199
for uh you know we're not seeing

203
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,560
patients die but got if the employees

204
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,719
that are handling this stuff are dying

205
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,598
then you have to assume there may be

206
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,839
some artifacts that are hitting patients

207
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,080
and they're just not getting maybe

208
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,880
reported as being connected to their

209
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,440
Canabis use so um that got me digging

210
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,399
into the the literature a little bit on

211
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,560
this and um someone I know who's an

212
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,159
endotoxin specialist was like oh yeah

213
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,559
you you should you should know about

214
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,879
this I mean the tobacco Fields had to

215
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,119
deal with this all the time tobacco

216
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,559
cigarettes have endotoxin and in fact

217
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,600
they don't think it's the tobacco that's

218
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,239
killing people they think it's the

219
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,759
endotoxin I mean some small branch of

220
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,240
people believe this that they're that

221
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:07,159
the endotoxin is what's causing a a um

222
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,919
bronchial inflammation and it's it's not

223
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,519
really the nicotine that's doing this

224
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:13,159
this is uh the the other contaminants in

225
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
the tobacco that tend to come along for

226
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:17,600
the ride can create inflammation in the

227
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,120
lungs and COPD and Asthma and a host of

228
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,639
other problems so um that put me down a

229
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,120
rabbit hole of literature reading into

230
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,838
this um and then I stumbled across some

231
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,240
literature that implied 40% of the

232
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,279
bacteria on cannabis is gram negative so

233
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,959
it should be endotoxin loaded um which

234
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,958
shocked me I went over to our

235
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,639
informatics guy Steve and said is this

236
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,919
true like search our database for

237
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,600
everything we've ever sequenced the one

238
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,879
the one nice thing we have here at MDC

239
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,159
is there's like you know thousand

240
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,439
samples of cannabis that have been

241
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,879
sequenced mostly stems but some Roots

242
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,800
some flowers and and leaves uh where we

243
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,439
can measure like what's the microbiome

244
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,000
content of these things and is it true

245
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,880
that 40% of these things are in fact

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,320
gram negative and we comb through that

247
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,360
for about a day and we're like yeah the

248
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,278
guy's right there's actually a whole lot

249
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,360
of klebsiella there's a whole lot of um

250
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,958
these other gram negative bacteria that

251
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,959
we're finding in the microbiome data so

252
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,919
um that person spot on um what do what

253
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,078
do we do about this um so that's kind of

254
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:16,319
where the the the project started is we

255
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,120
said all right why don't we get

256
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,920
ourselves an endotoxin assay kit we can

257
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,519
run that on like a cubit which is one of

258
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,319
these portable fluorometers that's

259
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,000
probably the cheapest thing you could

260
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,240
ever purchase for a Laboratory um it's

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,159
about I don't know $7,000 or something

262
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,399
to buy this Cubit uh and uh we use those

263
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,480
for measuring DNA concentrations and RNA

264
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,958
concent they're they're kind of a

265
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,759
universal Swiss army knife really

266
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,479
affable um so we're like all right we

267
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,600
can run on that thing and assess um if

268
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,800
there's any endotoxin on on on on

269
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,278
pre-rolls or cannabis and uh that kind

270
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,078
of evolved into asking different

271
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,519
questions of like maybe we should look

272
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,958
at cannabis that comes out of the

273
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,560
dispensary system because we know it's

274
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,799
tested to have low cfu and let's look at

275
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,559
some stuff that's in the HP Market that

276
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,559
isn't tested and usually in our

277
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,879
experience the hemp Market in

278
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,599
Massachusetts has really high cfus

279
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,759
everything from from Total use in mole

280
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,720
total Ric counts it's it's um it's grown

281
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:14,439
Outdoors probably using a lot of organic

282
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,320
farming um so uh we went around and and

283
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,000
and got some samples from hemp

284
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,959
facilities and then purchased some from

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,480
dispensaries that had uh that had been

286
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,919
through testing we don't have any

287
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,800
knowledge of of whether they've using

288
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:28,479
any decontamination techniques but um we

289
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,278
uh one one would naturally assume that

290
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,800
when you contaminate these things you

291
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:36,679
prevent the microbes from growing but

292
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,519
whatever's there is uh has endotoxin so

293
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:42,399
the decontamination doesn't get rid of

294
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,039
that uh and so it's quite likely that um

295
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,600
it would it would be remaining so the

296
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,719
the hemp samples we picked up were like

297
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,200
screaming hot three million cfus per

298
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,120
gram like off the scale hot 30 times

299
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,600
above the limit and then of course

300
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,799
everything we pull from the dispensary

301
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,200
side was clean uh like so very very

302
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,278
clean like almost zero 100 maybe

303
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,959
thousands use at most um and then we

304
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,000
went about running quantitative PCR on

305
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,278
those plating those and then also

306
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,679
looking at live Dead with quantitive PCR

307
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,679
because one thing we noticed with um

308
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:18,519
modern Cana was that um we have this

309
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:22,319
live dead kit that gets rid of dead DNA

310
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:25,039
and when she was I think it was um um ah

311
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,760
Jenny Jenny uh I'm forgetting

312
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,879
her that's it glaris yeah um so the uh

313
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,439
what she she did a nice study that she

314
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,519
showed at camman last year where she was

315
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,720
using Liv dead PCR uh with grim reefer

316
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,440
to look at a radiated samples and she

317
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,839
noticed that in some cases the the the

318
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,240
Grim reefer didn't get rid of all the

319
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,760
DNA it lowered it but it's still in some

320
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,198
cases was testing hot uh whereas the

321
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,078
plating was completely blank and um that

322
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:54,919
got us looking into okay is our nucleus

323
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:57,439
not working are there viable but not

324
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:00,759
culturable cells there are there is

325
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,480
there something about um uh PCR that's

326
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,399
just the radiation can kill the organism

327
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,560
but not destroy the DNA enough so some

328
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,278
of the Dead DNA is still around and the

329
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,479
dnasis can't get to it we kind of went

330
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,198
down this Rabbit Hole trying to figure

331
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,360
out why can't we get the the live de

332
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:20,359
qpcr um to perfectly match plating after

333
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,159
radiation um what she I think concluded

334
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,399
from that study was that okay what we'll

335
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,000
have to do is uh enrich after um

336
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,039
radiation to know if there's anything

337
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,720
there um that's viable that way we can

338
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,559
we can use live dead PCR and a little

339
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,079
bit of enrichment and perhaps you know

340
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,039
sort this problem out but it's certainly

341
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:40,919
left um Tess and a few other people in

342
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,919
the field like worried that if we build

343
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,799
a a a pipeline in cannabis where people

344
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,278
can grow the dirtiest stuff possible and

345
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,559
then just blast it at the end uh just

346
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:53,639
because it can counterfeit a plating

347
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,159
system is that really safe like what if

348
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,919
what if it's loaded with mot toxins and

349
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:58,639
endotoxins and all this other garbage

350
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,838
and you're just finding a way to evade

351
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
the the detection tool that they're

352
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,600
using in the industry by doing this

353
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,240
radiation thing and then of course

354
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,199
there's concerns over it's not labeled

355
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,039
and the patients don't know about it so

356
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,679
um it got us looking looking in that

357
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,719
area a little bit more and uh I don't

358
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,958
know that's kind that's kind of how the

359
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,240
project snowballed yeah no and thanks

360
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:21,159
for that and you did write up a great

361
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,600
white paper um kind of summarizing this

362
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:24,958
whole this whole study which I'll put a

363
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,199
link in the show description so people

364
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,758
can read it and so I mean you mentioned

365
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,359
the results and and there's a there's a

366
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,839
great graph in here that kind of shows

367
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,440
that of sort of the endotoxin levels and

368
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,480
then the pre and post Grim reefer um

369
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,120
information here and I mean but when I

370
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,680
look at that and and tell me if I'm

371
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,320
reading this correctly that it looked

372
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,679
like on every sample there was a

373
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,759
significant level of endotoxins is that

374
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,439
right yeah it it was and that was kind

375
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,079
of the shocking thing that we found was

376
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
that there wasn't a sample that was free

377
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,239
of it um now it varied you know several

378
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,440
orders of magnitude between the samples

379
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,120
but the lowest sample was several orders

380
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,279
of magnitude over the decost limit which

381
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,919
you know we're going to have to assess

382
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,759
in the field like what what that limit

383
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,519
should be the decost limit for people

384
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,199
know is it's a European Standard for the

385
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,480
amount of um endotoxin that can be in

386
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,679
breathable air so they have it set at 90

387
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,159
eus per square meter yeah um you know

388
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,679
we're we're dealing with a gram of

389
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,159
cannabis which is a million times

390
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,559
smaller than a square meter so uh and

391
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,958
we're having numbers that are orders of

392
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,479
magnitude higher on on the Cannabis so

393
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,359
uh I don't know if they've set a

394
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,959
standard for like what that should be

395
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,680
for an inhalable product but I would

396
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,518
assume that the inhalable product should

397
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,159
should probably be close

398
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,000
to the the limit for what's tolerable

399
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,838
for the employees in the in the air um

400
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,440
and there are some some studies listed

401
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,800
in there from the CDC and from a couple

402
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,440
other parties where they went into to

403
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,838
look at the endotoxin levels just in the

404
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,360
air at certain work environments uh in

405
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,720
the Cannabis field uh the CC had one

406
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,360
study that showed that 40% of the

407
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,600
employees were exposed to levels that

408
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,079
were higher than um in the trimming

409
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,800
facility that were higher than the the

410
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,078
the decost limits um another study

411
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,240
looked at this in hemp um and a couple

412
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:07,679
other like lung diseases that were

413
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,399
showing up for workers that were that

414
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,599
were handling a lot of hemp so there's

415
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,399
there have been a couple other data

416
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,240
points looking at this um it's important

417
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,720
to know that when the CDC went into this

418
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,480
facility in Massachusetts that's the

419
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,399
that's what they began looking for um

420
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,159
they began looking at at for endotoxin

421
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,799
levels so um their radar is up on it and

422
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:28,159
that's what got us looking at it is we

423
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,439
said all right if they're if if that's

424
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,198
what they're coming in to investigate we

425
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,040
should probably get an understanding of

426
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,159
how much of this is actually just around

427
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,958
on the flowers because we can't really

428
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,078
find a whole lot of papers that speak to

429
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,919
that um we can find some things on

430
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,799
Tobacco and a couple studies that were

431
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,759
done in these environmental exposure

432
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:50,838
studies so um so yeah the the numbers

433
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:53,519
are are are very high um I I don't know

434
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,600
if this you know obviously if this were

435
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,879
so toxic there's a lot of cannabis use

436
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,278
out there people would be dropping like

437
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,278
flies we we don't see that um I think

438
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,120
what may have happened with this

439
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:03,559
unfortunate case is that this person may

440
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,919
have had a pre-existing condition of

441
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,720
some sort asthma and this just was the

442
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,439
hair that broke the camel's back it it

443
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,160
maybe exacerbated the problem and um we

444
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,720
we have to pay you know may maybe close

445
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,160
attention to Patient use in this case so

446
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,959
maybe the medical field needs to think a

447
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,519
little bit more carefully about this um

448
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,480
I mean the the other thing that came up

449
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:25,078
that wasn't really mentioned in the

450
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,839
paper that but we've been pondering

451
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:31,440
since then is um well can we use gr

452
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,359
positive bacteria as biocontrol agents

453
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,120
to like out compete this stuff so it's

454
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,159
not around and that's probably a really

455
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:41,439
good idea billus is something that's

456
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:44,320
commonly used as a as a um biocontrol

457
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,759
agent and billus is gram positive so

458
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,798
maybe you flood the plants with basilla

459
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,720
so you can knock out all the gram

460
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,679
negatives and then we don't have this

461
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,519
problem anymore um so it may it may lead

462
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,038
to better cultivation techniques um you

463
00:17:54,519 --> 00:18:00,119
know the only challenge with billus our

464
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,359
PCR tests will hit it on the TAC uh

465
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:05,239
amplion it won't hit it on the eoli or

466
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:07,918
the sex stuff but the the TAC plates

467
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,558
from 3M will light up with billas so a

468
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,640
lot of people are penalized right now

469
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:14,480
for using bio control agents that might

470
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,600
mitigate this problem uh because the

471
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,839
testing Rec the testing tools they're

472
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:21,079
using will pick it up um and so it's

473
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,678
really ironic because they have this

474
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,000
testing platform that tries to grow

475
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,480
everything on plates and it's penalizing

476
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,440
for using the biocontrol agents that

477
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,839
could get rid of the gram negatives that

478
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,640
in fact the testing platform you can

479
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,038
then evade by radiating it's this big

480
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,640
like circular nonsense that we've got

481
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:36,960
high tack counts so we'll radiate it and

482
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,919
it doesn't get rid of the endotoxin now

483
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,840
you can put it on plates that uh that

484
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,038
basically don't show any growth when the

485
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:43,798
real answer may have been to actually

486
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,558
put billus on there that would fail your

487
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:48,639
your 3M plate and you wouldn't have the

488
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:51,279
endotoxin problem but um yeah we have a

489
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,120
lot to learn I think uh in the microbial

490
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,960
space and cannabis and what we do for

491
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,279
this but um there are some some

492
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,360
citations in the paper uh talking about

493
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,918
what these exposure levels are like what

494
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,719
they learn from the tobacco industry

495
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,919
about this and how they try and keep

496
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,319
those levels down um the tobacco

497
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,480
industry is obviously a little bit

498
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,759
different in that every tobacco

499
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,400
cigarette tends to tends to have a

500
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,038
filter on it which we don't necessarily

501
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,120
have on on the Cannabis stuff and we

502
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:15,679
don't know how much of that is is

503
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,399
scrubbing the endotoxin out of the out

504
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,679
of the smoke but they do run tests on

505
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,919
Sid stream and and stuff through filters

506
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,480
to see how much is coming through in

507
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,240
tobacco and they can in fact see it I've

508
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,279
not measured tobacco leaves themselves

509
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,919
to see how much is on there that's

510
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,599
something we may do next week when we

511
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:35,159
get some new kits in but um but yeah the

512
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:37,240
amount on cannabis flowers is High um it

513
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,559
does vary orders of magnitude but it all

514
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,120
seems to be above these decost limits

515
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:45,879
and um the next question is can you does

516
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,678
does pyrolytic kill this stuff right um

517
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,080
the the problem we have in the research

518
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,840
field is that endotoxin is one of these

519
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,879
things that when it's around you can't

520
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,798
autoclave your way out of it it tends to

521
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,440
survive autoclaves which is like high

522
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:00,679
pressure and heat and you know what

523
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,558
we're using to vaporize cannabis is like

524
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,200
low pressure and heat but it's heat for

525
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,960
like a brief period of time and it

526
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,440
doesn't doesn't torch the whole flower

527
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,960
it just tortures the tip so there's

528
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,038
possibility that a lot of endotoxin can

529
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,159
come out of smoke I mean that'd be a

530
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,200
really interesting study if people can

531
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,520
figure out how to capture um endotoxin

532
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,440
out of smoke stream some of the some of

533
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:20,359
the people studying the vape pens um

534
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,279
would be I think wise to do that there's

535
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,918
there's actually literature of

536
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:26,599
endotoxins in and tobacco vape pens oh

537
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,280
yeah that's the tobacco process of

538
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,359
people getting I don't know how that

539
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,480
happens because I don't think they're

540
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,759
extracting nicotine from from Plants I

541
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,120
thought figured it was just a chemical

542
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,558
synthesis they put those things but they

543
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:39,719
have they have noted endotoxin inside of

544
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,519
um tobacco vape pens uh in which case

545
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,440
I'm really curious to know how much of

546
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,200
this stuff actually ends up in the

547
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,679
canabo oils because it it it is it it's

548
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,360
a molecule that looks like it's going to

549
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,400
be more um lipophilic um and that it

550
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,798
likes to be in a lipid Bayer so will

551
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,360
will it end up in the extraction

552
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,960
enriched or will it end up in um you

553
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,359
know some other um fra fraction of the

554
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,798
distillation process I lot of lot more

555
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:06,199
questions than answers we have right now

556
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,038
yeah and that would be particularly

557
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,519
concerning because um I mean as I

558
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,400
understand it a lot of times if flow is

559
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:16,278
failing for microbial um sort of the

560
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,600
solution a lot of times is to extract it

561
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:20,960
or turn it into distillate and then you

562
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,759
know right I always assume that was the

563
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,159
S thing to do yeah yeah absolutely in

564
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,519
which case Ethan

565
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,960
Russo yeah Ethan Russo and I think maybe

566
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,798
it was Jeff

567
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,919
a couple people have done studies on

568
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,158
some of the risks of of extracting for

569
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,080
safety uh and and one of the concerns

570
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,840
was uh pesticides and myotoxins could

571
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,319
enrich differentially in the extraction

572
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,199
process like the cannabinoids might go

573
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:45,798
from 20% to 80% but you can see the

574
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,880
pesticides go from like you know parts

575
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,359
per Millions to parts per thousands like

576
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,919
they they would enrich to a higher

577
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,119
degree than the cannaboids themselves

578
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,000
and so they they raised concerns over um

579
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:58,639
differential capture of those things so

580
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,278
those are all good questions uh that we

581
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:06,038
have now for what this endotoxin can do

582
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:08,038
um so yeah again we've not seen people

583
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:10,079
dropping like FES from endotoxins but

584
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:12,519
there is this this fatality here in mass

585
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,918
and it has got the federal government uh

586
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,839
looking under uh you know the whole

587
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,919
production process here uh and if we are

588
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,278
at the stage of maybe descheduling or

589
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,440
going to schedule three and there's

590
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:24,880
going to be more Federal um overhang on

591
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,200
the Cannabis industry we probably have

592
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,720
to start paying attention to what

593
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,360
they're doing and and and start looking

594
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,240
at um the source of these of these

595
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,719
contaminants I mean I'm really intrigued

596
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,759
by the the biocontrol agents with

597
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,159
basilis just because um if you could

598
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,798
flood the plants with gr positives then

599
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,600
there's there's less likely for there to

600
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,278
be um an issue there and and likewise

601
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,199
there's a there's a I think a valid

602
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:51,519
point to many of the I think the points

603
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,240
you've seen Tess on on LinkedIn Rays is

604
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,359
like look it's never a good

605
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,480
manufacturing process to to to do things

606
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,678
dirty and mop up at the end right you

607
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,319
want to eventually build you know some

608
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,000
level of sterility into your grow I mean

609
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,599
it can't be perfectly sterile obviously

610
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,960
plants need microbes but um there is

611
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,798
such a wide variation in the genetics

612
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,200
that can

613
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,720
um that in terms of their cfu that you

614
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,480
get like the the work from zamir was

615
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,919
really interesting that he showed the

616
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,360
total yeast and mold ratios were or a

617
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,240
genetic characteristic of the plant so

618
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,798
he had plants that would always have

619
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,440
genetically would just have higher yeast

620
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,879
and mold burdens than other lines and it

621
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,440
was something that went the genetics of

622
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,440
of what they're growing so that tells

623
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,640
tells you something about um you know we

624
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,840
can find a way to breed cannabis that's

625
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,240
low in these microbial burdens so that

626
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,959
we don't have to mop up a mess at the

627
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,440
end and wonder if there's microt toxins

628
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,200
or endotoxins that are coming through

629
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,080
that we can't measure um I mean you know

630
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,759
there are good ways to measure mot

631
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:52,278
toxins and now endotoxins um it's just

632
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,720
uh one of those things that doesn't

633
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:56,278
shine through in every state I don't

634
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,679
think every state has mandatory microt

635
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:01,798
toxin testing um and no one has

636
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,679
endotoxin testing and frankly looking at

637
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:05,480
the data we have now I'd be like forget

638
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,720
the microtox look at the endotoxin

639
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,360
because it's everywhere it's when I talk

640
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,839
to people who run the microt toxin test

641
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,879
they're like we almost never get a hit

642
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:16,480
on those things it's just

643
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,880
like testing why is it that mot toxins

644
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,720
became you know something that's

645
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,200
required testing and endotoxins kind of

646
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,480
went

647
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,480
unnoticed it's a good question I mean

648
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,919
microt toxins made their way in into the

649
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,360
food industry and you know there's they

650
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,679
are more of an oral ingestion risk

651
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:34,678
because they they tend to have effects

652
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,519
on your liver um whereas endotoxin isn't

653
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,159
something that's that's really an oral

654
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,519
ingestion risk so you know like the

655
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,240
edible pipeline doesn't need to worry

656
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,918
about this it's really more of

657
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,720
inhalation and injection in fact

658
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:45,880
injection is the real thing that the FDA

659
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,519
worries about because you get

660
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,240
anaphylaxis and people drop but

661
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,798
inhalation is something I think has been

662
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,720
one of these areas where um I mean I

663
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,798
have to look up the farmer RS for like

664
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,159
uh the limits on this for for like

665
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:59,839
asthma inhalers and stuff stuff I'm sure

666
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,278
they're very low but I think when you

667
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,678
get into the realm of like tobacco and

668
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,159
cannabis you're like okay you guys are

669
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,559
inhaling like you know pyrolytic anyway

670
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,880
so who cares about about what what else

671
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,519
you're adding you I I just don't think

672
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,840
that they've had the same like scrutiny

673
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,839
it's it's almost as if You' you've

674
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,480
committed yourselves to performing at

675
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,038
something risky so you're probably not

676
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,640
too concerned about the other risks that

677
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:21,640
are there and there's always this

678
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,120
question the flame probably destroys it

679
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,759
all right uh it's probably not true

680
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:30,398
given the temperatures that people Vape

681
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:32,240
at but um it's adds a uh an element of

682
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:36,079
um the pyrolytic seems to sometimes

683
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240
offer an out on on what's present so I

684
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,639
have a feeling it has something to do

685
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,839
with that just that um if you're

686
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,559
inhaling these if you're willing to

687
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,720
light something on fire inhale it anyway

688
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:44,440
then no one's got a whole lot of

689
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,000
sympathy if there's some contaminates

690
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,640
around but um I think the medicine when

691
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
it comes to actual ingestion uh it

692
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,559
probably does need to we need to think

693
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,398
about microt toxins if they're at high

694
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,158
levels I've not seen a lot of people who

695
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:58,759
test for those things so they come out

696
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,840
you know more than like one % positivity

697
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,798
in uh in testing I always hear of like

698
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,720
one in a thousand or one in 500 samples

699
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,679
might pop positive for a Mot toxin test

700
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,640
but uh it's nowhere near the um it

701
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,519
doesn't match the level of like 10%

702
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,759
failing for to Total yeast and mold You'

703
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,759
think if you had that much yeast and

704
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,038
mold everywhere you'd You' you'd have

705
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:20,119
some concordance with the actual um mot

706
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,079
toxin test so um what we can see from

707
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:25,079
this data is that yeah when there's

708
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,879
bacteria there um and and even when it's

709
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,879
been Zapped or it doesn't it doesn't

710
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,200
show like we can see in this paper there

711
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,039
is in some cases there is um bacterial

712
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,519
DNA present and it doesn't grow that

713
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,359
tells us okay someone probably

714
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,918
decontaminated this and the endotoxin is

715
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:44,719
screaming High um so the DNA can maybe

716
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,200
help navigate some of this um but uh you

717
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,839
know when it comes down

718
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,919
to um some samples that are just totally

719
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:53,720
you know no DNA uh no evidence of of

720
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,278
growth but they're screaming high with

721
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,519
endotoxin um that's I don't know that's

722
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,919
another matter and we probably have to

723
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:03,278
understand what the lower limit um can

724
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:05,919
be uh from from a patient

725
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,278
standpoint yeah and the other point too

726
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,080
when you talk about sort of the

727
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,440
pyrolytic or you know lighting it on

728
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:12,960
fire might take take care of the

729
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,278
endotoxins might you know eliminate them

730
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,880
but it doesn't solve the problem of the

731
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,038
people who are working in the production

732
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,159
facility or you know like the the person

733
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:21,079
in

734
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:23,278
Massachusetts yeah and I think you had a

735
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:25,199
you had a podcast on with an aspergillis

736
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,640
expert who who always brings up this

737
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,080
point that when they do these paralytic

738
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,559
test that yeah there's a very high

739
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,759
temperature at the very at the end of

740
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,278
The Joint but the rest of the joint is

741
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:37,519
getting an elevated temperature but not

742
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,359
hot enough to destroy the spores so you

743
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,639
can get active spores coming out of a

744
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,918
joint in fact we've seen this in the

745
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,278
Bakersville case where they had

746
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:48,360
cryptococcus infection of a patient um

747
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,679
and um that ended up with menitis um so

748
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,719
yeah the the pre-rolls seem to be the

749
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,960
part of the pipeline that's dirtiest uh

750
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,519
and where we see the most fails and

751
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,000
where we probably need to have the most

752
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,399
attention that happened in or too when

753
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,558
we looked at the whole Oregon story

754
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:03,199
theyve when they turned on aspergillis

755
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,000
testing they were having like 10 to 20%

756
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,960
failures in the pre-rolls but their

757
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,759
flowers were down at like two or three%

758
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,919
like California and it's just a a signal

759
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,119
that we tried to make clear to The

760
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,120
Regulators that look you have a

761
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,158
biological signal here that would

762
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,079
satisfy a Bradford Hill criteria for

763
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,640
causation you you have what's known to

764
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,759
be a dirtier process for making

765
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,278
pre-rolls from from all the scrap

766
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:28,158
material that's testing hot and you have

767
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:31,759
you know high quality um bag of Peel

768
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,679
flour that's testing low um this is this

769
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,720
is a sign of something that's going on

770
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,000
you know we should look into this and

771
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,000
and maybe the maybe the pre-rolls have

772
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,880
to go through a different

773
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,599
decontamination process and maybe extra

774
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,840
mot toxin checks or something but um I

775
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,519
think they've opted to just throw their

776
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,480
hands in the air and move on but um the

777
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,480
uh I mean the data that we're seeing

778
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,960
here in mass is is uh it's not something

779
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,360
we can turn away from I think the main

780
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,880
argument they had in Oregon is well no

781
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,240
one's ever found someone who got hurt

782
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,360
from this and that's that's a fine

783
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,359
argument if you put your head in the

784
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,119
sand and you don't look but we actually

785
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,439
have a fatality here in

786
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,079
Massachusetts and no one was necessarily

787
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,360
looking for it the person literally had

788
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,278
to drop dead on the floor at work for

789
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,000
people to pay attention to it we don't

790
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,880
know how many people are getting asthma

791
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,440
attacks outside of uh the workplace and

792
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,840
just consuming from consuming Purity

793
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,558
cannabis it's probably going um

794
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,278
unregistered and that that is a problem

795
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,639
with a lot of the the Cannabis

796
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,000
literature out there is that for all the

797
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,880
time of prohibition we didn't have

798
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,839
people running into the hospital

799
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,039
declaring I'm a cannabis user help me

800
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,759
they're hiding it because it could get

801
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,359
their kids taken away from them you know

802
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:40,558
so uh the uh the best we have right now

803
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:43,719
are studies from like the CDC that point

804
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:46,079
to Insurance data showing that okay

805
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,120
cannabis users have an elevated risk of

806
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,359
of um bungal infections and the icd10

807
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,639
codes like point of mucr micosis and

808
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:57,599
aspil losis as like the the the two top

809
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,640
um risk factors that are there um but

810
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,879
other than that it's a lot of people

811
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,278
sort of claiming well we never had to do

812
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,679
this during prohibition so why do we

813
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:08,519
have to do it now and um that's that's

814
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,720
that's fine if you want to socialize the

815
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:11,919
risks of the business but uh it's not

816
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,240
necessarily I think where things are

817
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,600
going to end up when um the FDA gets

818
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,120
involved if they ever get

819
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:21,038
involved yeah and so is that where

820
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,038
you're you're kind of hoping is one of

821
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,240
the results of of looking into this is

822
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,359
that we should kind of start looking or

823
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,440
at least you know consider that end

824
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,798
toxins might be a factor here I

825
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,759
definitely think others should look into

826
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:35,599
this no one should take our work uh

827
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,440
alone it's a pre-print right now it's it

828
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,959
needs to be reproduced and and it should

829
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,919
be reproduced in multiple jurisdictions

830
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,079
before any regulator gets crazy with

831
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,120
this because uh we don't know what this

832
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,879
means um I think what we want to see is

833
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:50,599
lots of reproduction in the academic

834
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,960
space or in um uh you know just in the

835
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:56,798
scientific literature uh and then get

836
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,200
some assessment as to is this is this

837
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,240
associated with other people having

838
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,000
asthma attacks um it is a very of all

839
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,798
the things that we can do in the

840
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,319
Cannabis field this is probably the

841
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:07,839
cheapest thing one can measure and I'm

842
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,519
sad to say we don't have any like

843
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,480
Revenue stream attached to this thing

844
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,839
because it is a uh it's not our it's not

845
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,599
our technology we're just buying this

846
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:18,319
stuff from Thermo um and uh but it's

847
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,719
it's very cheap it's very

848
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:24,240
um you know small format I don't know if

849
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,558
you guys can see this but uh right there

850
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,120
your background fighting against us here

851
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:31,319
yeah it is I have to put it on my face

852
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,319
so you see it over my

853
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,678
forehead people listening can't see this

854
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:38,319
but this is basically a standard curve

855
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,880
of a l assay it's it's it's one of these

856
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:43,558
assays that um has to use an enzyme if

857
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,399
you send me a picture I can superimpose

858
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:47,599
it up there for you oh yeah it's

859
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:50,359
probably one in the paper um but yeah

860
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,398
it's um so there there's this uh

861
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:54,599
clotting factor in the blood of the

862
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,638
horseshoe crab which is Blue Blood um

863
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,278
that actually when endotoxin shows up it

864
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:00,519
creates a clot Cascade and so they've

865
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:02,119
they've hijacked that that enzyme to to

866
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,720
to create this sort of fluorometric

867
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:06,359
assay that that basically um gives you

868
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,519
different color based on the amount of

869
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:09,599
endotoxins that's there so uh I mean

870
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,240
this is something that runs in a

871
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,918
portable uh fluorometer that's that you

872
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,399
could it's smaller than a PCR machine

873
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,960
it's probably the cheapest thing anyone

874
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:18,518
could Pro possibly put into a Cannabis

875
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,200
Testing laboratory and it only it's

876
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,480
probably only you know 10 bucks a sample

877
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,440
or something so it is it is really fast

878
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,558
and cheap to run this it's something

879
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,798
that is run quite frequently in the um

880
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,200
Pharmaceutical industry to make sure

881
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:31,839
there is an endotoxin in any of the

882
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,759
drugs um and any injectables uh so

883
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,678
there's a large industry behind how to

884
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,200
do this and do it properly I mean the

885
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,960
the one challenge that I think we've had

886
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,679
with the assay is that you you do have

887
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,000
to run this in Matrix um because the L

888
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,320
assay there isn't a really good way to

889
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,839
purify endotoxin away from all the other

890
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,079
stuff that it's with um which means

891
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,240
you're you're you're having to take

892
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,319
cannabis flow homogenize it dilute it

893
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,638
really we T we basically dilute it 1 to

894
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,720
10 after we've like put a gram of

895
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:01,359
cannabis in 10 MLS we take one micr of

896
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,798
that into and dilute it one to 10 and

897
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,079
pop it into this assay and we get these

898
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,319
screaming High signals um but if you do

899
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,439
if you do it any more concentrated in

900
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,879
that the the tpen or I don't know what

901
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,519
but something seems to be interfering

902
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,159
with the assay and you get you get an

903
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,679
underrecording of the event when you do

904
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,919
that um but you know other than that

905
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,720
we've been able to go through probably

906
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,679
two dozen samples now of um different

907
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,319
flowers to show that we can get we can

908
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,679
we can pick it up with this portable

909
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:32,359
device that um is uh is is fairly cheap

910
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,759
the the the the reagents are very time

911
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:36,000
sensitive so the moment you crack them

912
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,119
you got to use them otherwise you start

913
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,359
it's the aay starts taking off on on

914
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:41,959
kind of background endotoxin so um

915
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:44,000
that's the only downside of the one that

916
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,960
that we're using is it's you can't like

917
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,519
crack the vials and and and leave them

918
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,960
out on the bench for two days and expect

919
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,200
to get good results the next day you

920
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,798
have to kind of be really fast with it

921
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,360
but um so yeah I I don't know where

922
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:58,278
where it will go I I hope um the the

923
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,599
other side of this is that could be

924
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:02,000
really interesting as a collaboration

925
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,000
with a testing laboratory is that there

926
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,159
are other techniques out there that

927
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,679
measure endotoxin with mass spec and

928
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,119
they're far more accurate and better but

929
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,960
they're far more expensive and they're

930
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:13,760
not portable and you know this but but

931
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,838
they're really good tools to to like

932
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,720
validate like all right is this really

933
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,398
working the way we needed to with the

934
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,719
Cannabis background that's there um

935
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:23,598
that's always good to have a second

936
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,199
assay to kind of check the books on this

937
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,679
stuff um and so um to the extent any

938
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,598
other cannabis out there has done

939
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,079
endotoxin testing please reach out we'd

940
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,519
love to like share notes and how we

941
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,320
could try to calibrate these things to

942
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:36,480
each other um and see if there's uh you

943
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,039
know there might be a way people can

944
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,480
just turn on their turn their Mass specs

945
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,440
onto a different column or a different

946
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,639
assay and and uh read this with

947
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,039
equipment they already have um but it

948
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:47,159
would be helpful study because I think

949
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,279
as as more and more of these

950
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,519
decontamination tools come to

951
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,040
Market we have to understand what it is

952
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:56,159
we're hiding you know it's one thing to

953
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:57,480
get rid of total robot count total robot

954
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,760
count is one of these weird things where

955
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,800
it's like you don't really know if it's

956
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,680
harmful or not you're just counting

957
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,400
total microbes but um and and when you

958
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:07,118
start doing these cleanup techniques um

959
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,720
yeah you're getting rid of what can grow

960
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,000
but are you getting rid of what you're

961
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,519
most worried about which is the

962
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,639
endotoxin um it doesn't seem like this

963
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,199
this is you know we're blinding

964
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:17,920
ourselves perhaps and giving ourselves a

965
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,399
false sense of security with this uh so

966
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,079
this might be a tool that can help

967
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,720
either guide that process um I mean one

968
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,200
one thing that we're we're working on

969
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:28,559
next on this um and this is actually I

970
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:30,559
have to compliment um uh test I'm

971
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,159
forgetting I'm going to butcher her last

972
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:33,759
name but I think you know her from um

973
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,440
some of the great podcast she's done and

974
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,520
put on LinkedIn um she looked at her

975
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,480
paper and was like this is cool you know

976
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,920
you could do do more replicates which is

977
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,280
always good advice um and then what

978
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,720
about getting rid of the gram positive

979
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,519
bacteria out there would you get a

980
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,279
better PCR correlation uh if you look in

981
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,639
our paper our correlation between like

982
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,400
qpcr and endotoxin is like 043 it's it's

983
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,440
it's there but it's not like you could

984
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,720
use the qpcr to predict this uh I think

985
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,318
some of that lack of correlation is that

986
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:05,399
we're not segregating the gram negative

987
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:07,838
from the gram positive in our qpcr test

988
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,400
we're just measuring total aerobic count

989
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,440
um so we've gone and designed some PCR

990
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,200
primers that are going to do try to do a

991
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,920
better job of like only give me

992
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:17,480
amplification from Gram positives and

993
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,358
only give me amplification from Gram

994
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,358
negatives and then we can try to

995
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,159
correlate the endotoxin levels with

996
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:26,119
those PCR signals and maybe those

997
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:27,920
signals will like get a 6 or 7%

998
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,920
correlation and so the the quantitative

999
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,318
PCR tests would not only count all Tac

1000
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,200
but would split them into two different

1001
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:37,039
channels of positives and negatives uh

1002
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,838
in in which case uh they may have a

1003
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,960
little bit more predictive power to run

1004
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:43,358
after after decontamination to know okay

1005
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,880
how much how much residual DNA is here

1006
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:46,719
that was gram negative because the gram

1007
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,440
negative DNA is is what we want to make

1008
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,199
sure is is really low uh that would tell

1009
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,480
us that the plant started with very

1010
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,879
little gram negative and therefore

1011
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,480
that's unlikely to have

1012
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,920
endotoxin um so we're poking around at

1013
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,760
at um some assays like that to see if

1014
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,318
they if they better inform on the topic

1015
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,560
but um to be honest the the the PCR

1016
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:07,400
might be helpful in the end the um the

1017
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:10,559
endotox and stuff runs just as quickly

1018
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:14,358
it's like a 30- minute assay uh and uh

1019
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:16,960
it it runs on a on a device that's um uh

1020
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:18,679
that's much like smaller footprint it's

1021
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,079
just hard to parallelize like we can't

1022
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:22,679
run 96 at a time without the reents kind

1023
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:25,720
of you know going bad on you in the

1024
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,358
process of setting up 96 assays so um we

1025
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:30,559
have it's great for about eight at a

1026
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,119
time uh and then um you have to probably

1027
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,400
start over with another strip tube of

1028
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,160
eight but um the PCR stuff we can really

1029
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,599
crank through and it might help us

1030
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,118
inform on um all right what's what's

1031
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,800
going on with uh this the the whole

1032
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,079
decontamination

1033
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,920
process excellent well it seems like uh

1034
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,318
definitely an interesting uh line of

1035
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,240
inquiry that we're going to continue to

1036
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:58,400
to look into um in the meantime is there

1037
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,078
other resources you you would like to

1038
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,200
point the audience to that they can

1039
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,599
learn more about this or uh if you want

1040
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:06,118
to share any ways that they can get in

1041
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,200
touch with you uh please do well

1042
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,519
certainly yeah you can find me at this

1043
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:13,358
medicinal genomics um that address and

1044
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:14,920
then um I think I put a substack up on

1045
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,078
this but there's the there's the

1046
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,480
preprint we have I'd start there I think

1047
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,880
the preprint has a good list of like

1048
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,838
what have other Regulators looked at in

1049
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,720
the Cannabis field regarding endotoxin

1050
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,000
what's in the tobacco field what are the

1051
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,959
what are the limits people have had in

1052
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,519
the past and um and our sort of first go

1053
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,159
at this and I I would caution folks we

1054
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,079
just started doing this in like November

1055
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:37,039
so we're by no means experts at this but

1056
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,280
we figured when the data came out like

1057
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,400
as loud as it was we like all right we

1058
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,240
gotta at least get this out there and

1059
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,920
let others know and see if anyone else

1060
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:47,078
can like tell us where we're wrong or

1061
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,599
which direction we should go so uh if

1062
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,599
others are interested in studying this

1063
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,720
like bring us up uh we're we're open for

1064
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:55,119
collaboration on this because uh this is

1065
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,039
something that is is kind of uh new to

1066
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,920
us at least in the Cannabis field

1067
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,960
uh and uh we're kind of interested in

1068
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,200
where this uh where this may lead so um

1069
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,519
feel free to drop us a note at uh you

1070
