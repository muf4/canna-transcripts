1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,160
[Music]

2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,359
kind of how attitudes from the major

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,118
sports organizations have changed when

4
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,160
it comes to cannabis and do you have any

5
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:21,160
thoughts of kind of what was the Tipping

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,599
Point yeah I do have I got a lot of

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,879
thoughts on a lot of things but um yeah

8
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,399
so that you know by them saying that

9
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,320
there we don't have enough evidence to

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:32,719
change our policies that is true and

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,119
they stuck with that the NFL did and it

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,520
was actually the players that were

13
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,320
pressuring them saying okay fine like

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,359
you keep saying you don't have the data

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,960
get the data then like figure out how to

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,719
get the data because you can't just keep

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,878
saying you don't have the data you know

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,079
that's kind of sometimes people will say

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,159
that as it's like an excuse to just keep

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,558
bad policies in place it's the same as

21
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,558
people saying there's no research

22
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,079
there's tons of research we have tons of

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,599
research that is already in the

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,840
published literature if you just look

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,359
like that it's the it's excuses or these

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,199
talking points right to just kind of

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,640
leave things status quo because it is a

28
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,359
very disruptive space because it's very

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,959
misunderstood because we have that

30
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,239
commercial industry too right a

31
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,798
recreational industry um but the NFL it

32
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,039
was the players that kind of pressured

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,920
them and again why are we so many years

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,880
later and we don't have the data and

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,960
that is true and I think one of the most

36
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,879
complicated things with cannabis and

37
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:28,118
getting that data is the funding because

38
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,399
really clinical trials are expensive and

39
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:32,200
so the people that are going to fund

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,680
clinical trials would be the people that

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,200
ultimately somehow would have some

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,560
benefit from seeing the results right

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,079
one way or the other now the NFL truly

44
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,359
does want the data what they do with it

45
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,039
is up to them we're just you know we are

46
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,519
just here to get the data um and it'll

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,759
be really interesting to see what they

48
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:52,239
do with the data because you know you

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,478
still have other people that are well we

50
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,519
need more data we need more data so so

51
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,438
it's hard to say but I think that

52
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:02,158
ultimately right now because of the

53
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:05,519
shift in the laws our countries the

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,080
society is Shifting and so the policies

55
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,560
that they have in Pro Sports and even I

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,959
mean the NCAA just removed cannabis from

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,519
their prohibited list because those

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,400
policies no longer align with Society

59
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,959
like Society is changing their laws and

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,439
so in order to have fluidity amongst the

61
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,280
game and the place of the game in

62
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,239
society the dysfunction it it was

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,080
starting to become too much and so I

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,120
think that was one of the reasons why

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,280
they were you know they got interested

66
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,439
in okay well let's see maybe we can put

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,959
up some funding and find people to get

68
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,719
the data then because you

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,080
know it's the amount of money you know

70
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,439
and yeah and there's a lot of drug

71
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,920
design for sure being done with

72
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,759
cannaboid molecules because the

73
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,799
scaffolding of how they work will it

74
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,639
will I mean we have data already to show

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,640
in animal models that there there is a

76
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,439
ton of effect there in neuroinflammation

77
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,919
neurod degeneration you know we know

78
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,680
that they are active there those

79
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,399
molecules are active there we know that

80
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,480
we now drug design has some complicated

81
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,280
things like you know bioavailability you

82
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,079
have to have reproducible dose you have

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,759
to have reprod you know and then the

84
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,480
canono system itself is very complicated

85
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,798
and so that's a whole different thing

86
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,439
but when you look at funding the

87
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,920
clinical trial it's who would put money

88
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,079
into that because with a product that's

89
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,079
available to everybody right now with no

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
prescription needed and it will continue

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,159
to be like that industry is not going

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,239
away so whose benefit is it to put the

93
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:37,120
money up to do the research and even in

94
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,799
the commercial industry they don't

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,920
actually need any data whatsoever to

96
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,920
shelf a product they don't need to show

97
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,079
pharmacokinetic data they don't need to

98
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,039
show bioavailability they don't need to

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,040
show anything they can package a product

100
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,639
and sell it as long as they're following

101
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,078
the Food and Drug compliance but it's

102
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,839
not an FDA approved thing so like

103
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,560
there's no incentive for them to fund it

104
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,158
because they actually don't need it they

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,799
can make an edible product and just put

106
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,759
it on the shelf and so It's tricky to

107
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,280
find anybody that it would even would be

108
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,399
interested in doing it so I think the

109
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,719
NFL like I applaud them really for doing

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,000
it because it shows that their minds are

111
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,000
at least Progressive and they're not you

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,560
know for a long time the conversation

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,560
about cannabis as a medicine just had

114
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,519
the breaks on like nobody wanted to talk

115
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,120
about it or try to understand it you

116
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,279
know and it's no different than any

117
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,840
pharmacological agent it it is bioactive

118
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,198
and it should be treated that way it's

119
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,879
just that in society we've chosen to

120
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,520
make it available to everybody and

121
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,199
that's a different conversation but it

122
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:40,439
is a plant and perhaps should never have

123
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,879
been prohibited in the first place right

124
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,918
right so why we are in this place right

125
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,199
now is a different conversation but it's

126
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,399
like how do we get out of it and so I

127
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,080
applaud the NFL for wanting to actually

128
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:54,519
see the data and putting up you know the

129
00:04:52,079 --> 00:05:00,918
call for research because it is not an

130
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:00,918
easy space to get funding for sure yeah

131
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:15,160
[Music]

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,160
a
