1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,039
okay so I'm paranoid of the voice of God

2
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:16,410
so I'm gonna be dashing through this

3
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:17,669
presentation so this is if you haven't

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,259
quite captured the power of

5
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:20,580
cryptocurrency hopefully this project

6
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:21,929
will sum it up a lot of people think

7
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:23,729
it's used for nefarious uses but

8
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,099
actually they're now funding scientific

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,230
purposes scientific projects their

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,960
funding charities all over the world and

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,509
- decided back in the in the spring time

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,520
to fund this project and what is this

13
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,628
project about well John gave a great

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,400
description what you can do with the

15
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:40,109
current genomes you can do a lot however

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,600
if you look around other plant genomes

17
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,759
that have much larger a much smaller

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,439
economic impact in cannabis their

19
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,989
genomes are much better shape than ours

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,280
the cannabis genome right now is in is

21
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,690
in horrible shape compared to these

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,030
things and it does create some artifacts

23
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,769
Philippe showed some artifacts where you

24
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,450
try and replicate markers and the

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,430
primers fall in snips and it doesn't

26
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,800
reproduce and we've seen this with a lot

27
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:03,390
of the vendors supplying sequencing

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,759
services as well that the things just

29
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,109
don't fully reproduce lab to lab we got

30
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,289
to changed that and the best way to

31
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:12,030
change that is to actually sequence the

32
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:14,009
genome to a quality of at least what the

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,049
human genome project had back in 2001

34
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:19,019
and the metric back then was to get to

35
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,600
about 500 KB and 50 what that means is

36
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,728
the average length of the sequence

37
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,339
contig in the assembly was about 500,000

38
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:27,840
letters this is not perfect this is we

39
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,579
want chromosomes that are hundreds of

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,228
millions of bases long that are

41
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:32,879
completely contiguous and completely

42
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:35,009
phased but this is the best we could do

43
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,989
back then nowadays I think you'll find

44
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,399
the hurdle rate for a good genome people

45
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:40,349
will say is if you're in the mega base

46
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,778
Club they want this n 50 number to be

47
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,489
north of a million bases and I'm gonna

48
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:48,718
show you how we pulled this off on the

49
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:50,339
Cannabis genome so there are several

50
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,078
reasons to do this that Jon touched on I

51
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,520
won't go very long we want

52
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,379
marker-assisted selection we want

53
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,700
accelerated breeding we want reliable

54
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,759
snip chips which I don't think you can

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,799
get off the existing references and we

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,478
we want to do this on as many genomes as

57
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,759
possible not just any one sort of

58
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,560
victory' genome we want a pan genome we

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,990
want type 1 genomes type two genomes

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,479
type 3 genomes type 4 type 5 you name it

61
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,299
hemp lines we really want 12 really

62
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,488
powerfully done genomes to make sense of

63
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:19,230
what's going on now some some

64
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,730
terminology here you're probably you

65
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,500
to hearing about context this is what a

66
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:24,268
normal assembly turns into a couple

67
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,919
hundred thousand of these and we really

68
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,780
want to get it into chromosomes like

69
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,699
this and there's a technologies from

70
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,408
phaz genomics impact bio that help do

71
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,969
this that we'll touch on but this is

72
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:34,560
really important for you to understand

73
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:36,419
where those chromosomes came from like

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,009
if they're in certain organelles or if

75
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,859
they're in certain microbes that often

76
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,628
contaminate genome assemblies so we

77
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,430
started off sequencing a jamaican lion

78
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:45,989
strain and this was a strain that I

79
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,730
selected mainly because it had some

80
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,560
impact on my father he was using type 2

81
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:51,539
strains but there was also some

82
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,829
controversy over IP and we figured let's

83
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,348
see if we can shed some light on that

84
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,819
and I also like teasing mark Lewis once

85
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:58,169
in a while and trolling him a little bit

86
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,298
so I decided that let's sleep on

87
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:01,949
something that that he may have bred I

88
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,159
think this is actually dates back to

89
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:08,578
2007 and there's some awards that won

90
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:11,489
and it is a type 2 plant and it looks as

91
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,870
if it is beta care off the lean dominant

92
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,569
a little bit immersing in there as well

93
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,459
these might vary based on conditions

94
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:18,869
this is all grown in a hydro to get rid

95
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,450
of microbes or at least to limit the

96
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,799
microbes but you can see the the the

97
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:27,328
reports down here in terms of the DH

98
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:30,930
it's about a 2 to 1 CBD to THC line so

99
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,760
how do we do this well - as Chuck just

100
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,959
described it consists of these master

101
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,459
node owners that are all over the world

102
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,019
that vote on how to spend their Treasury

103
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,180
and you submit them proposals and they

104
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,590
decide will this help us improve our

105
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,239
network and they're interested in

106
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,650
solving the banking problem in cannabis

107
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,180
industry and they saw this conference

108
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,599
and they saw this genome and said let's

109
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,189
do it

110
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,108
let's build the best reference in the

111
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,639
world and then we can maybe even build a

112
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,609
seed to sale tracking system that is

113
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,980
forensic in quality so they voted on

114
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,629
this in in June third and this is what's

115
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,729
crazy about the process is you submit

116
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:00,840
the the grant application we should

117
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:04,018
probably spend it a week before the

118
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,900
deadline and and by a week later we had

119
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,090
- in our bank ready to spend and were

120
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,189
able to kick the project off so this is

121
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,870
the summer time June third we started

122
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,759
you PCR screening for type two plants

123
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,989
this is little color metric ass that we

124
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,810
have that can tell you whether it's type

125
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,160
1 2 or 3 we all then went into Illumina

126
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,978
sequencing to screen for hetero zygosity

127
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,090
just pick a plant that had the less of

128
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,490
that because that would be better to

129
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:28,079
sequenced as a first genome and then we

130
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,389
got to go back to these old-school - the

131
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,740
tools of actually doing pulsed field gel

132
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,919
electrophoresis to get high molecular

133
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,050
weight DNA this is

134
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,790
really critical if you get DNA as long

135
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,020
as possible because the read lengths we

136
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,760
have now in these single molecule

137
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,490
sequencers can actually get out to fifty

138
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,170
to a hundred thousand bases and so we

139
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,610
chose to do this on the Pacific

140
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,470
Biosciences platform because it had the

141
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,699
highest accuracy there are some other

142
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,650
nanopores up there that have longer

143
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,879
reads for the accuracy right now when we

144
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:53,259
played around with that last year at cam

145
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,629
and we couldn't get those assemblies to

146
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,060
gel so we turn back to pack bio and look

147
00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:00,040
for higher accuracy reads and fed at DNA

148
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,230
that could actually get us these 32,000

149
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,420
base pair reads and we assembled this by

150
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,569
August third and put it public at about

151
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,720
a 650 KB and 50 so we beat the Human

152
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:12,879
Genome Project draft I should say in a

153
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,640
matter of a couple months 60 days from

154
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,129
getting funded to putting it public and

155
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,050
this isn't the end of the story we then

156
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,939
decided to team up with faze genomics to

157
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,040
turn this thing into a perfection genome

158
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,500
and what these folks do is they use

159
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,689
something called chromatin capture which

160
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,519
basically cross links the proteins that

161
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:34,149
are attached to the DNA and it tends to

162
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,529
mostly do that to inter chromosomally so

163
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:36,669
you don't get chromosome to chromosome

164
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,469
cross links as much as you get

165
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,120
neighboring DNA cross links and so what

166
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,860
you can get from this technology are

167
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,360
pieces of DNA sequence that are millions

168
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,100
of bases apart but are on the same

169
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,530
chromosome and then you can order up all

170
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,629
your chromosomes into pretty pictures so

171
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:52,359
we did 600 million high c reads like

172
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:54,490
this on Illumina to to get the high C

173
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,830
data together threw it into an assembly

174
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,009
and we ended up with a 5.4 mega base and

175
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:01,569
50 genome still not perfect but but you

176
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,490
know we're up above the mega base Club

177
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,079
but we realized you know what we really

178
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,670
want to get this into like the 50

179
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,800
megabase range so that we have full

180
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,290
chromosomes that are touching and we can

181
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,939
phase the genome so we went back and did

182
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,770
more PacBio sequencing on their latest

183
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,139
chemistry it's a version 6 chemistry

184
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:18,879
that does 42,000 base pair reads and I

185
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,229
think it can do longer this is probably

186
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,389
limited on the type in the quality of

187
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,340
DNA we gave them and it gave the

188
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,379
laboratory that was doing this you

189
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:28,569
really need to get that DNA as long as

190
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,279
you can so that you can maximize that

191
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,589
the throughput on these on these systems

192
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,750
so this one into another assembly a

193
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:36,819
falcon assembly and this raw assembly

194
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,560
unscaled it without any of the high C

195
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:41,170
data trying to glue the context together

196
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,629
came out at three times this one mega

197
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,000
base Club all right we're at 3.7 mega

198
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:46,269
bases of just the PacBio date alone and

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,730
that

200
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:52,449
fantastic to give you some perspective

201
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:54,009
on where that is in it slider so is she

202
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,139
where other historical assemblies were

203
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:57,730
and then of course we quickly uploaded

204
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,289
this into a preprint server because our

205
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,819
funding cycle is ending by the end of

206
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,620
October and we really wanted to have the

207
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,680
chapter closed on starting a funding to

208
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,920
end of funding we're gonna have a pre

209
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,230
printout that represents all this data

210
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,520
so what are these platforms Sara gave a

211
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,470
great talk in the other hallway and what

212
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,269
Pacific Biosciences is these are single

213
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,470
molecule sequencers so that trace you

214
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,029
see if there is actually a single

215
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,650
molecule going through a zero mode

216
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:22,209
waveguide with a polymerase that's

217
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,620
putting in fluorescently labelled

218
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:26,560
nucleotides and you are watching a movie

219
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,180
of a polymerase replicating DNA at a

220
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,639
single molecule levels absolutely

221
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,199
mind-blowing Star Trek stuff and they

222
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,430
can do millions of these wells at a time

223
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,319
which is which is which is fascinating

224
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,449
and then the other one is this this high

225
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,279
C approach that phase genomics was doing

226
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:40,750
and what this does is it really gives

227
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,069
you three-dimensional structures of the

228
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,870
genome because their genomes not these

229
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:46,209
perfect beautiful linear chromosomes

230
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,829
it's actually a big Gordian knot and

231
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:49,810
when you cross link that you end up

232
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:51,159
cross-linking certain DNA into certain

233
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,839
compartments of cells like the

234
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,250
mitochondrial DNA ends up in one place

235
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,519
and the chloroplast ends up in another

236
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,540
and then all of them might the the

237
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,709
microbial contamination end up

238
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,300
cross-linked in their own buckets

239
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:03,009
because they have they have nucleuses

240
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,540
and other cell walls that are kind of

241
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,879
constraining them so this helps

242
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,439
partition cells into the buckets that

243
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,209
the DNA actually exists in inside the

244
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,899
cell so you can do much more complete

245
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:15,519
and thorough assembly so this is one of

246
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,989
the first ones that we did and the most

247
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,609
I think the most remarkable thing about

248
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,990
this technique is that you don't need

249
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,250
high molecular weight do you need to do

250
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,410
this you take the tissue and you just

251
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,060
cross-linked it with formaldehyde and

252
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,070
then you chop the DNA up but once it's

253
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,810
cross-linked this huge loops of mega

254
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:30,279
bases apart get cut and you like ate

255
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,590
them and you're effectively reading the

256
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,120
ends of these large loops of DNA and you

257
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,680
end up building these maps and so what

258
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,090
the map that you have here is a contact

259
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,769
map it's one of the earliest ones that

260
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,180
we have so it typically you want to say

261
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,500
really bright line in the middle we're

262
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,179
not completely getting that yet with

263
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,460
cannabis because of the the repeat

264
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,379
content in it but it is bucketing now

265
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,300
into ten nice chromosomes which is what

266
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:52,149
we want to see we want to see chromosome

267
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:54,039
1 through chromosome through all the way

268
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,959
through the x and y chromosomes as well

269
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,669
and we want to see two of them all right

270
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,100
because the cannabis is diploid

271
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:01,419
most of the time and that's the neck

272
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,129
Faye's that we have to do no pun

273
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:05,379
intended is we have to then take this

274
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:07,480
diploid genome and split it into the two

275
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:10,000
maternal paternal chromosomes for every

276
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,430
one of them and then organize them

277
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,318
okay so just put the brakes on here and

278
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:16,508
look at what types assembly as we

279
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:18,698
traditionally have so back in 2001

280
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:20,589
John's group and our group played around

281
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:22,059
with assembling these some of these

282
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:23,800
genomes with Illumina data and they

283
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:26,138
ended up in hundreds of thousands of

284
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,479
pieces and the average contact size was

285
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,879
like around 3,000 bases okay

286
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,139
that's that's very small contig size

287
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,289
when you consider the human genome

288
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:37,389
declared victory on a draft at 500,000

289
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:38,828
bases and then many other people started

290
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:40,568
chipping and steep hill put out a really

291
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,969
nice assembly that then bumped this

292
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:44,469
number up likewise Philo's put one in

293
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,769
there and I think that the N 50 number

294
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,089
got up to 159 KB that was the longest

295
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,009
can most contiguous assembly and it was

296
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,839
on kin atomic which was a type 3 strain

297
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:54,669
so we weren't getting much information

298
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,050
out of the THC genetics from that strain

299
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:58,629
but it was still giving us great insight

300
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:01,120
into maybe the CBD genetics so then we

301
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:04,360
jumped on to Jamaican Lian and started

302
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,389
pumping these numbers up into the 648

303
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,519
region in the 665 region with just the

304
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:11,379
pack bio assembly alone and then when

305
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,959
they terminate when we top this off with

306
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:17,110
version six chemistry these numbers all

307
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:19,179
jump to 3.7 mega base and 50 results so

308
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,769
it's really we're really talking about

309
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:22,870
thousands of fold improvement over

310
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:26,019
contiguity from where we started in 2011

311
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:28,810
to what we have what we have today so

312
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:31,149
very fast response working with with

313
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:34,149
cryptocurrency folks say they they move

314
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:36,600
very quickly and it really helps to get

315
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:39,009
the public the data out there publicly

316
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
we did play around with trying to figure

317
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:42,188
out some aspects of this genome with the

318
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,149
existing assemblies we had we published

319
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:44,948
a preprint that we never really

320
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,589
converted into a paper because it just

321
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:49,899
opened up this onion of confusion once

322
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:52,389
we did this we we did we did PCR

323
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,828
amplification of THC synthase with two

324
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,759
different primer sets and some primer

325
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:56,620
sets that were described in the

326
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:59,019
literature from a group name from the

327
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,060
Onofre paper we're sitting right inside

328
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,500
the gene so when they amplified this

329
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,758
they were the primers were sitting on

330
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,438
the start and stop codon and they're a

331
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,000
little bit blind to the variation in the

332
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:07,958
start and the stop codons and that's

333
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,879
going to mean something in a minute

334
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,099
but you'll see when we amplify with

335
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,450
those Onofre primers we amplify a lot of

336
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,920
copies and we don't know where they

337
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,210
the genome we just amplify them in

338
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,860
sequence them and we know that they're

339
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,870
unique copies because they have high

340
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,340
confidence polymorphisms between them

341
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,299
but we don't know the order of them in

342
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,379
the genome and I don't know where they

343
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:24,639
go in the genome and we don't

344
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:26,590
necessarily know if they're fully active

345
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,149
in the genome we just saw there's a lot

346
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,460
of those copies we then backed those

347
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,500
primers out to amplify with more unique

348
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,389
regions in the genome and we started

349
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,919
getting much fewer genes that were

350
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,970
coming through and the ones that were

351
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,319
coming through seem to all be

352
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,670
full-length there weren't any stop

353
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,660
codons in them and they looked as if

354
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:44,259
they were really good

355
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:46,419
th-these in face context now when you

356
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:48,370
get a good genome reference this is what

357
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:50,289
happens is they all show up in a tandem

358
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,120
array so interestingly enough THC

359
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:54,129
synthase has replicated itself almost

360
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,590
like it's kind of skidded across the

361
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:58,720
genome and so here's one region and one

362
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,940
contact that has five different copies

363
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,070
of THC synthase but they're all mutated

364
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,540
substantially in fact I don't even know

365
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,280
if we want to call some of these th T's

366
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:08,829
in face because they're mutated probably

367
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,569
they're probably only 85% identity and

368
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,040
then likewise you can look at another

369
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,780
con take that is the one that contains

370
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,399
can have a chromium synthase now we know

371
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:18,549
that this thing actually is for tandem

372
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,720
copies about 30 or 40 KB apart and you

373
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:21,969
probably can't see this but there are

374
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,920
some mutations in the three prime end

375
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,050
and the 5 prime end that changed the

376
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,459
amino acid structure such that primers

377
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,329
probably missed this in the past because

378
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,610
they would haven't placed on those

379
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,379
sequences theirs happens to be two more

380
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,820
copies of this and another content in

381
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:35,529
the genome that's now been linked by the

382
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,030
hi-c data so there's actually six copies

383
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:39,250
of this thing and they're all slightly

384
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,110
diverged and we don't know if they fold

385
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,759
at the same rate or if they maybe fold

386
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,409
some of the other rare cannabinoids that

387
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,759
these need to be cloned and expressed

388
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:47,559
and a lot of the work that John's done

389
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,669
on this gene needs to be repeated with

390
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,919
maybe some of these and that some of

391
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,959
these variants this is how many we're

392
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:54,669
finding that have at least 80% identity

393
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,259
there's 30 different DNA sequences and

394
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:57,729
this is a cladogram of them and the

395
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:00,370
scaffolds that they're sitting on on the

396
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,750
genome so we can see there's a lot of

397
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,970
cannabinoid diversity cannabinoid

398
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,230
synthase diversity and then if you if

399
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,580
you kind of Whittle those down and say

400
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,139
well which one is a really full-length

401
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,400
and possibly functional because some of

402
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:12,009
these are so mutated maybe they're just

403
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,350
they're just pseudogenes and we get down

404
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,669
to it about 18 of these different THC

405
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,290
synthase jeans that look like they're

406
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,219
they possibly could be in actually

407
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:20,230
encode for something that's a

408
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,310
full-length don't know what they do we

409
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,840
need to be teaming up with people that

410
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:24,938
can probably clone these express them

411
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,829
and get more information on

412
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:29,688
now in terms of assay development as

413
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:31,849
Philippe was touching on this is what we

414
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:33,980
were dealing with before is that this is

415
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,959
a mapping to the references that were

416
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,339
made back in 2011 and if you're not

417
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,708
careful when you map to these genomes

418
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:40,939
these blue reads are paired reads that

419
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,258
means they're Illumina reads we have a

420
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:43,938
forward and reverse read and they both

421
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:46,159
map to the genome the thing highlights

422
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:47,629
it blue red and green are ones where we

423
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,828
can only map one of the reads to the

424
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,539
genome and not the other and so

425
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,008
something's wrong and those ones you

426
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,688
should always kind of discount us with

427
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,509
and I should trust them but even with

428
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:58,039
these blue ones you can see paired reads

429
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,688
there are four snips in here that

430
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,238
probably don't really exist and what

431
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:04,428
this is when you map these same reads to

432
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,619
Jamaican lie and you see that those

433
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:08,539
reads then map to those other genes that

434
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:10,009
we just found that are tandem and so it

435
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:11,568
cleans up a lot of your mapping it

436
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,789
cleans up a lot of your polymorphism

437
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:15,349
discovery and now we have a reference

438
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:17,088
where we can actually maybe go ahead and

439
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,339
make a snip chip out of this and not be

440
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,949
confusing all the signals that that we

441
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,929
might get out of the chip so phase

442
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:25,519
genomics then stepped into this to try

443
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:27,798
and phase the genome which is using this

444
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,869
hi-c stuff to peel apart the maternal

445
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:32,688
and paternal haplotypes so that we can

446
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,309
have a perfectly phased genome and when

447
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:35,778
they run this through a bus going now

448
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:37,909
I'm starting out of busco but this is a

449
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:40,129
cost analysis it looks at how many

450
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:42,769
pieces of the genome you have it's it's

451
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:44,298
up in the 800 range there and you can

452
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,818
see the end 50 numbers are getting

453
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:48,110
closer to 5.4 mega bases the more

454
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:50,448
complete genomes a little bit more 80

455
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,369
rich I don't have time to go into this

456
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:53,899
we are publishing this on - and what

457
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:55,999
that means is we're using an incentive

458
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,339
I'd review system to speed it up we

459
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,139
select 3 3 reviewers we end up putting

460
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,209
out a cryptocurrency bounty for doing

461
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,589
the review and everything every

462
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,998
communication they do ends up getting

463
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,100
hashed onto the blockchain so it's

464
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:09,678
completely censorship resistant and

465
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,778
transparent so the phasing stuff is

466
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:13,308
tough right this is what typical genomes

467
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:16,428
should look like as it should have two

468
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:18,828
different copies of this of this genome

469
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:20,688
and then what typically happens is

470
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:22,159
genomes get collapsed if they're not if

471
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:23,599
they're really homozygous like humans

472
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,948
they get collapsed into one copy they

473
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,999
can't discern the material from the

474
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:27,678
paternal because there's only a snip

475
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:30,168
every hundred bases mean or every

476
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:32,088
thousand bases we wanted we wanted to

477
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:33,828
tease those apart and you do this with a

478
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,449
program called purge applet eggs which

479
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:37,068
looks for coverage differences among the

480
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,389
contexts rips the ones that are high out

481
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:39,279
of the

482
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:41,319
sure and then you can begin to zip these

483
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,709
things into even better maps and we have

484
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,710
here and if you add in bigger data from

485
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,230
PacBio these things turn into this mess

486
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,580
now this is actually not a mess it looks

487
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,070
like a mess for you but actually we're

488
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:57,100
seeing here is the numbers that popped

489
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,870
out of this 475 mega base in 50 contexts

490
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,029
this means we have perfect chromosomes

491
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,590
that are all sorted now there might be a

492
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:03,879
couple gaps in between the scaffolding

493
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,110
from high C which we can fill with a

494
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,600
couple other programs that they're

495
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,340
recommending like Polar Star and another

496
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,230
tool that helps to connect those things

497
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,879
called PB jelly and we're in that

498
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,409
process right now to just now polish

499
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,299
these things and fill the gaps but I

500
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:18,459
think it's safe to say that we now have

501
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:21,279
a genome that is better than most of the

502
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,930
other agricultural crops out there and

503
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,220
this is just more statistics I won't

504
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:25,569
bore you with but what the future is

505
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,639
going to hold is we have a cross of this

506
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:30,220
going on so we can get a tree oh it's

507
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:31,750
with its brother and what we're gonna do

508
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,269
in the future is a lot more methylation

509
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,710
sequence a lot more RNA sequencing and

510
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:37,090
we're gonna do some more trio work and

511
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,280
maybe build some some really powerful

512
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,660
snip chips so I want to thank all these

513
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,159
people involved there's a lot of

514
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:43,959
volunteers that jumped into this project

515
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:48,029
and made this work and I should leave

516
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,030
some time for a question or two thanks

517
00:16:52,769 --> 00:17:01,210
please come up to the mics and ask any

518
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,850
questions hey Kevin thanks a lot for for

519
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:06,009
the talk I do have a question you

520
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,949
mentioned the the repeats on on the THC

521
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:11,890
and cannabinoid synthase and I think you

522
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,300
probably saw a lot on Turpin synthesis

523
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,300
can you comment a little bit on

524
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:17,859
oh thank you for bringing it up so we've

525
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:19,389
done a little bit of looking into the

526
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:23,319
terpene synthase genes as well to be

527
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,490
honest luca and and keep a Lynette steep

528
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,448
hill have been digging it a little bit

529
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,680
more we've got a kind of a little

530
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,089
community here that I know that you're

531
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,920
involved with that they're staring down

532
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:32,230
that they're remapping all of John's RNA

533
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,509
sequencing data onto the new assemblies

534
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,970
and the terpene synthase cluster is even

535
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:39,390
bigger there's many more of those to

536
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,390
work through

537
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:50,690
I this I'm kind of new to this does this

538
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:55,519
mean anything of value can be sold or

539
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:57,140
distributed to anybody or everybody are

540
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,240
you referring to the blockchain side of

541
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,220
this or or the Cannabis sequencing is

542
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,279
out of this if I have a photograph of

543
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:09,400
Jimi Hendrix does that mean it can be

544
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:12,680
somehow quantified into some massive

545
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,330
distribution or so there are there are

546
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,269
things going on on the theorem network

547
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:19,699
where people will get art and hash it

548
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:21,019
onto aetherium and you can get certain

549
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,029
number of digital copies that are

550
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:26,029
verifiable so that that art is

551
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:27,889
effectively scarce digitally if you will

552
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,299
and there's some unique attributes the

553
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,630
music industry that that plays a role in

554
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:37,490
but I think I'm getting a getting the

555
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:39,020
god light coming up on me over here so I

556
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,509
think with this we're going to turn this

557
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:43,400
over into a more Q&amp;A with the panel to

558
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:44,930
talk about medicinal cannabis and I

559
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,250
would like to invite all of our

560
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,250
panelists up for this this event
