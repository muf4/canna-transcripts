2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,240
value of the the study that you're doing

3
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:20,359
is to try to identify what are those

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,799
good ratios and make sure that they're

5
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,679
available to people in other states

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,839
because I know that's not the case

7
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:31,079
everywhere you they might not have sort

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:34,519
of that high CBD low THC ratio like in

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,159
some some states uh it's just all THC

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,480
you're lucky if you find any CBD so I

11
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,439
think that's that would be a great

12
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,319
benefit of of this work is to really

13
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:46,479
figure out what that good ratio is and

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,238
inform the the industry yes that's one

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,000
of the things I'm really grateful I

16
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,479
because I'm independent uh I don't I'm

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,119
not uh like full-time employed by

18
00:00:53,479 --> 00:01:00,038
anybody just me ask nurse Laura and I I

19
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,119
love that I get to work uh because

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,838
because with with nursing I can work in

21
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,959
in other states and talk to companies

22
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:10,359
and talk to

23
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,399
uh researchers about about the different

24
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:15,840
products also in the hemp space and and

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,920
what what's out there that we're seeing

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,759
as beneficial and where are those gaps

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,719
what's missing and to educate people on

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,438
how to be a smart um hemp consumer even

29
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:29,000
like how to to find a reliable hemp

30
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,158
company um thankfully in our Network we

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,799
have some good people that would have

32
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,359
some good products but there also is a

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,000
lot of garbage out there I did a secret

34
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:42,159
shopper campaign in the state of

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,759
Delaware and and for for hemp shops and

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,118
it was kind of scary what we found and

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,718
and it's a lot because it's not so

38
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,718
regulated

39
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,959
um so I just want to encourage people to

40
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:58,879
do their homework and and uh learn how

41
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:01,239
to dig into the details not just trust

42
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,039
you know like Google review use and and

43
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:05,478
not just trust a handshake you know we

44
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,439
need to know what we're getting what

45
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:09,560
we're putting in our body because even

46
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,919
if today it doesn't cause a negative

47
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,360
effect uh some of the the things that

48
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,479
might be in some of these products might

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,200
cause issues down the road that we don't

50
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,840
even know about yeah no that could be a

51
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,958
whole that could be a whole other

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,439
podcast and actually I think we should

53
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,039
do that uh I think it's really

54
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,120
interesting and um it was one of the

55
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,159
things I was going to ask but then I

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,840
remembered that you know that the study

57
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,239
is restricted to getting products from a

58
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,159
dispensary because I was curious you

59
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,640
know are people using hemp diive

60
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,759
cannaboids or sort of these synthetic

61
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:45,039
canabo like delta8 THC or some of these

62
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,959
other things for ptst I think that would

63
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:51,878
be interesting uh maybe a later

64
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,120
study yes yes we we you know well maybe

65
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:54,959
you don't know but when you're trying to

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,158
get approved by an

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,280
IRB it is an independent review board it

68
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,519
it's a lot of work and there are a lot

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,360
of specifics that you have to follow and

70
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,000
and we're trying to do everything like

71
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,720
this is our first study we hope to do so

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
many more research projects uh but you

73
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,840
have to do something to get off the

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,598
ground and so we had to find ways to

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,239
sort of level the playing field just a

76
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:22,399
little bit sure and we do have um

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,360
regulations so there's a a group called

78
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,519
uh canra the Cannabis Regulators

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,439
Association that brings together

80
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,158
cannabis Regulators from multiple States

81
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:33,840
uh and they talk and and hopefully at

82
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,438
some point we're going to have some more

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,840
standard across the country that's one

84
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:41,359
of the challenges that that I find is is

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,878
standards from state to state

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,720
accessibility from state to state it it

87
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:50,239
really is challenging and uh to to take

88
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,120
the time to figure out what the

89
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,519
regulations are like what what are the

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,920
standards in this state uh especially

91
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,920
for business owners so I have a contract

92
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:02,679
with Bright View Assisted Living because

93
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,318
they want their uh residents to be able

94
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,599
to access cannabis and utilize cannabis

95
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,158
in their facilities some of these people

96
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,078
are this is the end of their life is

97
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:13,598
going to be in this facility they want

98
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,560
them to have a good quality of life they

99
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:19,839
operate in eight states up and down the

100
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,600
east coast and even in the states they

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,239
all have medical programs but they have

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,840
different rules and different products

103
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,319
in each of their programs and trying to

104
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,079
standardize a policy and standardize

105
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:35,079
implement ation for them it is really

106
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,079
challenging

107
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:50,689
