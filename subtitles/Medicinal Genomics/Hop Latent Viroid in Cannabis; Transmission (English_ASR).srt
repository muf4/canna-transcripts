2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:15,298
all right

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,640
I'm testing everything's coming back

4
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,800
negative everything is great okay but

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,600
now I'm finding oh no a few plants over

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,300
in this corner now they're infected

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,880
should I do more testing to make sure to

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,859
kind of mitigate this spread somehow or

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,140
well if it's surely if it's a definite

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,079
positive I would I would move it out I

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,520
would move it into another room and then

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,500
decide what you want to do don't leave

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,700
it there now

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,939
um it's interesting because I haven't

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,640
seen any data yet to suggest that the

16
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,679
viroid moves very effectively you know

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,939
down down the road for example if if

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,738
somebody's walking

19
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,839
you know they say with your clothes

20
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,939
brush up against the plant I don't know

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,100
that that is sufficient damage to the

22
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,920
leaf to to move properly it does for

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,420
many viruses and thyroids but there may

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,219
be data out there but I haven't seen it

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,600
yet and the reason I say that is because

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,519
I'm you know being I've walked into

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,739
facilities where they've got a few

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,359
infected plants here then everywhere if

29
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,879
this thing was moving with with people

30
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,219
brushing up against the plants every

31
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,199
damn plant in that location would be

32
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,478
infected and that's not the case we're

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,820
finding isolated spots Here There and

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,959
Everywhere that may have been introduced

35
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:27,359
through a a pruning tool sap sap the

36
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,919
movement of sap is super important so

37
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,859
when you brush up against a plant there

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,978
really is no sap coming being released

39
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:38,219
or or on your clothes that's gonna react

40
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:40,679
on a wound on another plant but sap on

41
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,359
your tools and sap on your gloves so

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,340
you've got obvious sap stuck to your

43
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,379
gloves and you touch another plant and

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,240
you damage it that will transmit it

45
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,938
damage is the key

46
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,640
the tissue has to be damaged usually I

47
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,258
think that it has to be the vascular

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,420
system has to be exposed in other words

49
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,879
there has to be a broken vein or a

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,280
broken off leaf that allows that Viral

51
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,500
to to enter in I think just putting the

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,420
viroid on the surface of a leaf and

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,759
letting it sit I don't believe is going

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,080
to cause an infection so you got to have

55
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,779
the wounding and you've got to have the

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,520
sap and water so these plants could have

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,580
picked it up if there was recirculating

58
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,580
water that has the viroid in it and and

59
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,860
somehow got into root contact and then

60
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,200
of course the viral is spread within the

61
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,420
uh within the plant so recirculating

62
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,339
water is a problem because

63
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,159
I haven't seen any treatments yet that

64
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,759
work so even 100 degrees Centigrade

65
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,579
heating doesn't do it uh UV doesn't do

66
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,979
it fluorination doesn't do it I don't

67
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,980
know yet what treatments could be made

68
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,419
to water to clean it up recirculating

69
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,979
water yet I mean there's there's

70
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:49,378
obviously a lot of companies working on

71
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,539
that and eventually we'll have an answer

72
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,919
but right now you have to be super

73
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,620
careful with water that's being

74
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:59,159
recirculated from an infected infected

75
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,819
mother or plant wow yeah that that seems

76
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,039
that seems like a massive issue now

77
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:07,259
in terms of that so in addition to

78
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,359
testing plants you should you should be

79
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,919
testing your water and your surfaces

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
your equipment things like that as well

81
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,818
yeah so

82
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,439
um definitely if you're recirculating

83
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:18,958
and you know you've got a high incidence

84
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,878
of hot blatant you're almost guaranteed

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,680
to to have it in the in the

86
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,658
recirculating water now we got to

87
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,360
remember it's not pure water that has

88
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:29,399
the viroid it's little flakes of small

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,560
pieces of roots and organic matter and

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,780
debris that's come off the roots that's

91
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,920
left off that's carrying the thyroid in

92
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,539
it

93
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,280
um and so when the water is recirculated

94
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,818
they're still it's still got a little

95
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,318
bit of particles and stuff in it that

96
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:46,378
potentially has the has the thyroid in

97
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:48,598
it we've seen it on surfaces on for

98
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,399
example on flood tables so if there's a

99
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,500
plant that's sitting on a table and and

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,360
there's water you know up against the

101
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,818
roots on the bottom you can find hot

102
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,340
latent on the surface of that table as

103
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:02,158
well as of course on tools for that

104
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,158
cleaning bleach does a pretty good job

105
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,439
or or work on two percent because that

106
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,120
comes in direct contact with with the

107
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,039
water or the you know the film of water

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,560
that's on the table

109
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,259
um it can eliminate hot latent viral

110
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,798
quite effectively on on tools and on the

111
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:22,439
on the surfaces of tables but in terms

112
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,299
of what does it do to sap if there's

113
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,879
infected sap

114
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,978
um I don't know how effective work on or

115
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,079
bleach are at this stage where you've

116
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:33,000
got visible sap being moved from plant

117
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:36,240
to plant whether whether those two

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,759
chemicals will completely eradicate uh

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,860
the viroid but for surfaces there's

120
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,580
definitely materials out there that will

121
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,360
work

122
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,359
excellent
