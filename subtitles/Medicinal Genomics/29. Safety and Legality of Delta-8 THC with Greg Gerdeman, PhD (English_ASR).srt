which brings me to today's guest dr greg

87
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
gerdeman

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,959
greg gerderman is a neuroscientist and

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,439
educator with experience in the

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,560
physiological actions of cannabis

91
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,919
and the endocannabinoid system recently

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,878
greg has gotten involved in the

93
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,598
conversation around delta 8 thc

94
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,359
which is how i met him coincidentally

95
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,598
enough we met through the canmed

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,360
community facebook group

97
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,959
i explained how that happened at the top

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
of the interview so i won't

99
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,360
retell that story here but the takeaway

100
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,759
is that you can meet some very

101
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,920
interesting people in that group

102
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,399
okay i'll stop plugging the facebook

103
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,280
group down and get back to greg

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
he comes at the delta eight thc topic

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,959
from a neuroscientist

106
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,798
perspective questioning how much we know

107
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,280
about delta 8 thc

108
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,680
and how it affects the body in the brain

109
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,680
he also raises important questions about

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,080
how the compound is created

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,159
and what that means for consumer safety

112
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,439
and the legality of delta 8

113
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,239
thc products in our conversation we

114
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,519
discussed

115
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,239
what exactly is delta 8 thc and how does

116
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,080
it differ from

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,878
other thc isomers why there is a sudden

118
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,519
influx of delta 8 thc products

119
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,319
how the 2018 farm bill opened the door

120
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,199
for delta 8 thc production

121
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,839
the process for creating delta athc from

122
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,360
cbd

123
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:30,319
isolate and the risks associated with it

124
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,040
whether delta 8 thc is a is actually

125
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,478
produced in the plant and at what levels

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,639
what research has been done to

127
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:40,159
understand how delta 8 thc

128
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,600
affects users and more before we get to

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,560
um greg you were quoted in that article

175
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,478
and coincidentally enough

176
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
i had a question about one of the

177
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,519
comments you made made

178
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
a comment on the post and you responded

179
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,599
to it right on the

180
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:30,079
canmed community facebook group so a

181
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
shameless plug for that group um if

182
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,639
people

183
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,318
people should definitely join that as

184
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,000
you can see you can

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
communicate with a lot of leaders in the

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,279
space and make some great connections so

187
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,279
again i'll put a link in the show

188
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,599
description for that but anyway i'll

189
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,279
stop

190
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,960
rambling and we'll get into that

191
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,559
question that i asked a little bit later

192
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,000
but i think we need to really

193
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,800
start with the basics here for people

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
who aren't familiar with delta h thc

195
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,199
and uh i'm going to pass that over to

196
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,360
you greg can you explain to us a bit

197
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,478
what it is and why is it in the news

198
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,639
lately sure

199
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,959
and it's especially in the news that is

200
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,840
is generated by and about the cannabis

201
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,758
industry so far but it is going to be in

202
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,839
broader news and that's something that

203
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,960
that everyone needs to take

204
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,359
serious because there are risks and and

205
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,399
and issues related to how this could

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,280
affect

207
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,560
health and the industry what is delta

208
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,478
thc

209
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,680
you know everyone is familiar with delta

210
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,800
9 thc

211
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,519
it's the workhorse psychoactive

212
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,079
component in cannabis and you know for

213
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,560
for

214
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,000
decades delta 9 thc was considered the

215
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,360
only active

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,439
principle because that was sort of the

217
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,479
state of affairs and you know back in

218
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,478
the 60s

219
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:44,878
when when delta 9 thc was isolated

220
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,598
it was found to replicate you know all

221
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,360
the important

222
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,598
sort of behavioral and psychological

223
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,520
effects of of hash oil

224
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,878
and um other cannabinoids were

225
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,159
discovered back then

226
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:00,319
including delta eight but were not

227
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,120
believed to have that kind of potency

228
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,319
so delta eight thc is an isomer of delta

229
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,360
nine it has

230
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,960
a very similar chemical structure to say

231
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,560
it's an isomer means it has the same

232
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,239
number of carbons and

233
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,879
other atoms but there's a difference in

234
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,918
one

235
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,280
bond between two carbons in the molecule

236
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,639
and the position of that

237
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,559
double bond is in these different deltas

238
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,319
delta nine has it in one place delta

239
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
eight has it next door

240
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,560
and there are other isomers delta six

241
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,080
delta seven delta ten

242
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
all it means is the placement of that

243
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,759
bond shifts which

244
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
is not a very impressive change just

245
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,038
looking at the molecule

246
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,680
but it does have some functional

247
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,439
differences

248
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,559
sort of maybe the next question is like

249
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,279
where is delta 8 coming from

250
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,000
it has long been known that delta 8 can

251
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,519
be seen

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,559
in analyzed extracts of cannabis flower

253
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,480
so it's it's there it's found

254
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,359
naturally it is also discovered way back

255
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,879
in the 60s

256
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:10,560
that that delta 9 and even

257
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:12,720
cbd could change to delta 8 thc

258
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,079
under certain chemical conditions

259
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,879
especially low ph

260
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,879
acid conditions so this has been known

261
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,799
for many years that

262
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:26,000
for example cbd can convert

263
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:27,838
to thc and that's really what's

264
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,600
happening right now

265
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:35,680
in the industry delta eight thc is being

266
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,040
lab synthesized this reaction to create

267
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,199
delta eight from cbd has been

268
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,958
developed in different labs and it's

269
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,160
being created from

270
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,559
cbd isolate as a starting product

271
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,079
is that making enough sense for how

272
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,479
we're going yeah that is making

273
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,000
sense um so now that we know kind of

274
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,519
what it is

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,039
why is it popping up so much in the

276
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,799
marketplace now

277
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,639
right it there's i look at two

278
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,719
uh watershed moments here that have

279
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,838
caused this delta eight

280
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,759
to pop up in the form of uh

281
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
at the consumer end in the form of gum

282
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,879
ease and other edibles

283
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,879
and vape cartridges people have

284
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,240
concentrated d8 that they're doing

285
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:23,720
in like dabbing um

286
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,039
where's it coming from well you know in

287
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,720
2018

288
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:31,919
there was the uh farm bill the news

289
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,959
version of farmville that was written in

290
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:38,240
past to really help advance a legalized

291
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,759
hemp industry and of course we've got

292
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,079
this long

293
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,200
you know winding relationship with what

294
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,559
we call cannabis

295
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,600
and hemp is now legally defined

296
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,199
based on its thc content and it has to

297
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,920
be 0.3 percent

298
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,278
delta 9 thc or less and if it is it's

299
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,479
considered hemp

300
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:03,200
and under the 2018 farm bill hemp

301
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,120
is not a controlled substance well

302
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,440
that farm bill did several things one

303
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,919
thing is it opened a real

304
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,120
rush of interest into growing hemp

305
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,559
extracting hemp

306
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,480
creating cbd there was a rush for that

307
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,239
and it was overproduced it was overgrown

308
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,759
a lot of farmers got nowhere near the

309
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,759
return they hoped

310
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,759
a lot of extraction companies had far

311
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,078
more competition than they thought

312
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,519
there was a glut of cbd on the market

313
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,958
and the price of cbd

314
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,440
fell dramatically so you had a situation

315
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,639
where

316
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,160
folks investing and going into this hemp

317
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:43,120
extract cbd industry

318
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,159
suddenly you saw their margins shrinking

319
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,839
dramatically

320
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,679
because the price of cbd isolate was

321
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,360
falling so much

322
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:54,159
um well at the same time

323
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,320
the the farm bill when it said that hemp

324
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,159
is not a controlled substance

325
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,920
the language of that bill which many of

326
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,879
people have dug into

327
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:06,000
says that extracts and isomers and

328
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,320
derivatives thereof

329
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,639
extracts from extracts and derivatives

330
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,240
of legally defined hemp

331
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,680
are also considered hemp and therefore

332
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,440
unscheduled removed from the dea's

333
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,439
purview

334
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,839
although it also says that it

335
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,760
synthetically

336
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,519
synthetic cannabinoids synthetically

337
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,200
manufactured cannabinoids i forget what

338
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,399
the exact language was

339
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,079
was not made legal by this

340
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
this is where there's a lot of tension

341
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,078
but these two things to answer your

342
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,200
question these two factors converged

343
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,919
where the price of cbd fell like a stone

344
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,639
and there was a legal loophole that made

345
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,319
some

346
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,039
enterprising chemists realize hey cbd's

347
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,560
cheap now i'll buy hundreds of kilos of

348
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,759
it and we can

349
00:12:52,559 --> 00:13:00,159
start working in the lab to

350
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:02,399
convert it to thc delta eight thc

351
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,559
which isn't delta nine so if we come up

352
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,320
with a delta eight product that is less

353
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,439
than point three percent delta 9

354
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,839
it'll be legal and it also does get you

355
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,720
high

356
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,920
and it has effects that have consumer

357
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,040
value and

358
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,199
so the price of cbd dropping and this

359
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,599
perceived legal loophole that says if

360
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,360
it's not delta 9 it's fair game

361
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,480
led to this chemistry it led to this

362
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,360
development

363
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,920
and it led to a return of really high

364
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,839
profit margins for people who were

365
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,000
pursuing this and that drove an

366
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,639
explosion of entry into the field there

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,198
are

368
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,600
dozens and dozens of labs that are

369
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,799
buying cheap cbd isolate

370
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,440
and making delta eight products and

371
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,120
because it is a huge regulatory vacuum

372
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,800
right now

373
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,879
these products are popping up everywhere

374
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:56,479
vape stores gas stations

375
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:59,120
hemp shops certainly online direct sales

376
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
etc well that's part of the issue too

377
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,078
right that

378
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,959
these products are popping up everywhere

379
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,519
from

380
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,919
any number of different manufacturers

381
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,159
not all of whom are probably

382
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,759
uh reputable or knowledgeable in what

383
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,838
they're doing and how

384
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,879
can the consumers sort of tell the

385
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,519
difference or at least protect

386
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,439
themselves

387
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,919
if like you said there is that

388
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,600
regulatory vacuum

389
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:27,198
i mean to me the real issue is it is

390
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,879
pretty much that um that be honest i

391
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,679
mean the the end consumer at a vape shop

392
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,559
or a store

393
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,879
another retail outlet they generally

394
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,359
have no idea i mean you can see

395
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,000
i've seen delta eight products with

396
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,360
really slick clean looking packaging

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,919
and branding um that is

398
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,159
very dirty you know and that there's my

399
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,559
concern and by dirty i mean

400
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,198
it's not i'm not out on a crusade

401
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,039
against delta 8 thc a molecule

402
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,639
there has been a very limited clinical

403
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,360
experience with it

404
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,480
but delta 8 thc was studied in the early

405
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,600
90s in a

406
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,240
small clinical trial for kids with

407
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,440
pediatric cancers and were undergoing

408
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,320
chemotherapy

409
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,639
and in this small study delta eight thc

410
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
was

411
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,919
very well tolerated and helped them

412
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,600
through the nausea

413
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,198
of their chemotherapy so there's a

414
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,519
potential therapeutic use

415
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,639
no surprise because delta nine and cbd

416
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,799
both have

417
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:30,720
good anti-nausea effects

418
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:34,879
but my concern is what else is in there

419
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,320
and you can go to a lab

420
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,480
you can send your product to a lab

421
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,199
testing you know company

422
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,480
and get a certificate of analysis a coa

423
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:43,758
that people in the field are very

424
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,759
familiar with

425
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,039
and and you can test it and see here

426
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,839
here are the cannabinoids that are

427
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,599
present

428
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,440
here are maybe terpenes if they're

429
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,360
looking at that

430
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,440
quality control issues like residual

431
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,800
solvents and pesticides and metals

432
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,199
you can test for that but a lab doesn't

433
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,039
test for i mean doesn't show you things

434
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,439
that they don't look for

435
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,719
and there are in these delta eight

436
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,959
products a variety of

437
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,680
molecules that you see if you're looking

438
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,159
at the raw data on these lab

439
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,758
analyses there are a number of

440
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:22,000
components in there

441
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:26,399
reaction products that are unknown

442
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,759
and um there's a concern

443
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,278
for for the risk of unknown molecules

444
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,399
unknown products so this this comes to

445
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,879
another real for me

446
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,440
crux of the of the issue that i think is

447
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,600
sort of an

448
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,959
existential moment in the hemp cannabis

449
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,079
industry about

450
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,958
that that how we relate to this balance

451
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:49,278
between

452
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:52,638
natural or created within the plant

453
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,559
and lab synthetic

454
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
call it semi-synthetic if you want this

455
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,119
is a touch point because the dea says if

456
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,879
it's synthetic it's not legal

457
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,959
in my view i'm not trying to make their

458
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:06,640
argument for them but in my view as a

459
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:08,639
biologist and chemist pharmacologist

460
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,559
if you have a starting product and an

461
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,240
ending product that are different if you

462
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,240
convert something into a different

463
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,679
molecule whether it's an isomer or not

464
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,679
it is a synthetic process

465
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,679
and as i said it's acid conditions that

466
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,918
are the

467
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,919
that form a big catalysis to this

468
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,519
cyclizing reaction that basically if you

469
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,519
look at the chemical structure of cbd

470
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,279
compared to thc you can see how there's

471
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:39,519
kind of a loop that's not closed

472
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:42,960
in cbd and when the molecule is under

473
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,558
reactive conditions though some of those

474
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,519
loose ends and the oxygens in the

475
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,798
molecule want

476
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,599
to form partners and the easiest

477
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:51,839
quickest thing

478
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,719
for that to happen is the loop closes on

479
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,319
itself

480
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,440
and cbd closes that ring

481
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,119
and becomes a tetrahydrocannabinol and

482
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,679
at that moment

483
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,439
where the ring closes wherever that

484
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,720
double bond is

485
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,759
it kind of gets stuck and and that's why

486
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,440
the same reaction that creates delta 8

487
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,519
thc

488
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,600
can't create delta 10 or delta 7 or

489
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,558
these other

490
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,159
isomers there's another subtlety that

491
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,720
gets a little more

492
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
for the chemistry sort of intelligentsia

493
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,880
but

494
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,360
there's there's uh

495
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,520
racemic or enantiomers that get formed

496
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,399
too the position of hydrogens like on

497
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,679
one side

498
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,840
left hand or right hand side of the ring

499
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,120
that flips around and changes too when

500
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,759
you've got cbd

501
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,359
converting to thc in this reaction and

502
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,519
my point here is that

503
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,918
although there are subtle differences

504
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,759
you get not only delta eight thc but

505
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,480
kind of like four different

506
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,200
varieties subtly different varieties of

507
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,480
delta eight

508
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,840
delta 9 popping up when you

509
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:05,519
create it under this laboratory

510
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,519
catalyzed chemical reaction

511
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,120
does that create in and of itself a big

512
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,640
safety concern

513
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,199
you know i'm not particularly that

514
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,520
scared of it i'm more scared of things

515
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,160
like

516
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,480
aggregates that happen if the reaction

517
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,400
is uncontrolled

518
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,079
where the cbd molecule doesn't just

519
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,679
close on itself it closes on its

520
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,079
neighbor for example

521
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,960
you get longer larger molecular weight

522
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,798
molecules

523
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,160
that's not cleaned up i would never ever

524
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,759
vape it it could be something that

525
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,880
sticks in your lungs

526
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:38,480
and and is unhealthy

527
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,520
um so that's others so that's what you

528
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,240
mean by

529
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,519
you know the labs not not finding what

530
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,759
they're not looking for

531
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,119
is that yes yeah because they are

532
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,798
looking at the metals and

533
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,558
all these other things that are sort of

534
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,400
you know commonly tested in the

535
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,678
in the cannabis space but since it's

536
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,480
going through this

537
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,798
um synthetic process that's not being

538
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,640
done

539
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,000
in cannabis they're they may be missing

540
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,720
things is that right

541
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,159
yeah yeah they may well be missing

542
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,640
things and there are labs doing this

543
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,960
that

544
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,759
that again i'm not trying to rag on the

545
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,519
really good

546
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,158
chemists that are trying to pioneer this

547
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,759
space but there are others that

548
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,440
don't even have the sophistication to

549
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,400
know what i'm talking about at this

550
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,159
moment

551
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,919
um and and that that concerns me

552
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,679
um you know these reactions a good

553
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,280
chemist will know or we'll find out as

554
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,919
soon as they start looking into this

555
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,558
that all of this should be done under a

556
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,840
stream of

557
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,639
nitrogen gas that's inert uh and and

558
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,279
helps

559
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,960
the sort of runaway oxidation reactions

560
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,240
from happening

561
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,558
but if you don't you're going to get

562
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,679
more side effects if you cook it too hot

563
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,200
you're going to get

564
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,880
these different aggregates forming and

565
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
some of that can be cleaned up with

566
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,799
filtration

567
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,519
but to really clean it up and get delta

568
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,599
eight as a

569
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:58,480
as a pure molecule you requires

570
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,480
expensive product development r d with

571
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,480
techniques of chromatography that is to

572
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,000
say separation of the molecules that are

573
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,798
in there

574
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,759
that are not cheap and a lot of this

575
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,400
industry is just

576
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:13,519
chasing huge profit margins and they

577
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,038
will cut those corners and they do

578
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,879
and it's it's something where the good

579
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,879
players really ought to be inviting some

580
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
level of regulation

581
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,919
you know and and even testing for metals

582
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,759
and pesticides and such

583
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,520
you know there aren't national standards

584
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,759
for you know

585
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,599
how those things are implemented and

586
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,599
this applies to the cbd industry at

587
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,918
large i've seen many cbd

588
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,038
products that seem to have laboratory

589
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,559
coa laboratory coas that are

590
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,558
you know bogus you know so and i think

591
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:50,480
that that's a problem in delta eight

592
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:53,038
big time um cannabis has long

593
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,159
had an issue of lab shopping right we

594
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,640
want our

595
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,159
or our cannabis to have a higher thc

596
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,640
content and this lab we know

597
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,640
favors it that product is super

598
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,440
magnified in delta eight

599
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,679
and part of the reason is the very

600
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,720
technical point i just raised that you

601
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,600
get

602
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,000
different sort of small flavors of thcs

603
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,798
formed

604
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,919
these different subtle enantiomer

605
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,440
differences because people who are used

606
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,240
to looking at this chemistry

607
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,000
when you're doing a lab analysis you

608
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,599
basically get a readout that looks like

609
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,480
peaks right on a chart and

610
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,439
those peaks on the chromatogram are

611
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,038
theoretically

612
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,720
you know individual molecules if you

613
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,319
separated them out cleanly enough

614
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,480
every molecule would have its own little

615
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,000
peak well

616
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,000
if you're trying to move quickly in a

617
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,240
lab and you run your react you you do

618
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,679
that separation in a fast time

619
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,159
then you don't get much separation

620
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,320
because of the way that synthetic delta

621
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,159
eight thc and i will refer to what's out

622
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,558
there as all synthetic because to me

623
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,840
that's what i think it is

624
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:04,240
but lab converted synthetic delta a thc

625
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,519
because it has these subtle differences

626
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,798
the the peak for delta 8 or delta 9

627
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,798
is going to be wider and more

628
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,319
less precise because there's actually

629
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:15,359
three or four different varieties that

630
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,720
are in there that move

631
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,719
subtly different well how do you know

632
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,279
how much delta 9 is there to find out if

633
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,319
you're still

634
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,119
legal you run it against a known lab

635
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,639
standard

636
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,519
that lab standard is going to have a

637
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,120
very sharp precise peak

638
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,119
what happens in a lot of these delta

639
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,199
eight products is even when they're

640
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,319
testing for delta nine

641
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,798
right where that lab that that standard

642
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,798
peak is that's nice and sharp

643
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,400
it looks like okay there's only point

644
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,679
three percent there

645
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,360
but labs can sort of conveniently ignore

646
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,320
that there's a lot that the peak is

647
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:55,519
broader there's more there

648
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:58,158
and for example

649
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,119
some good labs and i i refer now to dr

650
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,360
chris udall

651
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:05,199
at proverity labs

652
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,879
he he's insistent that he's tested

653
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,159
thousands of delta eight products that

654
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,720
are out there on car

655
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,440
on in commerce and that none of them are

656
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,360
under point three percent delta nine thc

657
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,960
because the delta nine in these products

658
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,119
are also

659
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,319
synthetically generated from the cbd

660
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,278
reaction

661
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,960
and you're underestimating how much

662
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:28,079
delta 9 is there

663
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,600
and in in practicality i've heard this

664
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,720
talked about because of my buddies that

665
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,959
are

666
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,880
that are making this or that are buying

667
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,720
delta a distillate and diluting it into

668
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,760
tinctures or putting it into gummies you

669
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,159
know

670
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,000
again i'm not in a crusade against these

671
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,440
friends and others like them who are

672
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,480
trying to make a good

673
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,000
you know business out of this but you

674
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,599
know i've been told by a friend in this

675
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,440
business oh man you know i had this

676
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,879
product and like one lad told me it was

677
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
point three percent and the other said

678
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,039
it was like

679
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,759
six percent so there's

680
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,278
there's another piece where like i'm not

681
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,919
scared of cannabis right i think

682
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,000
cannabis

683
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,278
should be regulated and legal i think

684
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,558
people should be able to grow it in

685
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,720
their backyard

686
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:11,119
and i think that we need to have mature

687
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,278
open marketplaces about this

688
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,519
but there do need to be regulations and

689
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,240
because of this mystique and gray area

690
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,720
and market rush with delta eight among

691
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,480
the

692
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,558
many issues i've got some problem with

693
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,480
is just truth in advertising

694
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,319
you know i've gone to shops where delta

695
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,640
eight gets sold as

696
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,558
you know it's it gives you the high of

697
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,679
thc but not the anxiety

698
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:38,079
it won't get you too high it's thc light

699
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:40,240
and again if you had pure delta athc

700
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,000
the a good bit of the evidence that's

701
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,919
out there from especially from animal

702
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,159
studies is that it's not as potent as

703
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,799
delta nine maybe three quarters maybe

704
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,400
two thirds is potent

705
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,759
although some studies have found it as

706
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:57,120
potent some from the early 70s

707
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,200
and and you hear user reports on that

708
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,439
but i've also heard many user reports of

709
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,759
people that thought oh delta 8 is

710
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,519
lighter and safer and have ended up

711
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,919
consuming way too much of it

712
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,599
even experienced pot users that go into

713
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,640
that anxiety hole

714
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,639
and i'm concerned about the users who

715
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,559
aren't familiar with it and yeah you

716
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,799
know i'm not a

717
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,399
run save the children sort of fear

718
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,158
monger but

719
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,000
teenagers shouldn't be able to buy this

720
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,278
at a gas station thinking like it's

721
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,599
something that's just going to take the

722
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,038
edge off and not get them high

723
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,319
well most of them know it's going to get

724
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:30,960
them high that's why they're doing it

725
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,000
right

726
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,519
right anyway i'm getting a little bit

727
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,038
loose with it while we yeah so i was

728
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,440
going to ask i mean

729
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,158
why the focus specifically on delta 8

730
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,919
thc

731
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,760
as you mentioned there are other isomers

732
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,038
of delta 10 delta 6.

733
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,798
why is delta 8 more desirable than those

734
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,839
others

735
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,440
i think delta eight it was just the

736
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,480
low-hanging fruit

737
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,120
um as far as how it's popped up

738
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,880
delta eight uh emerges and and maybe

739
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,119
we'll get to your question that we

740
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,400
that introduced us in a moment from what

741
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,000
i'm about to say

742
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:13,440
because even if you've got a cannabis

743
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,400
extract or a cbd a hemp

744
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,000
extract with high cbd and you're

745
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,399
distilling it down

746
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,440
to make say a cbd oil and enrich cbd oil

747
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,678
for a tincture

748
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,919
full spectrum product or to take it into

749
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,640
isolate

750
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,919
putting that cbd rich extract in a in a

751
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,240
distillation vessel

752
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,000
and cooking it down if that's run too

753
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,278
hot or too long you get delta 8

754
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,398
appearing

755
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:42,720
that isomerization does happen even

756
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:46,000
without artificially lowering

757
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,960
the ph as is being done now to make it

758
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,038
more effective

759
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,558
so delta eight and again and delta

760
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,240
eight's been known like i said there's

761
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,158
not a vast literature but

762
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,558
there were people doing some human

763
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,320
studies with it in the early 70s

764
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,079
there were people doing some animal

765
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,960
studies with it pharmacology

766
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,798
studies in the 70s and 80s there was

767
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,159
that one clinical trial i mentioned in

768
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,000
pediatric

769
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,320
patients for the control of nausea

770
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,480
associated with chemotherapy

771
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:18,960
and delta 8 does have psychoactivity

772
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,558
but you do have these other isomer i

773
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,759
mean i think it's critical to be talking

774
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,158
about it right now

775
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,319
because i mean i could put up a picture

776
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,080
of cbd with all of the different

777
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,639
products that can be formed with

778
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,960
fairly simple reaction conditions some

779
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,720
of them are called iso thcs

780
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,798
which definitely do not get formed in

781
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,399
the plant but do get formed when this

782
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:42,240
chemical reaction is

783
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:45,918
catalyzed in acid cooking it up an acid

784
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,240
delta 10 may even be easier to form

785
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,000
um this is one that you know there are

786
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,558
delta ten products out there right now

787
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,119
people are

788
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,798
calling that like the the next thing and

789
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,278
my question is why

790
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,798
like i have a phd in pharmacology

791
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,278
focused on cannabinoids

792
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,079
although i think it's safe to say very

793
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:03,679
few people

794
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,240
in the planet had a cannabinoid

795
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,640
pharmacology phd before i did i

796
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,839
this was from 2001 when i finished my

797
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,520
work i've never stopped studying the

798
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:15,678
subject pharmacology is the question of

799
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,720
how drugs interact with the body

800
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,559
and i don't know what delta 10 does it

801
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,798
really hasn't been studied

802
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,398
and there's a there's a sort of an

803
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,480
anecdote out there

804
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,158
that delta tens emerged into this

805
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,919
marketplace

806
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,760
if this emergence came just a couple

807
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,240
years ago because uh or catalyzed

808
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,240
because

809
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:40,640
a cannabis farm in california

810
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:43,599
was impacted by the wildfires and they

811
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,120
had a cannabis harvest a bunch of flower

812
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,199
that was sprayed down with flame

813
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,398
retardant

814
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,798
and for whatever reason and i'm not

815
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:52,079
going to

816
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,038
drop the name of this because i'm not

817
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,599
sure how true the story is

818
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,440
they started analyzing to see well can

819
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,918
we extract the retardant out

820
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,519
anyway this has been this is the problem

821
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,880
of the kind of thinking that goes on in

822
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,759
this unregulated market

823
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,919
not oh crap this is ruined it's got

824
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,599
chemical flame retardants all of it

825
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,038
well people have investments in this

826
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,678
it's their livelihood they're like well

827
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,240
there's a lot of chemistry going on now

828
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,080
can we try to just extract that out and

829
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,319
get rid of it and not if it doesn't

830
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,599
show up in the final product then we're

831
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,439
good right

832
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,519
well that what was in the final product

833
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,200
included a lot of delta 10.

834
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,839
they didn't know why but something about

835
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,519
that chemical flame retardant

836
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:38,079
pushed that reaction to occur um

837
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,918
so there's an opportunism straight up

838
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,599
and i'm not trying to be

839
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,000
judgmental in a bad way i mean drug

840
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,278
development follows opportunistic routes

841
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,319
too

842
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,079
uh it does the

843
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,439
one classic example that just pops to my

844
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,558
head is like rogaine

845
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,558
minoxidil that's used for for you know

846
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,678
male pattern baldness and stimulate hair

847
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,599
growth

848
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,759
that was a drug that was being tested

849
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,798
for cardio like uh blood pressure

850
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,440
control

851
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,798
and as a side effect it grew hair and

852
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,919
the drug developers

853
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:11,679
were like hey maybe let's put this into

854
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,720
a topical and see if it can grow

855
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,840
hair on bald men so opportunism isn't

856
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,399
bad

857
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,959
but in that controlled industry there's

858
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,319
a great deal of what's called

859
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,519
pharmacovigilance you have to follow up

860
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,240
and you have to show

861
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,960
that it's safe in the world of

862
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,960
pharmacovigilance

863
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,000
an example that pops up is vioxx

864
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,759
selective cox inhibitors that

865
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,679
were developed because they don't cause

866
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,919
gastric bleeds as much

867
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,679
but it turns out they caused cardiac

868
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,480
related fatalities

869
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,880
well those fatalities occurred at like 1

870
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,679
in 10

871
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,679
000 or something now it was taken off

872
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,320
the market for good reason

873
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,840
but that wasn't detected until a lot of

874
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,200
people were using it

875
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:59,439
unfortunately and if

876
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,319
the cannabis and hemp space is going to

877
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,679
go into

878
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,678
laboratory based synthesis

879
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,600
even if it's just a one chemical step

880
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,440
conversion

881
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,798
you do get reaction products that you're

882
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,759
not looking for

883
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,000
and it needs to have oversight and you

884
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,759
ask

885
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,519
a great question why focus on delta

886
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,158
eight well now because it's everywhere

887
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,399
and it's the

888
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,679
mo it's the molecule the moment and it's

889
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,798
not going to go away because it's got a

890
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,440
lot of use

891
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,000
but delta tens coming out other deltas

892
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,600
other

893
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,319
cannabinoid variants like thcv

894
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,519
which definitely is created in the plant

895
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,359
in some

896
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,038
genetic lines of the plant some

897
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,558
varieties of cannabis

898
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,079
create these so-called propyl

899
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,639
cannabinoids i'm fast

900
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:45,599
i'm very interested in those but you can

901
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,960
cook them up in the lab using

902
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,678
cbd as a starting point you can i know

903
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,240
kim i have

904
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,798
seen conversations between chemists who

905
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,679
are

906
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,319
working on their protocols to make the

907
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,640
cannabinoid thcp

908
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,240
from cbd as a starting material what is

909
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,480
thcp

910
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,759
that was only just discovered early last

911
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,640
year or reported by italian researchers

912
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,319
who described this new phytocannabinoid

913
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,278
and the only reason it was a big

914
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,079
splash is because it's supposedly 30

915
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,919
times more potent than delta 9 thc

916
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,759
there are chemists right now trying to

917
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,080
iron out their protocol

918
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,919
where if they can start with cbd isolate

919
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,839
that was hemp derived

920
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,960
and make it thcp in an efficient way

921
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,119
then they're going to go through the

922
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,159
same loophole and say it's hemp it's not

923
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,319
controlled

924
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,159
and that's obviously a race for profit

925
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,798
margins because it's not what the intent

926
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,039
of the law

927
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:42,639
is and i think we need to have mature

928
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,919
conversations about this

929
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,840
or there's going to be possibly toxicity

930
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,320
effects in the population public health

931
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,319
concern

932
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,079
possibly a massive flow back on the

933
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,600
industry that just turns this into

934
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,798
an enterprise controlled by big pharma

935
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,599
and if we're not talking very

936
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,759
transparent about how to move forward

937
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,879
in the industry regulated way then

938
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,398
there's going to be

939
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,599
potential for real problems so

940
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:16,559
how open really is this loophole

941
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,440
um you know is what folks are doing

942
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,960
converting

943
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,440
cbd to delta 8 thc

944
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,878
is that technically legal or are they

945
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,480
kind of playing with fire here and it's

946
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,239
only a matter of time before they get

947
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,159
cracked down on

948
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:34,158
well i will say that i'm not a lawyer

949
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,079
i will also say that i have seen

950
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,398
well-heeled and respected lawyers come

951
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,000
on

952
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:42,638
both come down on both sides of that um

953
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,679
in my view as a pharmacologist who has

954
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,838
studied this

955
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,200
quite closely i think that it's not

956
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:51,679
legal delta 8 thc

957
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,719
is explicitly listed as a schedule 1

958
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,079
substance

959
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:59,519
at this point in time it is also

960
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,960
una to me as a as a

961
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:06,159
as a scientist it is unequivocally a a

962
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,119
analog of delta 9 thc it's as

963
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:12,319
close to delta 9 thc as you can get and

964
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,519
because delta 9 thc is still schedule 1

965
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,200
the analog act of like 1985

966
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,719
in my view clearly includes delta eight

967
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,279
so i think

968
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,480
it's kind of a double dose of schedule

969
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,359
one illegal

970
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,960
the dea sees it that way the association

971
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,598
of food and drug officials

972
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,800
who writes model code for the fda seen

973
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,160
it that way

974
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,519
i believe the fda sees it as as illegal

975
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:41,358
again delta nine thc shouldn't be in

976
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,759
schedule one the whole schedule one

977
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,960
status has never ever been based in

978
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,040
science and

979
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,039
you know as we're moving towards

980
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,279
wrapping up this conversation i mean i

981
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:55,039
think it's important to point out that

982
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,519
all of this stems from the absurdity

983
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,480
of cannabis policy i am someone who

984
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,039
believes

985
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,480
that human beings have not only a

986
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,358
natural right to cannabis

987
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,719
but seeking the psychoactivity and

988
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,119
therapeutic

989
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,239
medicinal effects of cannabis is as

990
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,280
natural

991
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,598
a behavior as you can get the the

992
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,560
cultural social religious evolution of

993
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,320
human beings

994
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:23,358
has been wrapped up in a dance with the

995
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,559
selected you know cultivated evolution

996
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,838
of the cannabis plant

997
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,719
right it's a huge fun fascinating story

998
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:31,519
the long

999
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,118
cannabis human relationship it's as

1000
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,759
natural as can be

1001
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,720
to seek out the use of natural plant

1002
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,960
cannabis

1003
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:42,639
and the fact that it's prohibited

1004
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,400
has never been based in science it's

1005
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:48,159
been contrary to human

1006
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,280
medical history and it's led to things

1007
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,239
like super

1008
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,800
high thc content and breeding it's

1009
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:58,959
leading to

1010
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,960
seeking avenues for that experience

1011
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,639
whether it's therapeutic or for just for

1012
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,599
the mental effects because you want it

1013
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,000
that are are less natural and i have no

1014
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,000
problem

1015
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,358
saying that how delta eight and these

1016
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,480
other isomers are being made

1017
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:18,559
is less natural um

1018
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,880
maybe we move forward where you know hey

1019
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,320
cannabis is cannabis we'll call this

1020
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,880
cannabis

1021
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,880
but we need to have those discussions

1022
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,920
and all this stems around having an

1023
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,838
unhealthy over-regulated prohibited

1024
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,119
status of cannabis

1025
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,960
and that's

1026
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,240
yeah i guess that's kind of a mic drop

1027
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,039
moment because i'm not sure where

1028
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,239
that's where i end up yeah well i did

1029
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,079
want to ask you too

1030
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,759
and and you mentioned that you know the

1031
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,400
way that delta h thc

1032
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:53,040
is being produced now is unnatural but

1033
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,000
is there a potential for the plant to be

1034
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,719
naturally

1035
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,280
making delta eight thc and perhaps you

1036
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:02,959
know breeders selecting for that or

1037
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,119
um you know can create a more natural

1038
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,240
product you know that's a that's a great

1039
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,160
question i

1040
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,358
and i've talked i talked to one friend

1041
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,078
who's

1042
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,759
again i won't name drop but he's been a

1043
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,599
very very influential

1044
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:21,119
um infamous cannabis breeder uh

1045
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,119
in in the world and and has studied the

1046
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,960
chemistry of extracts quite a lot

1047
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,200
and he told me he didn't think delta 8

1048
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,199
is real at all he thinks even the trace

1049
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:32,559
amounts that's been found

1050
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:35,118
is a artifact of dissolving the stuff

1051
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,880
in order to put it in chemistry to

1052
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,838
analyze it

1053
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,440
i bounce that off of another friend who

1054
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:45,440
is

1055
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:49,760
very well known in in cannabis medicine

1056
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,440
um who says that uh i mean

1057
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,200
so this was ethan russo i will drop his

1058
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,200
name because i don't think he would shy

1059
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,799
away from this ethan thinks that delta a

1060
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,598
can be made in the plant

1061
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,760
that he has seen analysis of varieties

1062
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,200
in europe that seem to reliably have

1063
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,680
higher levels

1064
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,439
and you know he's i pitch his name

1065
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,440
because he is involved in a group called

1066
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,119
breeder's best and he

1067
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,960
they have interest in breeding for delta

1068
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,400
eight um i have no

1069
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,960
idea where i don't know how delta eight

1070
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,240
occurs

1071
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,838
in the plant um you know you asked me i

1072
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:22,239
will give a shout out to the question

1073
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:23,759
that

1074
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,679
brought this conversation together

1075
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,880
because you said you know

1076
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,960
dr g like if if your definition of

1077
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,640
synthesis is cbd is one thing and it

1078
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,760
turns to delta eight that's another so

1079
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,719
it's synthetic

1080
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,000
what about the decarboxylation reaction

1081
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,399
because the plant makes

1082
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,599
cbd a dhca and when we heat it

1083
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,240
it converts to the neutral form thc as

1084
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,519
we know it

1085
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:52,239
cbd as we know it it's a very astute

1086
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:55,159
question these are different molecules

1087
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:57,039
but in my mind the what we the

1088
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,960
decarboxylation that happens the

1089
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:02,480
activating that happens

1090
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,119
is it certainly absolutely occurs in

1091
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,719
nature

1092
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,200
when the plant stays out in the field

1093
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,919
and it's got uv radiation and heat

1094
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,679
that decarboxylation happens so whether

1095
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,800
it's made in an enzyme or not it's

1096
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,719
clearly made with

1097
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,560
happens in the trichome of the plant if

1098
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,838
it's you know in the field long enough

1099
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,159
to happen

1100
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,239
i also see it as a thermodynamic

1101
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,679
inevitability

1102
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:28,318
cbd will always break down to cbd

1103
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:29,199
given just enough time and warmth and

1104
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:31,679
heat to

1105
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,399
bump the reaction over you don't have to

1106
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,279
get it

1107
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,039
to hundreds of degrees and that's the

1108
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,319
point where it's at equilibrium and it

1109
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,400
all shifts over

1110
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,480
but you know it all it all will move

1111
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,119
over just like a bowl of water sitting

1112
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,159
at

1113
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,680
on a 70 degree day will all evaporate

1114
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:48,318
even though it never hits its boiling

1115
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,039
point

1116
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,960
cbd a is all going to go to cbd

1117
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:56,159
eventually

1118
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,838
that said you know thc is eventually

1119
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:01,440
going to break down

1120
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:03,838
delta nine it's more uh

1121
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,079
thermodynamically favorable to turn into

1122
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,838
delta eight delta eight is more stable

1123
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,280
i suspect that's how it's coming in the

1124
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:14,318
plant is some fraction of delta nine

1125
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,560
which degrades into cbn right

1126
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:17,759
some of it will shift into delta eight

1127
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,000
first

1128
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,119
i'm so i'm skeptical that we can breed

1129
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,119
for high delta eight

1130
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,680
but i would love to see it i think high

1131
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,720
delta eight flower would be fascinating

1132
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,239
um and i again because i will

1133
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,799
fall back on an argument for whole

1134
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,799
plants because i think that the

1135
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,240
chemical phenotypic diversity of the

1136
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,440
cannabis

1137
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:43,279
genus is just so utterly remarkable

1138
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,760
that if people want a lighter high

1139
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,119
then let's focus on breeding type 2

1140
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,680
plants that have

1141
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,240
under 10 percent thc and a nice balance

1142
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,960
of cbd there's so much potential that i

1143
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:58,318
think the industry should focus on

1144
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,599
i think that the route of hey let's

1145
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:05,039
let's chase good margins by taking just

1146
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,680
bulk cbd and processing it in labs

1147
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:10,000
it's giving some applied chemists work

1148
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,559
and i'm not against that

1149
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,079
but i think it tilts the agriculture

1150
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,759
towards a monoculture

1151
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,480
that is not creative that is not

1152
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,800
celebrating the diversity of this plant

1153
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,639
it also creates you know if you're going

1154
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,720
to do it that way then why not just

1155
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,159
work on making more and more greater

1156
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,318
efficiency with

1157
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,279
you know transgenic yeast to spit out

1158
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,400
cannabinoids

1159
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,359
which again is not a you know

1160
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,680
i'm not criticizing that as some sort of

1161
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,719
ignoble adventure i mean i've met really

1162
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:40,159
smart

1163
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,159
cool people who are trying to make

1164
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,000
cannabinoids out of yeast

1165
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,679
but if that's what we're doing is making

1166
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,838
a molecule

1167
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,639
i think that the diversity we're at a

1168
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,759
point in history where the diversity

1169
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:56,559
of cannabis can be explored far

1170
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,480
greater than it ever has been before and

1171
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,279
i want to see that happen i want to be

1172
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,000
involved with ventures that support that

1173
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,720
and there's going to be room for all of

1174
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,358
it

1175
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,118
the derivative stream of hemp is going

1176
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:09,838
to include everything from graphene

1177
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,440
batteries

1178
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:16,639
and you know hemp crete to

1179
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,519
cannabinoid molecules and that's going

1180
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,598
to take

1181
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:23,679
chemical processing it needs to be

1182
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,119
something that's done transparently

1183
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:31,199
that's regulated in a way that you know

1184
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:34,318
clean potentially risky products

1185
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,279
risky manufacturing let's not forget

1186
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,440
that putting

1187
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,160
reaction vessels at pressure with high

1188
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,599
acid is a dangerous thing to work with

1189
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:47,199
if there's no oversight then

1190
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,680
somebody that bought cheap cbd isolate

1191
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,358
can cook it up and risk themselves their

1192
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,519
environment

1193
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,519
and also a plug i never put in there but

1194
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,559
just on the this question of like

1195
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,920
what's in there all of the conversation

1196
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,078
that we assume is that

1197
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,039
you're starting with a very pure cbd

1198
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,200
isolate

1199
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,318
if your starting product is dirty in the

1200
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,399
first place

1201
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:09,440
then these unknown reaction products are

1202
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,480
going to multiply

1203
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,280
you don't know what's in there yeah

1204
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,639
so delta 8 maybe there will be delta 8

1205
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,720
plants in the future i

1206
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:19,838
weight that and find a great interest in

1207
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,199
it um

1208
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:24,480
but maybe not i'm not sure yeah and you

1209
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,199
make a great point

1210
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,400
about um you know if you're looking for

1211
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,118
a lighter high

1212
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,920
why are there not more type 2 type

1213
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,160
plants

1214
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,079
or products available and i can just

1215
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,440
speak personally from up here in

1216
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,760
massachusetts

1217
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,358
uh if you go to a recreational

1218
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,760
dispensary

1219
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,639
it's rare if you ever find anything

1220
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,760
that's not

1221
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,759
a straight type one plant and

1222
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,359
you know you ask people why why is there

1223
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,640
not more variety here and

1224
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,358
you know they say that that's all the

1225
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:57,679
growers want to grow um

1226
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,598
and i think that there is just a there

1227
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:00,000
could be a wider market for people to

1228
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,079
have

1229
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,559
a more balanced experience um

1230
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,119
but uh it's probably just going to take

1231
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:09,279
time

1232
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,880
for people to realize that i think it's

1233
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,680
going to take time it could happen

1234
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,838
we could be on the cusp of that um but i

1235
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,199
agree i've seen dispensaries

1236
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,159
where i've you know found a really

1237
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,439
lovely

1238
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:26,639
you know like outdoor grown type 2

1239
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,679
variety that i thought

1240
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:32,159
man i could use this all day

1241
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,919
you know and i'm not a heavy consumer

1242
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,719
and and

1243
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,358
i like that i think that there's great

1244
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,480
future

1245
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:43,519
in those for the sort of

1246
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,480
wellness aspect and those who like the

1247
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:49,838
experience but don't want to get

1248
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,639
feel inebriated by it

1249
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:54,000
i think there's huge future in it and if

1250
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,639
that's what's driving the

1251
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,159
but i think there's a lot of you know i

1252
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:01,279
think a lot of what's driving the delta

1253
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,679
8 market is a so-called legal high

1254
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,359
i think it's one step away from sort of

1255
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,000
the illicit

1256
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,880
mentality of the spice sort of market

1257
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,599
the only difference is potency

1258
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,160
and for that reason i think that these

1259
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,599
synthetic

1260
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:19,759
pathways i see them as

1261
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,760
not actually a legal loophole i've

1262
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,640
advised multiple companies

1263
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,480
yet you might i'm not a i'm not an

1264
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:27,679
economist i'm not someone who chases a

1265
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,199
fast profit

1266
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:30,719
maybe you're going to get where the

1267
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:33,519
getting is good

1268
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:35,679
but i wouldn't invest a market strat a

1269
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:38,639
business plan in delta 8 because

1270
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:40,318
i think that that the justification for

1271
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,440
it being currently illegal

1272
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,599
is just too strong

1273
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,720
because of the synthesis the synthesis

1274
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,160
of a delta 9 analog

1275
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,598
all right well i do want to be mindful

1276
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,358
of your time i know i kept you over the

1277
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,119
half hour a bit

1278
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:56,400
before i do let you go i want to give

1279
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,119
you the opportunity to

1280
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,480
plug any websites or social media that

1281
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,240
you're involved in that

1282
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,800
people can connect with you gosh i'm i

1283

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,280
and my instagram is

1285
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:14,719

1286
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,720
g-a-n-j-a-n-e-s-h if you plug that

1287
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:19,039
and it's kind of personal stuff but i i

1288
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:21,838
comment on the industry i'm at um i can

1289
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,920
be found on facebook

1290
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,159
i've got a few different ventures i mean

1291
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,079
i have a a license for a medical

1292
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:28,719
cannabis dispensary up in weirton west

1293
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,519
virginia

1294
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:33,279
called weir wellness that's

1295
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,838
underdevelopment

1296
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,079
i'm with a cbd hemp company called

1297
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:42,239
tennessee pharmaceuticals with an ftn

1298
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:43,760
pharmaceuticals.com also very new i'm in

1299
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:45,759
transition

1300
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,760
and i'm i'm really i'm getting involved

1301
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,119
in an exciting venture that's relevant

1302
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,880
to all this that i

1303
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,039
can't even really talk about too much

1304
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,318
yet but it involves

1305
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:59,358
wanting to [ __ ] to create a better

1306
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:01,800
transparent open marketplace for hemp

1307
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,480
and cannabis derivatives where there is

1308
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,240
authentication of the chain of custody

1309
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,480
and the various validations and

1310
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:11,519
certifications that go on

1311
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,280
because right now the world of

1312
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,199
buying and selling these cannabis

1313
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,960
derivatives like distillates or

1314
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:20,000
biomass even um there's they're huge

1315
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,000
trust issues

1316
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,920
there are huge transparency issues and

1317
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,480
i'm involved with a venture that

1318
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:31,838
is going to try to help be a solution

1319
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,440
for those uh to to have a greater open

1320
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:34,960
market exchange so

1321
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,079
that doesn't really give people a plug

1322
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,760
to look for a specific site but maybe to

1323
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,280
keep their eyes open or if that if

1324
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,960
somebody's mind

1325
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,640
pops when they hear that and thinks oh

1326
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,599
my god that's exactly like my tech

1327
