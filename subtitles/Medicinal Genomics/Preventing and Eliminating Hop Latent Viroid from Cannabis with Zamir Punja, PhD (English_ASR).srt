on the cam Med conference

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,378
on this episode I had the pleasure of

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,600
speaking with Dr zamir punja zamir is a

12
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:45,179
professor of plant biotechnology at

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,760
Simon Frazier University in Canada

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,679
his research interests include the

15
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,558
etiology and management of plant

16
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,640
diseases on vegetable and Horticultural

17
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,339
crops

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,020
in the applications of biotechnology for

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,480
disease management

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,879
since 2018 his work has shifted to

21
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,039
researching on cannabis where his group

22
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,039
has described a range of previously

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,740
unreported pathogens affecting the crop

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,020
and has evaluated various methods of

25
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,359
disease management zamir's latest

26
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,219
research has been focused on a pathogen

27
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,920
that is spreading throughout cannabis

28
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,679
cultivation facilities worldwide hop

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
latent viroid

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,140
hlvd as it's also called is a relatively

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,659
new pathogen it was first identified in

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,420
hops in the late 80s and we've just

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,880
detected in cannabis in 2018.

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,859
it is also quite small only 40

35
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,739
nanometers in size

36
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,259
still in just five years this tiny

37
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,839
pathogen has managed to infect as much

38
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,400
as 90 percent of cannabis facilities in

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,040
California alone

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,340
all while reducing yields as much as 50

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,640
percent and costing the industry four

42
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,820
billion dollars in losses

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,819
zamir shared his latest research on hlvd

44
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,519
at cammed 23 which is the basis of our

45
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,798
conversation today I'll put a link to

46
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,359
his video presentation in the show

47
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,939
description

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,819
our conversation covers why zamir

49
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,900
considers hlvd to be the covid of

50
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:18,899
cannabis

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,819
how hlvd spreads

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,860
the effect hlvd has on cannabis plants

53
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:28,560
including some really amazing electron

54
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,840
microscope images that he captured of

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,239
affected trichomes

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,840
practical recommendations for testing

57
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:40,140
plants for hlvd and possible solutions

58
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,180
to the hlvd problem

59
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:44,339
before we get to my conversation with

60
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,719
zamir I want to thank this episode's

61
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,878
sponsor Fino Express

62
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:53,939
offers low-cost genetic testing services

63
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:57,359
to cultivation facilities

64
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:00,239
using qpcr technology Fino Express helps

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,879
cultivators identify genetic traits such

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
as plant sex while plants are still in

67
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,840
the seedling tray

68
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,479
they can also identify plant pathogens

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,939
such as hop late and viroid lettuce

70
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,699
chlorosis virus and powdery mildew

71
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,900
before the plants show obvious signs of

72
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,780
infection

73
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,599
contact Fino Express today so they can

74
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,658
help you predict prevent and eliminate

[Music]

84
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,699
good afternoon zamir thank you so much

85
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,060
for joining us on the podcast again

86
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,318
thanks man good to see you

87
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,539
I'm excited to talk with you today about

88
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,399
a topic that everyone seems to be

89
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,400
talking about and that's hop late and

90
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,580
viroid if you're watching or listening

91
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,560
and you're not familiar with hlvd well

92
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,600
you're in the right place because zamir

93
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,120
has done extensive research into the

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,580
viroid much of which he shared at

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,319
camid23 in his presentation I'll put the

96
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,819
link to that video in the show

97
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:30,060
description so you can check that out

98
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:33,599
but today not only are we going to cover

99
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,600
what hlvd is but also talk about ways to

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,520
potentially prevent and or eliminate it

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,740
so let's get into it now zamir at

102
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:46,918
kemet23 you called hop late and viroid

103
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,900
the covid of cannabis which does have a

104
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,779
nice ring to it and I think it's a good

105
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:53,399
way to describe what is going on in the

106
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,039
Cannabis industry for those who might

107
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,739
not be familiar so please explain why

108
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,819
you believe hlvd to be the covid of

109
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,500
cannabis

110
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,819
well I thought that throw that in

111
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,379
because there's a lot of similarities

112
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,120
you know between

113
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:07,680
um what we've experienced with covet

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,439
over the last three years and what's

115
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,819
happening with the Cannabis industry

116
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,759
first of all these are both organisms

117
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,159
that uh one's a one's a fire which is

118
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,259
the covid and the other one's a viroid

119
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,639
but they behave very similarly all the

120
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,919
literature shows that viruses and

121
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,079
thyroids behave in a very similar manner

122
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,659
so that was one obvious thing that that

123
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,279
was um draw my attention to the fact

124
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,320
that there are there are many

125
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,359
similarities the other being it spreads

126
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,459
really easy by hand and we know with

127
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,740
covet you know wash your hands make sure

128
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,239
you don't touch surfaces and and when

129
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,100
you when you blow your nose make sure

130
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,379
you throw away the tissues and so on and

131
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,300
so forth so any material that comes into

132
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,240
contact with your hands that has hop

133
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,280
latent infected material like sap is

134
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,199
going to transmit it so that was another

135
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,599
analogy that I thought was was pretty

136
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,300
pretty interesting and also it spreads

137
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,340
really well both covet and and

138
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,978
um the hot blade now I should make a

139
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:04,379
distinction here

140
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:05,699
is not spread in the air I've seen some

141
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,740
reports where people say oh yeah it's

142
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,020
Airborne you got to watch your events it

143
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,759
doesn't spread in the air no it'll it'll

144
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,500
spread through seed obviously and if

145
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,500
there's pollen the pollen will fertilize

146
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,959
but in a general operation where you're

147
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,399
growing plants mothers flowers

148
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,459
um you don't have to worry about the

149
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:26,339
Airborne aspect of of public

150
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:28,379
now unlike um covet of course where we

151
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,839
develop vaccines we don't have vaccines

152
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:33,478
for for public we've got to develop some

153
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,859
other methods to to address it

154
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:36,359
um and the other one of the other main

155
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,580
differences which I think is important

156
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,500
in covet as you remember we're getting a

157
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,719
lot of mutations right new strains were

158
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,939
coming up all the time and they had to

159
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,160
develop new vaccines for that right now

160
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,139
with hop Layton we haven't seen a lot of

161
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,819
genetic diversity in other words it

162
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,519
looks like the the first report in

163
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:55,199
California that genetic strain that was

164
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,599
there is very similar to one in

165
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,400
Massachusetts is similar to the one in

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,979
Colorado we've actually founded in

167
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:04,379
Canada so it almost looks like right now

168
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:07,620
anyway it's genetically uh you know

169
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:09,478
fairly stable it's not diverged itself

170
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,038
as much

171
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,899
um what that should you do maybe with

172
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,180
with more selection pressure you know in

173
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,818
the human population there's so much

174
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,680
diversity people react differently and

175
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,080
so the virus is constantly trying to

176
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,840
keep up uh maybe in in the Cannabis

177
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,180
world it's perhaps not the same the

178
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,799
other thing with Covenant and hop latent

179
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,840
the symptoms right you know you've had

180
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,720
people that are asymptomless with covid

181
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,359
right they test positive but no fever no

182
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,520
no runny nose no sneezing and in

183
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,800
cannabis it's the same thing uh you have

184
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,139
these asymptomatic plants that unless

185
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,120
you do a PCR test which we'll get into

186
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,340
later you may or may not know that

187
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,959
you've got hop Layton because the plants

188
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:50,519
may not show any symptoms

189
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,799
so there's a there's a ton of

190
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,779
similarities uh between the two types of

191
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,579
diseases I just I just wish we had the

192
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,098
kind of money that was thrown at covid

193
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,079
throwing thrown at us in cannabis

194
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,579
because I tell you if we did that we'd

195
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,560
be done in a year like we'd have all the

196
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,598
problems solved because you need money

197
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,060
for research and uh that's that's

198
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,800
getting pretty tight

199
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,939
yeah for sure and there were a few

200
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,978
things that you mentioned in there that

201
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,259
that I jotted down that you know might

202
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,879
might be kind of news to me because I

203
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,120
know that there has been some discussion

204
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:24,060
and debate about whether hlvd actually

205
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,220
spreads through seed so it seemed like

206
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,598
you were just saying that yes it does so

207
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,759
um yeah there's some pretty good

208
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,918
evidence that Tommy genomics

209
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,860
um released and shared with us as well

210
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,899
as work that they did with Texas A M

211
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,719
um and they you know they they did two

212
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,580
things they took infected mothers

213
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,159
um and added pollen from that was clean

214
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,778
from a clean plant and they found that a

215
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,778
high proportion of seeds that came out

216
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:50,399
of that were were had hop latent and

217
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,679
we'll talk about on the outside versus

218
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,720
the inside right and then and then they

219
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,000
took a healthy mother and then they took

220
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,800
pollen from an infected male and put

221
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,100
that onto the plant and again they got

222
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,899
seeds that that had hop late and the

223
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,540
infected females

224
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,419
um that receive healthy male pollen had

225
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,799
a higher seed infection frequency so the

226
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,439
mother is being infected is more

227
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,199
important than than the father being

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,899
affected or the pollen and a lot of the

229
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,180
contamination or harplane was on the

230
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,179
outside on the seed coat which is very

231
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:28,559
common with with many viruses but they

232
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:30,838
they did show uh maybe 10 15 infection

233
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,399
inside the seed where they did

234
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,660
experiments where they totally cleaned

235
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,519
the outside of the sea to the point

236
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,500
where the seed was pretty much killed

237
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,080
and then they rescued their tissues from

238
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,220
inside and ran a PCR on it and it was

239
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,040
positive

240
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,080
so it's both outside and inside and

241
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,719
infected mothers play a more important

242
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,180
role than interactive pollen

243
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,278
so now if you did have a seed that had

244
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,439
the viroid on the outside and maybe not

245
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,299
in the inside but you didn't clean it

246
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,420
disinfect it or whatever and where to

247
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,979
plant that seed could it infect the the

248
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,919
plant that emerges

249
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,539
it could in in cases where the seed coat

250
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,979
you know is still attached to the to the

251
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,599
cartolina coming out so you've got the

252
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,240
plant that's growing and and there's

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,980
some abrasion uh against the condolene

254
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,039
you could get transmission there through

255
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,139
mechanical mechanical damage

256
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,699
um and and really the only way to know

257
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,259
for sure obviously would be to test that

258
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,778
seedling so you know you've got five

259
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,519
seeds really you know high priced seeds

260
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:28,500
and you've grown them up and you've got

261
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,720
these five seedlings I'd test every one

262
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,580
of them just to be sure because that's a

263
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,580
great point where hot plating can start

264
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,019
and you want to eliminate that option so

265
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,060
um testing seedlings we'll talk about

266
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,100
what the right stage of testing would be

267
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:43,199
but I would say the best way is really

268
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,759
just to test to make sure

269
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,200
excellent

270
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,000
um and just to kind of complete I guess

271
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,379
setting the stage for you know people

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,879
who might not be familiar with populate

273
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,679
and thyroid we talked about you know how

274
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,778
it's how it's spreading and its

275
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,639
similarities to covid but what is it

276
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,500
actually doing to the plant how you know

277
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,419
what are the symptoms sort of why is

278
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,659
this such an issue with cultivators

279
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,639
right right so you know when the first

280
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:08,458
discovery of the Dayton was made it was

281
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,578
made in hops and this was back in about

282
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,199
88 and so they they the researchers

283
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:15,179
figured out what the sequence of the

284
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,100
thyroid was and they didn't see any

285
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,599
symptoms on the plant and when they

286
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,459
tried to transmit it to other plants

287
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,019
they didn't see anything happen so they

288
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,899
gave it the name hopefully so the word

289
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,120
latent basically means no symptoms and

290
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,399
and again with covid you could be

291
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,320
infected but be latent right you you're

292
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,139
harboring the viral the virus it's in

293
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,459
you but the PCR tests are showing it's

294
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,679
there but you're not you're not

295
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,179
expressing symptoms

296
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,639
um so that's where the Lincoln comes in

297
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:44,338
but then later at some point and usually

298
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,899
it's when the plants go into flower

299
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,760
um that we see the most dramatic

300
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,259
symptoms that's where I first recognized

301
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,659
it when I looked at a flowering plant

302
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:53,399
and it was much shorter

303
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,919
um the flowers weren't developed as well

304
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,440
the sort of the dudding symptom the the

305
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,838
flowers were smaller and these are the

306
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,000
same symptoms that the California

307
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,160
researchers two different Labs reported

308
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,899
that's how they first saw how they

309
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,219
Environ was on these flowering plants

310
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,620
and then

311
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,300
you measure THC and CBD and terpenes and

312
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,539
so on what you find out is that they're

313
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:17,278
dropped they've dropped depending on the

314
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:19,620
genetics of the plant and when the plant

315
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,120
got infected anywhere from 10 to 40

316
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,799
percent lower

317
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,179
and that's when the alarm Bells start

318
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,639
going off right you've got this

319
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,319
infection that came literally out of

320
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,659
nowhere because they hadn't seen it

321
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,180
before but it showed up on the flowering

322
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:36,360
plants now when you work backwards you

323
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:38,639
can see symptoms in mothers uh you can

324
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,700
get mother plants that are somewhat

325
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,259
stunted you can see symptoms in the veg

326
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,420
particularly depending on the

327
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,338
susceptibility of the genotype you're

328
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,838
working with I've seen stunted classic

329
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,500
bench that are obviously hopefully

330
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,760
infected the leaves are slightly curled

331
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,399
but I wouldn't rely on symptomology

332
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,338
alone I would definitely do the testing

333
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,539
to make sure but the the alarm Bells go

334
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,579
off when you're walking through a

335
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:04,860
flowering room and you're looking at the

336
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:06,179
plants and you recognize that genotype

337
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,860
but yet you're looking at it and saying

338
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,479
these flowers haven't developed they're

339
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,060
smaller they're they look like they're

340
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,459
they're like two weeks behind that's

341
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,799
when when you may understand that you've

342
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,439
got um public

343
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,759
excellent so now you mentioned Hops and

344
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,260
obviously it's in the name there so it

345
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,000
makes sense that it started there but

346
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,039
did I hear that right where

347
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,200
hoplet and viroid never really had a

348
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,278
negative effect on on hops like any

349
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,079
variety

350
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,600
yeah so when they first started they

351
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,819
didn't see see an effect but then like

352
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,860
as research shows as you the more you

353
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,480
look into it the more you find other

354
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,579
labs started looking at it particularly

355
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,639
in Europe in Germany and other countries

356
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:46,078
and they started to see in the UK they

357
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,659
started to see

358
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,939
um the the cones you know the flowers uh

359
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:54,240
the end result of the flowers and hops

360
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,600
are called cones the cones had lower

361
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,600
um acids and and uh and phenolics and

362
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,300
other chemicals that essential oils and

363
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,339
terpenes that are used to help you know

364
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,500
enhance the flavor of beer and so on

365
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:10,079
they were starting to see lower lower

366
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,000
quantities of that the plant itself was

367
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,338
not affected if you've ever seen a hot

368
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,139
plant that thing it grows in front of

369
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,779
your eyes I mean it it's putting on 12

370
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:21,299
14 inches of growth a day so it's

371
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:23,278
unlikely hoping does much on that but it

372
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,958
did seem to affect the flowers and that

373
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,879
when I read that report I thought okay

374
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,138
if this is happening in hops it's got to

375
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,240
happen in cannabis because they both

376
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:33,240
have similar flower flooring structures

377
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,220
and so on and so now they're finding it

378
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,560
but it's it's very genotype dependent

379
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,620
depending on the cultivar some of them

380
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:42,838
seem to be fine they resist the virus or

381
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,360
the viroid and others really come down

382
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,399
uh hard and again I draw the analogy to

383
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,919
covert some people get it and they're

384
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,740
walking away fine and others have to be

385
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,599
sent to the ER and a part of it is what

386
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,060
your genetic constitutional background

387
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,879
is that that makes the difference

388
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,619
yeah and and so it has that been the way

389
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,879
that the Hop industry has sort of dealt

390
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,820
with the issue they've sort of just

391
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,740
moved towards using uh cultivars that

392
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,540
are more tolerant of it

393
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,100
they've done that and they're aware that

394
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,679
it's spread by by mechanical

395
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,600
transmission so in hops where they use

396
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,638
machines to maybe prune the plants or

397
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,278
they take cuttings they're very careful

398
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,680
to to know that you know it's spread it

399
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:24,539
spread that way uh through the sap which

400
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,578
is useful information because the exact

401
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:28,259
same thing happens in cannabis when you

402
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:30,239
take cuttings and you you make

403
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:32,698
vegetative plants out of the out of the

404
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,159
original plant or you're using shears or

405
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:37,740
tools that that weren't necessarily

406
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,719
clean properly that will spread uh hop

407
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,959
later and that's what they found in in

408
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,278
uh in hops as well they didn't see very

409
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,338
high transmission

410
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:49,620
um in seed it was there maybe five to

411
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,139
eight percent not as high as what we're

412
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,000
seeing in cannabis but it may be that

413
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,820
the female plant the mother plant wasn't

414
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,259
as heavily infected and so there was you

415
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,899
know a little bit of infection but it

416
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,819
wasn't enough to create a very high sea

417
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,559
transmission rate as we see in in

418
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,260
cannabis

419
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,518
yeah and you mentioned too that when you

420
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:11,939
were explaining some of the differences

421
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,740
between hlvd and covid that the number

422
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,920
of different variants didn't seem to be

423
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,919
apparent in hlvd now when it when the

424
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:22,078
viroid jumped from Canada from hops to

425
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,360
cannabis was there a change there or is

426
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,219
it effectively the same viroid yeah it's

427
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,839
a good question the sequences that we

428
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,459
have and it's the ones that Kevin

429
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,820
mckernan has looked at at medicinal

430
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:34,018
genomics they're identical to the 1988

431
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,320
report

432
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,060
um on on Hops and so there doesn't seem

433
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,339
to have been a significant amount of

434
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,739
change at least in the genetic structure

435
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:46,860
now some of the papers I read on other

436
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,899
viroids there's about 32 other viroids

437
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,360
in other plants like potato spindle

438
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,519
tuber viroid they see a lot of genetic

439
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,519
diversity and part of it is when when

440
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,620
the viral is moving from host to host so

441
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,539
potato spinal tube or viral has a big

442
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,839
Host range you know tobacco tomato

443
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,519
petunia lots of plants and and they were

444
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,620
able to show as it moves into these

445
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,379
other hosts I guess it it needs to adapt

446
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:13,019
itself uh to this new environment and

447
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,059
and creates a new a new strain or a new

448
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,859
variant and and that could be what's

449
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:21,058
happening in humans right when it jumps

450
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:23,039
from China to India to to America it's

451
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:24,599
mutating as it goes through you know we

452
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,359
all have different genetic backgrounds

453
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:30,719
genetic composition and we're somehow

454
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:33,178
selecting more variants uh in in uh in

455
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,240
Coven so far knock on wood we haven't

456
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,860
seen that with with public

457
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,500
yeah because could that be more of a

458
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:42,119
problem if it were to start doing that

459
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,798
it would because all of a sudden you've

460
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,899
got you think you've got this genetic

461
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:47,940
strain that's resistant and now you've

462
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,980
got a new variant right it's more

463
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,080
aggressive more aggressive again very

464
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,000
similar to to what we see in Kobe and

465
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,859
that's where these vaccine companies are

466
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,538
making a fortune because I mean this

467
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:59,279
year again you know I already got my

468
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,679
little reminder that I've got to go for

469
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,839
my whatever it is fourth or fifth uh

470
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,660
vaccine booster they're going to develop

471
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,399
another one A different uh booster for

472
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,320
covet because they say that strain has

473
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,059
changed since last year so they're

474
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,740
continuously trying to keep up with with

475
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,119
this evolution

476
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,460
so

477
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,558
you mentioned too so hlvd it seems to be

478
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,759
a relatively new phenomenon uh that

479
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:23,220
we're seeing here

480
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,079
um but I wonder because you've studied a

481
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,660
lot of different pathogens in cannabis

482
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,460
has it been around longer than maybe we

483
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,919
know of and we just were not aware of it

484
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,840
like were you looking at plants

485
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,759
um and kind of expecting to find one

486
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,099
pathogen and not finding it and being

487
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,619
like hmm this doesn't make sense and now

488
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:43,319
that you know about hlvd now it kind of

489
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,399
the picture is clear yeah I mean it's

490
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,379
one of those things the more you look

491
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,960
the more you find right but prior to

492
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,900
2018 which is when I started my work

493
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,279
there were no reports of Hopland and and

494
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,960
part of it was because it hadn't been

495
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,819
discovered it hadn't been tested and

496
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,840
hence the two reports out of California

497
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:03,659
in 2019 they published in 2019 but the

498
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,099
plants were sampled back in 2018. I

499
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,080
think it's been around

500
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:09,779
um I can't say how long I would guess

501
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,359
maybe five to eight years somehow it

502
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,819
migrated over from hops clearly somebody

503
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,558
was working with hubs and maybe had sap

504
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,960
on their fingers or something happened

505
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,418
where it was then moved over into a

506
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,160
cannabis production facility but it's

507
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,380
probably been around I don't know eight

508
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,000
five to eight years and because it

509
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,980
hasn't been recognized we weren't really

510
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
looking for it if I saw a stunted plant

511
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,298
I would be like oh that's probably

512
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,759
cesarean or more or pythm uh not even

513
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:38,639
knowing what hopley is when they first

514
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,619
mentioned it to me uh 2018 I go ah don't

515
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,660
worry about it it only affects hops it's

516
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:44,699
latent and that's a mistake that

517
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,160
everybody makes initially and then we

518
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,679
realized my goodness this this organism

519
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,720
is very well adapted to infect cannabis

520
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,720
and cause damage

521
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:58,259
right and now part of your presentation

522
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,660
at kmed too you shared some really kind

523
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:03,419
of stunning images uh that you captured

524
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,038
with an electron microscope and and you

525
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,259
know with regular photography too but I

526
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,819
think the the ones in in particular

527
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:11,819
where you're looking at the trichomes

528
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:13,619
are are cool to to look at and if I'm

529
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:15,000
going to try to share my screen now we

530
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:18,359
could kind of take a look at those and

531
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,779
show the folks a few bear with me for

532
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,779
one second

533
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,298
so I guess while we're waiting I can

534
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,519
explain the scanning electron microscope

535
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:28,558
is is a very very powerful

536
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,660
a piece of equipment that magnifies

537
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,240
things tremendously in the in the

538
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:36,960
magnitude of thousands and so when you

539
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,400
look at trichomes as we see here now

540
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,079
um you can see these at this

541
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,620
magnification you could probably see

542
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:46,199
this with with a high uh magnified hand

543
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,178
lens or even under dissecting microscope

544
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,038
so uh even though this is under a

545
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,200
scanning this kind of thing I think you

546
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,538
can see uh with with a normal

547
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,120
microscopes on on the on the left side

548
00:20:54,538 --> 00:21:00,179
there you've got the normal stalks and

549
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:02,339
the the large you know glands or bulbs

550
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,200
at the top of the of the stalks and over

551
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:05,939
on the right

552
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,679
um You can see that they're smaller

553
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,480
they're they're there but they're

554
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,580
smaller they look they look like they're

555
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,980
not as well developed now the numbers

556
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,839
are the same that this is what surprised

557
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,579
me as well when you look at numbers you

558
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,099
have to sit and count these little dots

559
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:22,199
they're equal numbers on both sides so

560
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:23,579
when people say oh well the track of

561
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,798
numbers are down they're not actually

562
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:27,899
down they haven't developed as well

563
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,759
they're they're underdeveloped because

564
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,679
of this infection

565
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,960
yeah and of course the trichomes and

566
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,840
themselves like that's where the plant

567
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,400
produces the cannabinoids and terpenes

568
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:41,399
and everything correct yeah I mean this

569
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,500
is this is why the industry uh is doing

570
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,860
what it's doing is to collect all of the

571
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,200
the cannabinoids and and THC and other

572
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,240
things that are called resin from these

573
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,640
from these glands and so anything that

574
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,120
disrupts the development of these glands

575
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,100
or makes them smaller or or

576
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:01,859
poor quality then that's going to affect

577
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:05,519
the ultimate amount of THC and and CBD

578
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:07,500
and so on that you have so when one

579
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,960
looks at that it's basically the plant

580
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,298
is under some kind of stress right it's

581
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,700
supporting the reproduction of this

582
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:16,679
viroid which by the way it's producing

583
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,019
millions and millions of copies of

584
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,059
itself in the cell in the in the plant

585
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,779
cell it has no other way of replicating

586
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:27,538
again similar to Kobe has mechanisms to

587
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,220
replicate in humans but it still takes a

588
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:32,038
toll right people that suffer from an

589
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,900
infection are in bed for six or eight

590
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:36,720
days they're weak they they've lost

591
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,700
appetite and so on in the plant this

592
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,419
thing is taking energy out of the plant

593
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,880
by by making millions of copies and so

594
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:47,460
uh partly I think it's it's the stress

595
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,320
level on the plant and partly it may

596
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,579
also be that the the viral is actually

597
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,158
shutting down

598
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:54,558
parts of that pathway that produce these

599
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,000
cannabinoids we don't know for sure

600
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,918
there's a lot of research Labs doing

601
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,380
this kind of study right now to find out

602
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,900
what exactly is being turned off in

603
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,000
these infected plants and I bet you a

604
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,100
lot of the um the genes that are

605
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,859
involved in canaminoid synthesis are

606
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:13,199
also turned off or or down regulated

607
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:16,139
which would also explain why we're

608
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,840
seeing this reduced this reduced uh

609
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,960
cannabis now it's not just cannabinoids

610
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:25,259
we see plants turning yellow which means

611
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,480
they're lower in in chlorophyll we see

612
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,640
plants that are stunted which means

613
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,679
there's less growth in the in the apical

614
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,720
meristem so there's other things that

615
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,240
happen in in these plants so there's a

616
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,419
really good example of a particular uh

617
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,798
strain or genotype that is very distinct

618
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,419
I look at that and go boy that's how

619
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,779
blatant sure enough every one of those

620
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:48,179
is infected and you you can sort of see

621
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:50,220
fewer trichomes on those surrounding

622
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:53,280
leaves or bracks and then you've got

623
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,200
less which is again another effect of

624
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,980
this thyroid

625
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,259
right no and I did want to get to to

626
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,700
these because I think this is some of

627
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:06,000
the most striking images I mean that

628
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,759
looks like a deflated balloon yeah yeah

629
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,558
and this is I really was happy to get

630
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,538
this or at least the student the gradu

631
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,399
student and I that worked on this we're

632
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:15,599
really happy to see this there's nothing

633
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,798
more

634
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,079
um visual

635
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,400
you know they say a picture paints a

636
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,918
thousand words there's nothing more

637
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,159
visual than showing a grower or a

638
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,440
producer or or a regulator this is what

639
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,659
hop Layton does on your left is the

640
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,140
healthy plumped up full of cannabinoids

641
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:37,020
on the right it's deflated it either uh

642
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,179
it most likely inflated first so the way

643
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,879
the way these trichomes develop is that

644
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:45,360
the the outside the gland itself the

645
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,940
head is inflated first so it's ready to

646
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,759
go and then it's it's the cannabinoids

647
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,100
start to fill it up but if you've got a

648
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:56,700
situation where the cannabinoids are not

649
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:58,740
filling it up you know it's it's 40 less

650
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,659
then this this thing will start to

651
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,640
collapse right there's no there's no

652
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:05,100
Oxygen or no there's no support within

653
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,780
those within those so-called hot air

654
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:08,939
balloons I use the term hotter balloon

655
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:11,639
to describe this so these are dried

656
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,200
these are dried flowers now and so on

657
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,020
the left you can see the drawing does

658
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,058
not impact the structure of the of the

659
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:20,879
trichome gland or the head it's intact

660
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:22,740
because the cuticle is really strong but

661
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,440
on on the right when you've got hop Lane

662
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,720
infected because it hasn't inflated

663
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,860
completely it's getting to be like a

664
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,659
flat tire

665
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,798
you know there's no air in there to

666
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,320
begin with but then when you start

667
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:37,918
drawing these these um trichomes down

668
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:40,439
you see this shriveling effect

669
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,240
um it's quite dramatic yeah so that's

670
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,460
really cool because when I first saw

671
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,798
this I thought that well I mean this is

672
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,240
indicative that if you have a shriveled

673
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,119
up trichome it's not going to be

674
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,500
producing as many cannabinoids but what

675
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,439
you're saying is that this is just

676
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,019
showing that it hasn't been filled with

677
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,179
those actual cannabinoids so it's that's

678
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,798
that's interesting wow yeah because the

679
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,380
plant's going to go ahead and create

680
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,538
this this cavity you know in order to in

681
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,059
order to prepare itself to to produce

682
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:11,099
the cannabinoids and usually the

683
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:12,778
cannabinoid production starts when the

684
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,939
stock which is you know the bottom

685
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:16,740
starts to elongate and that's been shown

686
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,960
by by previous studies so when the stock

687
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,640
elongates that's when this cavity starts

688
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,558
to fill up but now you're going to hop

689
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,480
late an infected plant it's not

690
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,519
producing as much cannabinoids and so it

691
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,319
doesn't fill up and then when you dry it

692
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,298
you get this effect sort of you're

693
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:34,259
looking at a plump you know plump grape

694
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:36,839
on the left and the raisin on the right

695
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,940
wow yeah no and these are fantastic

696
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,859
images for the very fact that we were

697
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,480
talking about like it's it's latent it's

698
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:44,399
not always obvious if you were looking

699
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,259
at a plant

700
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,940
um that it's that it's got any issues

701
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:49,919
with it maybe not until you take it to

702
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:53,700
the lab and get it tested but if you

703
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,220
zoom in like you have well here it is

704
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,778
yeah

705
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,600
so

706
00:26:57,778 --> 00:27:03,058
I think now we can kind of transition

707
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:05,219
into talking about well we've

708
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:07,619
established the problem what do we do

709
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,019
about it so if you were a grower and you

710
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:12,599
you suspect that you have an infected

711
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:14,099
plant what are your options

712
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,538
right so there's there's many things

713
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,339
Growers can do I mean the first thing

714
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,798
they need to do for sure is confirm that

715
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:21,599
they've got hot latent so whatever plant

716
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,158
they're dealing with most likely it's a

717
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,019
flowering plant because that's usually

718
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,880
when you see it and they send it off for

719
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:29,099
testing the first thing would be to work

720
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,020
backwards and try to figure out where

721
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,119
did where did I get my my clones from

722
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:35,158
from for that particular plant or that

723
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,899
particular genotype what did I did I

724
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,000
grow it indoors did I purchase it from

725
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,679
someone else or did I start it from seed

726
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,179
uh and once you've sort of work

727
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,340
backwards you can say to yourself all

728
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,860
right let's assume it came from clones

729
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:49,259
within your own facility that means the

730
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:52,019
mother plant definitely has hot labeled

731
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,759
so you work backwards you then test your

732
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:55,259
mother plants uh depending on how big

733
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,480
they are and so on we can we can talk

734
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:59,579
about sampling strategies but you test

735
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,679
your mother plant and obviously if the

736
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:03,778
mother plant is infected

737
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,220
um the bad news is that I would say it's

738
00:28:03,778 --> 00:28:07,380
got to be it's got to be thrown away

739
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,298
you've got to get rid of it

740
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,778
um there's really no proven ways right

741
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:14,579
now to to rescue a plant that has hot

742
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:16,740
latent in it I mean we've talked about

743
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:19,798
Mary stem culture and tissue culture and

744
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,980
so on it's possible but it hasn't been

745
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:25,079
demonstrated on a high level or a high

746
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,360
scale that you can you can rescue a

747
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,220
mother plant that's called public

748
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,658
so if you've proven that it's your

749
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,798
mother plan then always you get rid of

750
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,778
that

751
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,119
um the other possibility is that it

752
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,759
picked it up when the plant was in veg

753
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:40,259
so let's say you're vegging on a table

754
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,940
and if you're using Hydroponics then

755
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:45,119
you've got water or nutrient solution

756
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,038
moving between plants uh We've shown and

757
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,798
others have shown that it can't move

758
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,079
with water with recirculating water and

759
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:54,418
so a veg plant that's that's maybe two

760
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,038
weeks old could potentially have picked

761
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:58,919
up hot latent through the root system

762
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:00,900
and and the viral that makes its way

763
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,179
into the plant that way and then of

764
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,100
course the last alternative is a seed if

765
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,620
you started from seed you didn't test

766
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:09,599
the plant that came off the seed it

767
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:13,379
could be that that that gave rise to

768
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:16,019
your um infected flowering plant

769
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,600
so it's it's a it's a detective sort of

770
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:20,759
a detective process or you know a

771
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,558
process of elimination deciding where

772
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,140
where did it come from you need to know

773
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,000
that that's number one

774
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,259
yeah and I think you kind of answered my

775
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,179
next question but I think it's a good

776
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:32,220
good thing to hammer home there really

777
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:36,240
doesn't seem to be any sort of treatment

778
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,860
or kind of remediation options available

779
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,480
yet right

780
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,979
yeah if you've got a heavy heavy

781
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,360
infected or even an infected mother

782
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,980
plant

783
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,079
um now you know people have tried and

784
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,819
people are trying taking cuttings from

785
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,079
different parts of the of the Big Planet

786
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,639
so you could you could definitely do

787
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,139
that you could take them from the top

788
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,120
they're actively growing you could take

789
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,500
it from the side the bottom but then you

790
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:58,500
have to go through and test all of those

791
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,480
to see if by chance and really it is a

792
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,058
chance if by a chance you are able to

793
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,278
get a clone that was free of of Health

794
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:08,158
label you know when the viral gets in

795
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,960
and we can discuss this now the first

796
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,419
place that goes is down into the roots

797
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,278
right so let's say let's say um I

798
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,799
infected it through a cutting I went

799
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:20,099
with my tools and I transferred some sap

800
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,658
onto a cut surface and the first place

801
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,278
that goes is down into the roots and

802
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,980
that takes about two weeks

803
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,480
so let's say two weeks after uh it was

804
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,640
introduced it goes down into the roots

805
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,679
and then from The Roots it's moved

806
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,320
upward and the reason it's moved upward

807
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,720
is it it sort of follows the flow of of

808
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,939
Sugar Star sugars that are being

809
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,460
produced by photosynthesis in the plant

810
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,140
and that usually is towards the actively

811
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,940
growing shoots which are the young

812
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,278
shoots so you'll find it in the young

813
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,919
shoots probably around four weeks after

814
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,480
that initial infection occurred and then

815
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,000
it starts moving around the plant so

816
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,278
let's say by by six weeks it's now

817
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,960
pretty much everywhere but there are

818
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:00,599
cases where you know a branch gets

819
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,759
missed you've got a disease plan and all

820
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,980
of a sudden you know a healthy branch on

821
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,480
one side I think I have a photo uh in

822
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,339
the presentation we can come back to it

823
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,319
in a second for some reason that Branch

824
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,538
got missed if you're lucky enough you

825
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,278
can get a cutting out of that a clone

826
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:17,278
out of that and you may have escaped

827
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:19,140
happily at instant in that particular in

828
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,058
that particular plant

829
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,820
um so it's not a uniform distribution

830
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:26,099
throughout and so some producers will go

831
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:28,379
through and take clones from various

832
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:30,359
parts of the of the mother plant in the

833
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,240
hopes that they can find a few that

834
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:34,558
don't have the uh the viraline and that

835
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,440
is effective

836
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,058
I don't know I don't know I mean it

837
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,159
obviously they all have to be tested

838
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:43,019
right they all have to be tested because

839
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,600
you don't know for sure whether you're

840
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:47,158
lucked out or whether it's dormant like

841
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,099
it's it's there but it hasn't had a

842
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,919
chance to to to grow out and and

843
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:55,859
replicate now very stem culture which is

844
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,659
taking the very very very small tip uh

845
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:59,939
does seem to work in many other plants

846
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:01,980
so in potato particularly here in Canada

847
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,159
when we had an outbreak of potato

848
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,599
spindle tuba viroid back in the 80s uh

849
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,580
the government stepped in and said

850
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:12,178
nobody's going to be able to grow any

851
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:14,879
potatoes unless they all came from a

852
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,440
tissue concert meristem plant and so

853
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,679
they started this marriage time program

854
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,259
throughout Canada and uh only Growers

855
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,759
that purchased these plants that were

856
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:26,158
propagated through tissue culture could

857
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,019
grow potatoes and as a result it got

858
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,600
wiped out like you can hardly find that

859
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:33,298
in most commercial Fields because of

860
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:35,759
this rigorous insistence on using clean

861
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:37,980
plants now with cannabis it's hard to do

862
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,019
because a we have to show that those

863
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,360
plants are clean from Marriage to some

864
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:44,158
culture and B not everybody is going to

865
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,839
want to buy from One Source right

866
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,659
everybody's got their own preferential

867
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,879
source for plants and so there's no

868
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:54,600
guarantee that the plants you buy will

869
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,580
be free of up late unless they're tested

870
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,139
all right so yeah that's that's a good

871
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:59,158
segue so let's talk about testing

872
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,500
because one of the things that you

873
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,140
mentioned in in your presentation is

874
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,940
that sort of the only real way to get

875
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,340
rid of an infection if you have it in

876
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:12,240
your facility is sort of this systematic

877
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:14,639
testing and removing of infected plants

878
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,380
so I'm wondering like sort of what is

879
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,299
the protocol for that

880
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,700
um you know which plant should be tested

881
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:23,339
and um you know is it all of them just

882
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,840
the ones that sort of appear sick just

883
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:26,639
the ones that are kind of in the same

884
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,918
vicinity as some confirmed positives

885
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,200
what are sort of the best best practices

886
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,059
in developing that testing protocol

887
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,220
yeah so definitely

888
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:36,960
um systematic a systematic approach has

889
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,440
to be taken and one that where the

890
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,579
Growers is taking a lot of Records

891
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,278
um so they can follow through what

892
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:46,319
exactly happened from from A to B to C

893
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:48,538
the first place definitely starting with

894
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,058
the mother plants uh and testing those

895
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:52,919
to see if they're clean and uh whether

896
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:54,898
they may accidentally have picked up hot

897
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,880
Lake thyroid I would say the second

898
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:59,879
place to test would be your veg your veg

899
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,080
plants somehow if some viral got through

900
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,659
and

901
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,339
um wasn't detected in the mothers you

902
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:06,899
may see symptoms in that veg plant

903
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:08,819
sometimes they are a little bit shorter

904
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:11,219
may have slightly curl leaves so again

905
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,200
being very Vigilant about what the

906
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,878
plants are supposed to look like and and

907
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,039
most Growers have had years of

908
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,480
experience they may look at that plant

909
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,519
because you know that that's not grown

910
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,898
right did I did I not fertilize the

911
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:24,358
property is it not getting enough light

912
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:26,219
it may actually be infected with with

913
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:27,779
pop latent

914
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,959
um I would not test necessarily

915
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,580
flowering plants only if you want to

916
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,019
make sure that your body or don't have

917
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:36,179
it because at that stage it's too late

918
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:37,739
it's not a whole lot you can gain from

919
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,960
testing a flowering plant you're going

920
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:43,500
to get rid of it anyway it's mostly the

921
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,260
mothers and the veg plants now clones

922
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,719
when you test clones they should be

923
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,399
rooted so if you get a bunch of unrooted

924
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,618
clones from someone and and you want to

925
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,679
get it tested for half latent I would

926
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:57,119
suggest rooting them first because if

927
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,800
they are infected the first place the

928
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,880
virus is going to go it's back down into

929
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,099
the roots

930
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,800
and we've shown uh when you've got a two

931
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,480
week old rooted cutting that if it came

932
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,180
from a mother plant you will find it in

933
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,740
the roots 100

934
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:12,838
you may not find it in the leaves the

935
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:14,939
leaves that may originally have had the

936
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,519
viroid and you may have tested it and

937
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,500
found a negative I would say rooted get

938
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,838
the roots coming out take little samples

939
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,119
off those set them off if they come back

940
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:28,199
negative it's negative if it comes back

941
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,519
positive throw it out wow okay so and a

942
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,500
lot of people do import a lot of clothes

943
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,619
and most of them tend to be not rooted

944
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,838
root them first and then test them and

945
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:39,180
then get rid of the ones that um they're

946
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,219
not positive the beauty about the root

947
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:43,919
sampling is it's it's a more sensitive

948
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:45,299
at that at that early stage because the

949
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,420
roots are starting to accumulate that

950
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:51,720
violet later on when that plant grows up

951
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,760
so let's say it's now six weeks old

952
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:55,139
you can find the viral everywhere in the

953
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,240
leaves right we talked about how it

954
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:59,460
takes two weeks to go down four weeks

955
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,439
and then six weeks so there's a recent

956
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,420
uh paper that came out that that

957
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,559
basically says you can test leaves it's

958
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,260
not a problem

959
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,000
only if that plant is old enough you

960
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,099
know it's six weeks eight weeks ten

961
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,440
weeks old and it's had a chance to

962
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:16,800
spread the viroid in the leaves if it's

963
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,659
an early plant a clone or a veg plant go

964
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,339
for the roots because that's where

965
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:22,440
you'll very likely find it because it

966
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:24,358
hasn't had a chance to move out into the

967
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,039
foliage as yet

968
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:27,598
right and then I guess further

969
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,880
complicating things because I know that

970
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,079
some experiments that we've done or our

971
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,900
team has done

972
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,480
we've seen plants where it it's

973
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,280
detectable in The Roots but never

974
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,420
actually makes it up into the upper

975
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,680
leaves

976
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,659
um which could be

977
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:44,879
um you know could be tolerance that

978
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,559
we're looking for but like you said if

979
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,079
it's in a hydroponic system and those

980
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,179
roots are in the water and that water

981
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,800
circulating well there you go now you

982
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:56,519
have your asymptomatic spreader right

983
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,180
yes yes and so you're bang on in terms

984
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,800
of

985
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:00,358
um it does because it does go down to

986
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,820
the roots we can use that as a

987
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:05,039
consistent method for testing however

988
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,019
it's not to say that it's necessarily

989
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,759
going to move into into the leaves now

990
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:11,219
everything we work with is highly

991
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,680
susceptible so I've never seen a

992
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:15,838
situation yet where um it's in the roots

993
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,338
but eventually it doesn't find its way

994
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,380
into the leaves so that you're right it

995
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:21,179
could be a tolerance or resistance which

996
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,579
makes sense the plant is fighting it

997
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:25,440
it's keeping it localized doesn't want

998
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:28,019
it to spread up into the leaves and

999
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,300
flowers but you know environment plays a

1000
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:32,820
pretty important role in terms of how it

1001
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,859
moves from The Roots into the lead so we

1002
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,539
find for example when you flip or when

1003
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:39,059
you when you turn the lights into 12

1004
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:41,159
hours of light and 12 hours of dark that

1005
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:43,259
plant that only has viroid in The Roots

1006
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:45,358
all of a sudden will start showing it

1007
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,640
really fast in the leaves and the

1008
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,639
flowers so again it may be that that

1009
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,559
flow of sugar that's being triggered by

1010
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,659
the by the uh the flipping of the lights

1011
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,639
that's causing this movement back into

1012
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:58,440
the into the upper leaves

1013
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,059
so I'll make some experiments now where

1014
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,059
I'm putting plants in the darkness I'm

1015
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:05,099
putting plants in full light I'm putting

1016
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:07,739
plants at different temperatures trying

1017
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:10,140
to see if I have a root infection what's

1018
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:12,000
it going to take to move that viroid up

1019
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:13,858
into the uh into the upper part of the

1020
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,480
plant because maybe we can play around

1021
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,119
with environment you know environmental

1022
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,400
conditions might might

1023
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,880
reduce the the rate of spread as well as

1024
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,880
genetics

1025
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,460
yeah because I would think particularly

1026
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,980
in the cases of a mother plant right

1027
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,260
where if you're taking cuttings from the

1028
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,539
canopy from the leaves even if it were

1029
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,579
to have an infection in the roots that

1030
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:38,940
never got to those leaves

1031
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:40,800
could produce clean clones yes

1032
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,358
theoretically yes but I do want to go

1033
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,980
back to sort of like that testing

1034
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:45,598
protocol you said where you know you

1035
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,338
said start with the moms and to test

1036
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,380
them so what are we looking at for

1037
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:51,358
sampling like I guess it's kind of a

1038
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,760
good point should you be testing the

1039
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,838
roots or the actual branches that you're

1040
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,480
going to be taking cuttings from

1041
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:59,940
everything

1042
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,039
so right up until this past year the

1043
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,220
entire industry was was sampling leaves

1044
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,599
yeah and it worked it worked there's

1045
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,279
nothing wrong with what they were doing

1046
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,380
all these years all the testing Labs

1047
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,000
that I know of were either taking leaves

1048
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,980
or patios patios seemed to be a little

1049
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,900
better patials are the the connections

1050
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,000
that the leaves have to the stem because

1051
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,858
again it's the vascular system right it

1052
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,179
allows the movement of the sugar in

1053
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,858
there and they were and they were

1054
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:24,838
finding copulating all the reports that

1055
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:26,460
we have pretty much are based on Leaf

1056
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:28,559
testing

1057
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,199
um so a big mother plant uh They're

1058
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,179
saying four samples

1059
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:35,819
either four samples through various

1060
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:37,919
parts of the plant either separate or

1061
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,838
you can combine them and that'll give

1062
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,920
you one composite sample and maybe save

1063
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:42,659
you a bit of money because you're not

1064
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,619
testing individual samples you're

1065
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:47,159
combining the tissues into one tube

1066
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,019
um

1067
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,598
the root system on one of these larger

1068
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:53,880
moms is harder to get to because really

1069
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,380
the ideal sampling location is is the

1070
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,960
root system more towards the central

1071
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,660
stem and so digging on in there and

1072
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,539
causing some potential damage uh may not

1073
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:06,118
be work worth the effort so on a larger

1074
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:07,079
mom and I'm going to say two months and

1075
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,119
older

1076
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,280
you're probably okay with with taking

1077
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,680
these four leaf samples or patio samples

1078
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,440
and combining them anything younger than

1079
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:18,539
that where it's still potentially in the

1080
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,358
roots and maybe hasn't spread uniformly

1081
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:23,219
I would go with the with the uh Roots so

1082
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,259
there would definitely be clones it

1083
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:27,000
would definitely be veg plants and

1084
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,180
potentially plants that you're trying to

1085
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,639
save for future months there are six

1086
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:35,039
maybe eight weeks old go for the roots

1087
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,299
on an established mother that you're is

1088
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,980
in your Nursery you've had for maybe

1089
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,900
three years I don't know how long the

1090
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,880
Growers keep these plants the leaves

1091
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,320
will probably do a good job if if your

1092
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,838
sampling is systematically done

1093
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,760
throughout the canopy

1094
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:49,858
and how frequently I mean should you be

1095
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,960
testing monthly or just when you're

1096
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:54,358
taking cuttings what's what's your

1097
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,920
advice there yeah that's that's a good a

1098
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:57,960
good question and I guess it's going to

1099
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,599
depend on on whether you've got the same

1100
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,338
arms that you're using over and over in

1101
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,320
which case I wouldn't really sample them

1102
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:06,358
more than once a month if it's an

1103
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,820
established mother if it's a younger

1104
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:10,500
vegetative plant that goes rapidly and

1105
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,780
you're just about ready to take it in

1106
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,780
the flour I will test it again after two

1107
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,920
weeks from the first test just to see

1108
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,180
whether you may have missed something

1109
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:24,780
and it's it's it's outgrown itself since

1110
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:27,059
so so it's going to vary from from two

1111
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,040
weeks to four weeks I know some some

1112
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:30,358
Growers like to sample every week just

1113
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,980
to be absolutely sure that they haven't

1114
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:34,078
missed

1115
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,059
um you know a potential positive because

1116
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,380
I guess you know if you missed it and

1117
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,900
that's going to go into the flower room

1118
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,780
you've lost a lot of potential Revenue

1119
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,180
by by not having tested that one plant

1120
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,940
is supposed to pay whatever it is fifty

1121
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:49,379
dollars for for an extra sample and so

1122
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,440
they may go they may do it every week

1123
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,480
but I think every two weeks on actively

1124
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,119
growing plants and every four weeks or

1125
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,000
once a month on plants that are that are

1126
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,099
larger and perhaps not not growing as as

1127
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,199
rapidly

1128
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:06,599
excellent

1129
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:08,759
um and that would be and sorry say again

1130
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,200
which ones would be Roots which ones

1131
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,060
would be leaves so definitely the

1132
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:14,098
younger plants so anything I would say

1133
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:16,619
younger than about six weeks

1134
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:18,180
do the leaves us excuse me do the roots

1135
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,619
right because they're still growing

1136
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:21,000
they're still developing root systems

1137
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,858
they're still trying to move the thyroid

1138
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,320
if they're plants that are older three

1139
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:27,179
months and older the leaves should be

1140
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,460
fine as long as there are multiple

1141
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:31,618
samples right at least four that are

1142
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,599
combined or sentenced separately

1143
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:36,180
um and similarly for the roots we find

1144
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,039
if you take three or four small root

1145
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,440
samples and and combine them into one

1146
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:43,139
that one result is good enough to tell

1147
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,420
you whether the plant's infected or not

1148
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:48,480
and now is this the same protocol

1149
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,760
applicable if you have an a node

1150
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,679
infection or not like if you if you know

1151
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,040
you've got infected plants do you up

1152
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:58,379
your testing or or what well technically

1153
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:01,318
that infected plant shouldn't be in your

1154
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:03,780
facility but if you've decided to keep

1155
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:05,400
it uh then definitely I would I would

1156
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,500
test it every couple of weeks well no

1157
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,019
not not necessarily if you keep it or

1158
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,179
kept it but you know I have a grow I

1159
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:13,679
have a grow now it's clean I'm testing

1160
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:15,899
everything's coming back negative

1161
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,940
everything is great okay but now I'm

1162
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,579
finding oh no a few plants over in this

1163
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,679
corner now they're infected should I do

1164
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:25,260
more testing to make sure to kind of

1165
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:27,059
mitigate this spread somehow or well if

1166
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,520
it's surely if it's a definite positive

1167
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:31,858
I would I would move it out I would move

1168
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,719
it into another room and then uh decide

1169
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:35,219
what you want to do don't leave it there

1170
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,480
now

1171
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:39,719
um it's interesting because I haven't

1172
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,358
seen any data yet to suggest that the

1173
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,459
viroid moves very effectively you know

1174
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:45,659
down down the road for example if if

1175
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,400
somebody's walking

1176
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:49,559
you know they say with your clothes

1177
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,660
brush up against the plant I don't know

1178
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,818
that that is sufficient damage to the

1179
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:56,639
leaf to to move properly it does for

1180
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:58,139
many viruses and thyroids but there may

1181
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,940
be data out there but I haven't seen it

1182
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:01,318
yet and the reason I say that is because

1183
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,240
I'm you know being I've walked into

1184
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:05,400
facilities where they've got a few

1185
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,078
infected plants here then everywhere if

1186
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,599
this thing was moving with with people

1187
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:11,940
brushing up against the plants every

1188
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,920
damn plant in that location would be

1189
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,200
infected and that's not the case we're

1190
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,539
finding isolated spots Here There and

1191
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:22,679
Everywhere that may have been introduced

1192
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:25,079
through a a pruning tool sap sap the

1193
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:26,639
movement of sap is super important so

1194
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,519
when you brush up against a plant there

1195
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:32,699
really is no sap coming being released

1196
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:35,940
or or on your clothes that's gonna react

1197
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:38,399
on a wound on another plant but sap on

1198
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,079
your tools and sap on your gloves so

1199
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,059
you've got obvious sap stuck to your

1200
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,039
gloves and you touch another plant and

1201
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:45,960
you damage it that will transmit it

1202
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,659
damage is the key

1203
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,358
the tissue has to be damaged usually I

1204
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:52,980
think that it has to be the vascular

1205
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,139
system has to be exposed in other words

1206
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,599
there has to be a broken vein or a

1207
00:44:55,139 --> 00:45:00,000
broken off leaf that allows that Viral

1208
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,220
to to enter in I think just putting the

1209
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,139
viroid on the surface of a leaf and

1210
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:06,480
letting it sit I don't believe is going

1211
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:07,799
to cause an infection so you got to have

1212
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,500
the wounding and you've got to have the

1213
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,240
sap and water so these plants could have

1214
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,300
picked it up if there was recirculating

1215
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:18,299
water that has the viroid in it and and

1216
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:20,579
somehow got into root contact and then

1217
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,920
of course the viral is spread within the

1218
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,140
uh within the plant so recirculating

1219
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,059
water is a problem because

1220
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,879
I haven't seen any treatments yet that

1221
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:33,539
work so even 100 degrees Centigrade

1222
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:36,300
heating doesn't do it uh UV doesn't do

1223
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:38,699
it fluorination doesn't do it I don't

1224
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,700
know yet what treatments could be made

1225
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:43,199
to water to clean it up recirculating

1226
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:44,699
water yet I mean there's there's

1227
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,098
obviously a lot of companies working on

1228
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:49,259
that and eventually we'll have an answer

1229
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:50,640
but right now you have to be super

1230
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,400
careful with water that's being

1231
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:56,879
recirculated from an infected infected

1232
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:00,599
mother or plant wow yeah that that seems

1233
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,818
that seems like a massive issue now

1234
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,039
in terms of that so in addition to

1235
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:07,139
testing plants you should you should be

1236
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,699
testing your water and your surfaces

1237
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:10,500
your equipment things like that as well

1238
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,539
yeah so

1239
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,219
um definitely if you're recirculating

1240
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:16,739
and you know you've got a high incidence

1241
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:18,659
of hot blatant you're almost guaranteed

1242
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:20,459
to to have it in the in the

1243
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:22,440
recirculating water now we got to

1244
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,139
remember it's not pure water that has

1245
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,179
the viroid it's little flakes of small

1246
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:29,338
pieces of roots and organic matter and

1247
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:31,559
debris that's come off the roots that's

1248
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:32,639
left off that's carrying the thyroid in

1249
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:34,318
it

1250
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,059
um and so when the water is recirculated

1251
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,599
they're still it's still got a little

1252
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:41,099
bit of particles and stuff in it that

1253
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:44,160
potentially has the has the thyroid in

1254
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:46,380
it we've seen it on surfaces on for

1255
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,179
example on flood tables so if there's a

1256
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,280
plant that's sitting on a table and and

1257
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:52,139
there's water you know up against the

1258
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,599
roots on the bottom you can find hot

1259
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:57,118
latent on the surface of that table as

1260
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,940
well as of course on tools for that

1261
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,940
cleaning bleach does a pretty good job

1262
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:05,220
or or work on two percent because that

1263
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,900
comes in direct contact with with the

1264
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:08,818
water or the you know the film of water

1265
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,338
that's on the table

1266
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:14,039
um it can eliminate pump late and viral

1267
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:17,519
quite effectively on on tools and on the

1268
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:20,099
on the surfaces of tables but in terms

1269
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,019
of what does it do to sap if there's

1270
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:24,539
infected sap

1271
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:26,699
um I don't know how effective vercon or

1272
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:28,800
bleach are at this stage where you've

1273
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,719
got visible sap being moved from plant

1274
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,960
to plant whether whether those two

1275
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:36,419
chemicals will completely eradicate uh

1276
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,579
the thyroid but for surfaces there's

1277
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,300
definitely materials out there that will

1278
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:42,300
work

1279
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,740
excellent that's good news now in terms

1280
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,140
of testing

1281
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:48,539
um I think you mentioned before PCR qpcr

1282
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:50,639
is the gold standard for testing is that

1283
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:52,500
the option that you recommend I would

1284
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,299
say so and most Labs realize that and

1285
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,599
they're geared their their methodologies

1286
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:00,300
to test using qpcr yeah there's really

1287
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,720
no other effective rapid tests that will

1288
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:06,119
will work for how blade

1289
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,059
excellent

1290
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,680
all right well we covered a lot Samir

1291
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:12,239
um I don't want to be definitely mindful

1292
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:16,199
of your time

1293
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:18,419
um so is there anything we missed

1294
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:20,639
don't give up hope

1295
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,680
just like just like everything else and

1296
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,059
just like covet you know and and there's

1297
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:25,739
people obviously they don't necessarily

1298
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:27,960
believe in Kobe but I think we've got a

1299
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,459
good handle in it now not to say that

1300
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,679
it's not going to be a problem later on

1301
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,659
but we've got a good handle we put a lot

1302
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,059
of good science into it they we threw a

1303
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:38,279
lot of money at it and and it's under

1304
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:40,199
control with hop Layton I think it's a

1305
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,839
similar thing we put some good science

1306
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:45,000
into it get some money going uh that can

1307
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:48,299
fund research and help companies develop

1308
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,059
products that that will work uh Growers

1309
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:53,220
uh in general are very astute when they

1310
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:55,380
know they've got a problem they'll find

1311
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:57,480
every means they can uh to address it

1312
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,818
and I think they're starting to do that

1313
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,460
they're starting to see for example that

1314
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:04,318
certain uh strains or certain genotypes

1315
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,760
are more resilient than others they're

1316
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,318
going to start using that in their

1317
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,180
crosses or they're going to start using

1318
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:11,219
that to to

1319
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:12,719
um to produce if they know it's in the

1320
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:13,858
seed they're going to be doing seed

1321
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,500
testing or they're not going to be

1322
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:18,960
buying seed from a location that hasn't

1323
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,159
necessarily certified it if they're

1324
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,300
buying clothes they're going to be a

1325
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,759
little bit more careful about the

1326
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,839
sources of their clothes if they've got

1327
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,940
an outbreak they're going to do

1328
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:28,799
everything they can uh including people

1329
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,500
wearing proper clothes and wearing

1330
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,660
gloves and sanitizing their tools and so

1331
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,338
on and when you use a combination of

1332
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:37,078
these things

1333
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:38,880
um it's it's not going to go away but

1334
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,800
but it's it's manageable

1335
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,720
the more you understand obviously the

1336
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,599
more you can manage but

1337
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:48,598
um I know numbers now are scary 90 of

1338
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,980
California production has it 50 in

1339
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:52,619
Canada

1340
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:55,079
um it's those are scary numbers but I

1341
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:57,599
think as we learn more about this thing

1342
00:49:55,079 --> 00:50:00,560
uh you know in a couple years maybe I

1343
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:03,240
won't have to do these uh webinars or

1344
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,440
podcasts anymore because it it's not

1345
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,479
going to be important I mean two years

1346
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,880
ago I think you mentioned 2018 when I

1347
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,119
spoke hop Layton was never on the radar

1348
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,480
I mean right fusarium was yeah cesarean

1349
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:18,119
was big now and probably mildew and

1350
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:22,019
patroitus which are still big now it's

1351
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:23,338
up late 2025 hopefully it's it's under

1352
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,619
control

1353
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:27,719
excellent well as long as we have people

1354
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:29,700
like you doing doing this work and

1355
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:31,858
sharing the information uh it's the best

1356
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:34,559
we can hope for thank you

1357
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:37,500
um zumir Before I Let You Go um if there

1358
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,078
are any other resources about this uh

1359
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,119
that you would like to share or

1360
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,619
um websites or anything where people can

1361
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:45,119
visit to learn more about the work that

1362
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:47,039
you're doing or maybe even just work

1363
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,720
that you're uh you're a fan of that you

1364
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,420
think would be uh apropos of the

1365
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,039
conversation please share

1366
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,440
yeah so I think I think my latest

1367
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,000
obviously is the is the can Med 23 and I

1368
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,880
think there's there's the most recent

1369
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,800
data um is presented there

1370
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,260
um definitely medicinal genomics has a

1371
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,660
is a good website for a lot of

1372
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,700
information pertaining to how viral as

1373
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:10,618
well as to make Tumi genomics has a

1374
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:12,239
really nice website that you can visit

1375
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,460
that has a lot of information on

1376
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,979
management and symptomology and so on

1377
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:19,139
and both of these Labs obviously offer

1378
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,119
testing services and there's others

1379
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:22,920
there's other labs out there that um

1380
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,260
that are obviously getting onto the

1381
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,880
bandwider there's a tremendous amount of

1382
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,800
information that's being put together on

1383
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,559
these websites in the last year I'm

1384
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,300
really impressed with with how much uh

1385
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:35,819
knowledge we have you know taken maybe

1386
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,440
from other systems and I think the

1387
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:40,019
really important part here is is the

1388
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,480
sharing the sharing of information has

1389
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:43,920
been phenomenal I mean you guys do a

1390
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,960
good job of this other you know two

1391
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,519
Regional links has done a good job we're

1392
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,139
trying to do the best but we do that

1393
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:50,940
anyway right at the University we like

1394
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,799
to share it but to see these other

1395
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,318
companies get involved is is really

1396
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,180
gratifying uh nobody's hiding anything

1397
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:59,759
nobody's keeping things to themselves

1398
00:51:57,179 --> 00:52:00,779
they're all out there discussing and and

1399
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,339
that's the way we're going to make

1400
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,540
progress and I think we are making

1401
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:06,299
progress

1402
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:07,980
