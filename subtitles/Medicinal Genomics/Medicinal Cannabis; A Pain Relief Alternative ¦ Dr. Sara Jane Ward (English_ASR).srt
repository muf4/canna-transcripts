00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:16,589
my name is Sarah Jane ward an assistant

2
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,018
professor at the Louis Katz School of

3
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:21,748
Medicine at Temple University I'm in the

4
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:24,299
center for substance abuse research also

5
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:28,588
in the department of pharmacology my

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,230
research that I do at Temple is using

7
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:34,500
animal models to study the safety and

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,200
efficacy of molecules from the cannabis

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,640
plant for many of the therapeutic

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,850
targets that we investigate in the

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,280
laboratory there are not very many

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,210
treatment options available and for some

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,100
of the disorders that were investigating

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,950
in the laboratory such as chemotherapy

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,750
induced neuropathic pain for example

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,940
there are currently no FDA approved

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,969
treatments for for this disease we think

18
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,009
it's really important to do some good

19
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,929
basic science research to see if this is

20
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:11,370
a viable treatment option that can be

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,920
approved at the 2017 can med conference

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,689
I plan to share some of the research

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,049
that I've been conducting over the last

24
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,819
several years at Temple in my own

25
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,459
laboratory in collaboration with many

26
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,429
other scientists here specifically

27
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,250
investigating the therapeutic potential

28
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,010
of different components of the plant for

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,019
the treatment of various CNS disorders

30
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,620
that specifically have an inflammatory

31
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:41,069
component to them some of the topics

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,920
that I'll be talking about are our

33
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:47,219
results in animal models of chronic pain

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,159
as well as animal models of spinal cord

35
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,978
injury traumatic brain injury and stroke

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,979
one of the reasons to attend conferences

37
00:01:52,978 --> 00:02:00,060
like the Ken med conference are to

38
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:02,188
really get an appreciation for how much

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,728
research is going on in the area of

40
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:07,649
medical cannabis one thing I'm surprised

41
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:10,019
about when I talk to people who are

42
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,900
outside of the basic science field

43
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:15,030
they're unaware that there is so much

44
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,280
research going on both at the basic

45
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,459
science and clinical level to

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,289
understand the safety concerns

47
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,080
associated with medical cannabis as well

48
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:27,849
as the potential therapeutic efficacy

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,550
that we're discovering in our research

50
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:33,280
as a substance abuse researcher I had my

51
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,920
own concerns about the abuse liability

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,800
of marijuana or different therapeutics

53
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,719
based off of marijuana and through

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,090
attending many scientific conferences

55
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,719
talking to colleagues reading scientific

56
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,650
articles

57
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:50,349
it's definitely shifted my opinions and

58
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,599
really I think almost every time I talk

59
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:55,419
to people other scientists other people

60
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,000
in the general population when when

61
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:59,619
people are exposed to the kind of

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,840
research that is going on and the kind

63
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,780
of results that are being obtained think

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,670
by and large people's attitudes are

65
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,569
shift or certainly their their minds are

66
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:33,969
opened

67
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:33,969
