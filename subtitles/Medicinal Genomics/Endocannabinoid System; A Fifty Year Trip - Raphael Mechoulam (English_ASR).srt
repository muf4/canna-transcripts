1
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,990
I would like to give you an overview of

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:20,170
cannabinoid research we have been

3
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:24,759
involved in it for the last 50 55 years

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:27,880
allow me to start by a poem by Rainer

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,660
Maria Rilke written about 120 years ago

6
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:35,109
and he said I live my life in widening

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,810
circles that reach out across the world

8
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:42,070
I may not complete the last one but I

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:44,679
give myself to it well it is as if in

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,170
some way his describing what's going on

11
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:49,869
with the cannabinoids they started with

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:53,289
a small circle and expanded and the

13
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:57,308
expansion is going on and on and on when

14
00:00:53,289 --> 00:01:00,070
we started work many years ago there was

15
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:02,108
essentially no interest in cannabinoids

16
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,088
cannabinoid research the effects of

17
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:07,960
cannabinoids the matter of fact when I

18
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:10,150
asked for a grant I was told by NIH when

19
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:14,199
you have something more relevant to the

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:16,810
u.s. contact us it cannot be known so

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,780
cannabis is not of interest it's used

22
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,900
sometimes in Mexico but not in the US

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,540
well that changed quite fast and today

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,750
there is a huge huge interest in

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,050
cannabis as a matter of fact the journal

26
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:36,700
Nature had four reviews four scientific

27
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:43,090
reviews on this topic and here is one of

28
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:45,159
them which I wrote and it shows that the

29
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,120
brain and the cannabis growing out of

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,329
the brain now why is this change why

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:56,140
when has this happened well it seems

32
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:57,909
that it cannabinoids or the endogenous

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,280
cannabinoids and I'll be talking about

34
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:05,500
them are involved in a huge amount of

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,378
diseases as a matter of fact two senior

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:12,780
scientists at NIH recently wrote a

37
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:16,378
review and the review says modulating

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:20,439
endocannabinoid activity is essentially

39
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:22,729
involved in all human diseases well even

40
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:26,139
if this is 95 percent correct

41
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:29,649
then it is something of extreme

42
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:32,419
importance and I don't know of any other

43
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,439
neurotransmitter that we can say that it

44
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:39,738
is involved in so many diseases well

45
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:42,530
I'll be talking about on this topic for

46
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:46,969
a few moments later but let's go back

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:50,979
and start with three four thousand years

48
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:53,930
ago when the Assyrians actually used

49
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:56,659
cannabinoids or use cannabis for those

50
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:01,939
purposes that you we use them today they

51
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:05,930
use cannabis to cause what they said the

52
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:09,019
drug that takes away the mind which is

53
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,510
not such a bad definition actually for

54
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:13,819
getting high they used it for some

55
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:16,159
diseases apparently neurological

56
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:19,719
diseases and it seems that they used it

57
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,389
in some of their religious rites well

58
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:25,810
when we started work and cannabinoids I

59
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:27,500
was surprised to find out that well

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:32,180
morphine

61
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:36,769
had been isolated from opium almost 200

62
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:40,310
years previously and cocaine had been

63
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:43,219
isolated from coca leaves during the

64
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,900
19th century the active compound in

65
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:50,000
cannabis had never been purified -

66
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:55,280
extracted and its structure was unknown

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,459
so we went ahead and started isolating

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,780
the compounds present in cannabis and we

69
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:05,439
found about dozen compounds and only one

70
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:10,310
of these compounds tetrahydrocannabinol

71
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:14,060
which we isolated in pure form I believe

72
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:17,000
it for the first time turned out to be

73
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,899
psychoactive all the other compounds

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,379
were of not a major interest at that

75
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:29,179
time at least well we found out that in

76
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:33,439
you a Lebanese hashish which we received

77
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,610
from the police at which we used for

78
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,379
many years

79
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:41,860
contains two major constituents

80
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:45,939
cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol THC

81
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:50,900
while THC as I said is a psychoactive

82
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:54,379
cannabidiol is not it has nothing to do

83
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:59,329
with a well-known a cannabis like

84
00:04:54,379 --> 00:05:02,030
activity but it is a major drug and many

85
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:08,778
of the diseases that are being treated

86
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:15,908
today with cannabis actually affected by

87
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:19,550
cannabidiol and much less than by THC so

88
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:24,069
we went ahead looking for the activities

89
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:27,710
of these compounds and one of the first

90
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:30,169
activities we looked at was epilepsy

91
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:33,589
this was done in collaboration with a

92
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:36,139
group in South America and we looked

93
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:39,408
first in mice and then when we had

94
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:42,740
enough data we went to humans and we

95
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:44,899
found that in a group of 15 patients

96
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:49,968
half of them were placebos didn't get

97
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:53,329
any material and half of them got CBD at

98
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:56,990
high doses those eight patients that got

99
00:05:53,329 --> 00:06:01,038
CBD 4 did not have any attacks or

100
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:04,389
essentially no attacks 3 had many less

101
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:09,889
attacks and one was not affected at all

102
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:12,740
so unfortunately these results were not

103
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:15,528
picked up by the neurologists for many

104
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,468
years and only in the last decade have

105
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:22,968
children with epilepsy being given

106
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:27,949
cannabis with high doses of cannabidiol

107
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:33,199
and a lot of them are being can I say

108
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:38,389
even saved by using this particular type

109
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:42,288
of cannabis well another group of

110
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:47,740
diseases that's being affected by

111
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:47,740
cannabidiol is graft-versus-host disease

112
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:56,329
unfortunately many cancer diseases were

113
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,680
them they should be a bone-marrow

114
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:01,319
transplant

115
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:07,189
now the body doesn't like it when a

116
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,189
bone-marrow transplant is done the body

117
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:15,510
attacks the new bone marrow the new bone

118
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:19,560
marrow attacks the body and the patient

119
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:23,149
is sick it's times very sick well but

120
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,589
this is a kind of an autoimmune disease

121
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:31,409
namely the body attacks something within

122
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:33,839
the body and so a group at one of the

123
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:37,230
hospitals here thought on the basis of

124
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:40,729
other effects which had been seen how to

125
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:43,590
immune effects of the same type

126
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:46,350
they decided to try cannabidiol

127
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:51,139
and they gave cannabidiol to a large

128
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:54,950
number of patients with that were being

129
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:59,039
that had bone marrow transplantation and

130
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:03,079
indeed in many cases they they showed

131
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:08,400
that these patients do not develop the

132
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:10,769
graft-versus-host disease and for

133
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:15,289
example here is something here some of

134
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:21,089
their results two and four grade is a

135
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:24,180
low-grade disease and while about a 50%

136
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:29,069
of patients that do not get cannabidiol

137
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:33,269
have graft-versus-host disease in a a

138
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:36,419
little bit of a mild form only a small

139
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:39,750
number only 12% of those that got

140
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,889
cannabidiol were affected those that had

141
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:47,159
a very serious graft-versus-host disease

142
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:51,379
which are about 10% only 5% got the

143
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,379
disease so here we have something

144
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:59,180
it's a clinical value of

145
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:06,389
at the moment this research is going on

146
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:09,239
and it is going on very successfully and

147
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:10,318
I sincerely believe that within a few

148
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:13,619
years

149
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:16,078
cannabidiol will become the central drug

150
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,369
the major drug in graft-versus-host

151
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:23,998
disease

152
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:26,908
now diabetes type 1 again is a outer

153
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:29,999
immune disease namely the body attacks

154
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:33,869
for reason that we do not know it takes

155
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:36,689
the cells that produce insulin and this

156
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:40,859
happens particularly in children it is

157
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:43,198
known speedy Ettrick diabetes and new

158
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:46,408
drugs are definitely needed for that

159
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:48,748
kind of disease and we tried in mice

160
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:52,168
unfortunately only we have not been able

161
00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:55,918
to get into humans yet we found that in

162
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:59,038
mice that have it all of them they

163
00:09:55,918 --> 00:10:02,908
develop diabetes type 1 if we give them

164
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:07,528
cannabidiol we can reduce the amount the

165
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:12,028
number of mice that get diabetes type 1

166
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:15,838
to about 30% if you look at the slide

167
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:18,838
you can see that the cells that produce

168
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,989
insulin and you can see that and the

169
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,849
last part of the slide the percent of

170
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:29,999
the cells that produce insulin and

171
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:33,329
partially destroyed the number is huge

172
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:37,729
77 percent of the cells are being

173
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:42,928
attacked and are not in fact anymore

174
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:45,389
those that guard cannabidiol only a 7 8

175
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:49,198
10 percent cut then the cells were

176
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:54,109
attacked so here we have a very

177
00:10:49,198 --> 00:11:00,078
promising situation for a disease that

178
00:10:54,109 --> 00:11:03,199
is not well treated nowadays these are

179
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:07,708
some of the diseases that cannabidiol

180
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:11,979
can be used for but cannabidiol has to

181
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:16,569
be used in a huge number of

182
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:19,389
a huge amount of material in in another

183
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,400
field in schizophrenia patients were

184
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:26,049
given seven to eight hundred milligrams

185
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:29,709
in order to get a good results and as it

186
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:35,439
happens with many other drugs one has to

187
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:39,220
develop derivatives which are can be

188
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,470
used at lower levels and indeed we

189
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,778
recently reported that if we take

190
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,820
cannabidiol and make a derivative a

191
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:48,939
derivative in which there is a fluorine

192
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:52,450
atom and the molecule the level the

193
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,910
amount of material needed is much lower

194
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:58,180
so I hope that within a few years we

195
00:11:54,909 --> 00:12:03,219
shall have both cannabidiol and flora

196
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:05,679
cannabidiol on the market against many

197
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:13,300
of them to immune diseases and quite a

198
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:17,189
few others now for many years after the

199
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:19,838
chemistry of cannabinoids became known

200
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,360
we learned about the biochemistry the

201
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,279
pharmacology as I mentioned a few

202
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,740
clinical effects one thing that we

203
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:32,458
didn't know was what is the mechanism of

204
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:35,830
cannabis action whether it's THC or CBD

205
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:38,139
but particularly THC what is the

206
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,740
mechanism it was thought previously that

207
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:42,429
the mechanism is none specific whatever

208
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,209
that means

209
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:50,489
well nonspecific means that we cannot

210
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:55,269
really find any well-established

211
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:58,360
mechanism well this is how the one does

212
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:05,549
we'll look for nonspecific mechanism if

213
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:09,100
we have a molecule that can exist into

214
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:14,829
two types if you wish mirror images of

215
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:17,620
each other a nonspecific mode of action

216
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:20,170
both molecules will act for a specific

217
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:23,320
mode of action only one of them will act

218
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:25,689
well we found that indeed only the

219
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,770
natural cannot be dial

220
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:35,140
the natural THC work the mirror image

221
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:38,980
does not so we so we established that

222
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:41,919
there will be some specific mechanism

223
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,519
and indeed within a few years and in

224
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:48,819
howl it in the US found a receptor the

225
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,620
receptor was found in the brain and it

226
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:56,710
is widely spread in the brain probably

227
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,230
one of the most one of the air receptors

228
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,960
that fountain the highest amounts in the

229
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,240
brain but receptors don't exist because

230
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:08,470
there is a plant out there receptors a

231
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,759
disease because animals we produce

232
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,680
compounds that affect these receptors so

233
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,259
we went ahead looking for the compounds

234
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:20,139
in our body endogenous compounds which

235
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:24,929
will affect these receptors and after

236
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:27,220
work for quite a few years with

237
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:29,500
colleagues that came from the state and

238
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,730
a colleague that came from the Czech

239
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,080
State

240
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:38,529
we found a compound called which we

241
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:42,370
called Ananda mite and we found also

242
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:46,000
another compound which we called a - AG

243
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:49,049
these compounds found throughout the

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,490
body and particularly in the brain and

245
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:54,399
particularly in those areas of the brain

246
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,519
which you can see on the slide where the

247
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,590
receptor is found and these two

248
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,019
compounds have a completely different

249
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:06,370
structure than the natural / than the

250
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:08,529
natural plant product but they are they

251
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,320
have the same activity more or less and

252
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:13,209
they also like the plant Pradhan do not

253
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,960
dissolve in water they dissolve only

254
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:19,180
lipids and they act in the same way with

255
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,210
one difference they are formed when

256
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:24,909
needed they're broken when needed but

257
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:28,480
the plant material stays for a longer

258
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:32,259
period of time so there has been a huge

259
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:38,620
huge amount of work and are you you call

260
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:39,370
this particular research as the second

261
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,039
phase

262
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,340
of Cannavino it research the first phase

263
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,889
is the work on the plant canopy noise

264
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,620
the second phase is the work on the

265
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:52,539
endogenous cannabinoids and I will not

266
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:57,759
go into biochemistry of course oh except

267
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:59,799
one thing why are these compounds

268
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,139
whether it is the plant compound or

269
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,019
whether it these are the compounds that

270
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:10,509
we produce the endogenous cannabinoids

271
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:14,799
effective in so many a biological things

272
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:19,330
why are in so many diseases well one

273
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:21,299
thing they do is they regulate the

274
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:25,990
activities of many other

275
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:28,439
neurotransmitters a nerve is not a

276
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:32,279
string going from one place to another

277
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,740
nerves in the body are broken down and

278
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:38,799
that's called a synapse and the synapse

279
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:42,279
is in our body because in this way the

280
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:46,779
body can regulate nerve activity now the

281
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:48,730
synapse there is a there are chemicals

282
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:51,850
which move from one side to design it to

283
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,800
another these are the neuro compounds

284
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:57,330
that are neurotransmitters

285
00:16:53,799 --> 00:17:01,240
well the endogenous cannabinoids

286
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:06,640
regulate the release of these compounds

287
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:09,339
they sit on the part of the sine X

288
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,030
cosine it's called when needed they move

289
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:18,609
to the pre synapse and there they

290
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:20,980
activate a receptor and a affect the

291
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:23,049
production of the release these

292
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,860
neurotransmitters the bottom line is

293
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:29,109
they endogenous cannabinoids regulate to

294
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,289
a large extent what's going on in the

295
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:34,539
brain was going on with

296
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:37,210
neurotransmitters so to make a long

297
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:40,269
story short the andhaka

298
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,640
endogenous cannabinoids sister today is

299
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:46,720
known to have two receptors the cb1

300
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,630
receptor is the one when stimulated

301
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,230
causes the activity the cannabinoid

302
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:56,480
activity the second one is a protective

303
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,210
is of a protective nature and it has

304
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,190
nothing to do with a psychoactivity of

305
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,590
cannabis then of course there are the

306
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:07,910
two endogenous compounds an endermite

307
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:10,129
and two AG and I talked about them there

308
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:13,070
of course that enzymes those enzymes

309
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,830
that form the endogenous compounds and

310
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:18,230
also enzymes that break them down and by

311
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:22,159
playing with these enzymes we can

312
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:24,620
actually and has the activity and hence

313
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,790
the amount of the endogenous compounds

314
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:32,569
or we can even leave them for a much

315
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:34,700
longer time in the body by blocking the

316
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,339
enzymes that break them down and of

317
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,289
course there is the THC and cannabidiol

318
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:46,089
so there is a huge amount of work going

319
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:50,149
on and these compounds and know now to

320
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:54,769
affect as I said previously a long list

321
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:58,460
of things that are going on in our body

322
00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:00,730
and if you can look at the list that I

323
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,890
have on this slide it starts with

324
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,750
anxiety in blood pressure and the

325
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,540
digestive system etcetera etcetera

326
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:11,390
etcetera and it goes down to stress and

327
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:15,799
if I have a full list I'll probably need

328
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:18,170
another two or three slides now let me

329
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,750
tell you some of the activity of the

330
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,509
endogenous compounds one of the

331
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,200
activities of the endogenous compounds

332
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:29,890
is a protective effective 'ti a

333
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,630
protective activity in the brain

334
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:36,620
together with a colleague of mine

335
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:43,040
professor St Shore Army no we looked at

336
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:46,399
what happens to the brain when it has

337
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:49,159
been slightly damaged brain of mice and

338
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,430
we found that one of the endogenous

339
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,790
compounds the two AG and it is in the

340
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:58,870
red on the slide you have the two AG

341
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:02,420
goes up about ten times after even a

342
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:05,059
slight damage to the brain now is that

343
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,538
because the brain has been damaged and

344
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:07,428
it doesn't

345
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,679
do what it should do what is that some

346
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:12,859
kind of a protective mechanism so we

347
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:17,509
synthesized to a G and gave it to mice

348
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:21,618
that had undergone closed head injury

349
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:25,368
and we found that indeed those mice that

350
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:27,618
received cannabidiol had much less

351
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:30,319
damage in the brain the damage can be

352
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:34,579
seen in the white part in the slide in

353
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:40,460
the brain if the damage goes about 50%

354
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:43,749
less so here we have a typical effect of

355
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:48,649
the endogenous cannabinoids neuro

356
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:51,169
protection and we we and many other

357
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:54,498
groups looked at a huge number of

358
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:57,049
effects but some of them the effects

359
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:59,259
with not as strong as we expected for

360
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:02,089
example on brain injury there is

361
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:04,460
vasoconstriction of the blood vessels

362
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:06,408
and the endogenous cannabinoids to

363
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,629
affect whether constriction and

364
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:12,799
vasoconstriction is part of the damage

365
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:15,589
but they but the body seems to act to

366
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:19,489
have something that effects much more

367
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:22,209
that the brain so we started looking for

368
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:25,340
maybe we have additional compounds

369
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:29,379
additional end of cannabinoids and

370
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:34,209
indeed we found that their compounds

371
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:40,719
that are closely related to the

372
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:42,889
endocannabinoids but do not act as

373
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,989
endocannabinoid they do not bind to the

374
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:47,538
receptor they do not have many other

375
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:50,479
activities but they definitely act on

376
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:54,079
the vasoconstriction and one compound of

377
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:57,528
this type as you can see on the slide it

378
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,569
is closely related to the other compound

379
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:03,558
but it doesn't bind to the receptor it

380
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:05,989
is formed from a fatty acid bound to an

381
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:10,038
amino acid amino acid in this case is

382
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:13,090
serine and this particular compound we

383
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:15,829
see it and it has been accepted as a

384
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:17,418
endocannabinoid like compound found in

385
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:20,838
the body and

386
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:23,409
today we know that there is a huge huge

387
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:26,298
number of compounds of that type about

388
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:28,099
120 compounds at that time and we know

389
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:31,999
very little about the activities of

390
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:36,648
these compounds for example in this case

391
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:39,108
we know in that as I spoke about era as

392
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:41,569
RF you don't need searing it is not bind

393
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:44,449
to the receptor but its activity can be

394
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:47,088
blocked by an antagonist to the receptor

395
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,459
very strange because how can a compound

396
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:51,499
which does not bind to the receptor can

397
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:53,869
be blocked by an antagonist we don't

398
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:56,749
know why this happens but on the other

399
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:59,538
hand that's what it does so there is

400
00:22:56,749 --> 00:23:02,259
something that we have to look at in a

401
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:09,338
completely different area bone

402
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:09,338
remodeling we were surprised to see that

403
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:16,459
osteoporosis can be affected by

404
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:19,118
compounds of this type this has a long

405
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:24,078
history it is known in the Middle East

406
00:23:19,118 --> 00:23:27,168
that there is less osteoporosis then in

407
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:32,358
northern Europe and it is believed that

408
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:33,709
this happens because people in in the

409
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:38,418
Middle East

410
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:41,959
use more olive oil than others so we

411
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:43,788
looked at the presence of compounds of

412
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:46,278
this type in olive oil and we didn't

413
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:49,158
find anything but then we decided many

414
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:51,499
maybe one of the constituents of olive

415
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:55,489
oil in this case a compound called oleic

416
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:58,129
acid is metabolized in the body to a

417
00:23:55,489 --> 00:24:03,229
compound that's very active and so we

418
00:23:58,128 --> 00:24:08,418
prepared a few metabolites new compounds

419
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:10,639
and yes we found that a compound closely

420
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:13,219
related to an and amide and you can see

421
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:17,508
in the slide the structure of an animai

422
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:21,588
and the structure of this metabolite of

423
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:24,348
oleic acid serine which does not bind to

424
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:29,108
the receptor does not cause the effects

425
00:24:24,348 --> 00:24:29,108
of an and amide but is a very potent

426
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:37,069
a compound if we have mice and we cause

427
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:42,769
osteoporosis in mice and our ways of

428
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:44,898
doing it and bones are affected and you

429
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:48,288
can see in the middle the red is the

430
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:53,148
affected bones if we start giving these

431
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:55,638
mice this particular a cannabinoid like

432
00:24:53,148 --> 00:24:57,739
compound formed in the body formed in

433
00:24:55,638 --> 00:25:00,979
the bones we can see that the bones

434
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:05,079
start recovering they are start re

435
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:08,990
growing ahead so here we have a huge

436
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:11,329
number of biological physiological

437
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,638
effects that have to be looked at

438
00:25:11,329 --> 00:25:15,648
because we know as I've mentioned

439
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:17,808
previously that there are almost a

440
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:21,489
hundred and twenty compounds of this

441
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:25,190
type and we have looked at these two and

442
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:28,038
there are some many others that have to

443
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:32,950
be evaluated so let me try to summarize

444
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:36,558
what I have been talking about first the

445
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:41,720
endocannabinoids are involved in a huge

446
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:47,200
number of biological effects and we can

447
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:50,240
expect to have a to see many others as

448
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,840
many many groups are working in the

449
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,609
field we know that cannabidiol is an

450
00:25:53,839 --> 00:26:00,829
important compound although it doesn't

451
00:25:55,609 --> 00:26:04,278
cause the well-known effects of cannabis

452
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:06,288
and there is the third group of

453
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:10,579
compounds that people are just looking

454
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:14,000
into now and these are Ananda might like

455
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:17,178
compounds which are like Ananda might

456
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,700
formed from a fatty acid bound to an

457
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:23,028
amino acid or a derivative of amino acid

458
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:26,929
in these compounds seem to be effective

459
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:32,089
in a huge number of physiological

460
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:34,429
processes and I sincerely hope that

461
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:39,220
within the next three years we shall see

462
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:42,309
drugs particularly of this third type of

463
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,480
endocannabinoid like compounds and of

464
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:47,529
calm

465
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:53,860
that specifically under cb2 system which

466
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:56,399
has no marijuana like effects I would

467
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:58,659
like to thank many of my collaborators

468
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,450
this is a list of some of my

469
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,460
collaborators in Israel some of them of

470
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:08,529
my students some of them are colleagues

471
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:12,850
in departments and we want to say thanks

472
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:15,910
to many other colleagues abroad you can

473
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:20,189
see in the slide some of my

474
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:24,850
collaborators abroad and they conceded

475
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:28,150
they stretch from the UK in Aberdeen my

476
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:31,389
good friend Perth way through the Czech

477
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:38,320
State and Greece and Richemont

478
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:41,020
in the US and even Siberia I visited all

479
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,950
these places set Siberia it's too cold

480
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:43,950
for me thank you

481
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,980
you
