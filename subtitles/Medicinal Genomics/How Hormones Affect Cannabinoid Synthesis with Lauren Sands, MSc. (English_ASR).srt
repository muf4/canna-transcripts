00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,080
workshops

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,959
this episode's guest is Lauren Sands

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,000
Lauren is a senior laboratory technician

58
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,439
at safetiva labs in Westfield

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,598
Massachusetts

60
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,120
she works in both the biological and

61
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,299
chemical side of operations utilizing

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,379
PCR and chromatography to test cannabis

63
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,900
products

64
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:45,419
Laura received her Ms in plant science

65
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,760
with a focus in cannabis molecular

66
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,759
biology at the University of Connecticut

67
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,280
where she focused on how hormones affect

68
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,979
cannabinoid production

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,959
during our conversation we discuss the

70
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,079
process for how cannabis plants create

71
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,719
cannabinoids what role hormones play in

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,640
the cannabinoid synthase process

73
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,459
whether a hormone treatment could

74
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,679
increase cannabinoid levels the ethics

75
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,620
around treating plants with exogenous

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,500
hormones and how understanding hormones

77
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,480
can help guide breeders to create new

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,459
cannabis varieties

79
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,619
before we get to my conversation with

80
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,439

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,800
good morning Lauren thanks so much for

99
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,600
joining us on the podcast

100
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,520
evening Ben thank you so much for having

101
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,020
me

102
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,758
of course yeah I'm actually really

103
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,500
excited to talk with you today because

104
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
you're going to be presenting some

105
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,879
pretty important findings at cambod23

106
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,219
this may that could help Growers

107
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,300
increase cannabinoid synthase in their

108
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,000
plants

109
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,978
but first I think to really understand

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,540
the work that you've done and what this

111
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:47,579
all means we should really lay some

112
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,740
groundwork for those who maybe aren't

113
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:53,039
familiar with how cannabis plants

114
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,780
produce cannabinoids so I was wondering

115
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,699
if to start could you give us a bit of a

116
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,779
Layman's explanation of how that process

117
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,220
works

118
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,219
absolutely so

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,819
and trichomes are small hairs on the

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,500
epidermis of the plant and so cannabis

121
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,779
plants make six different types of

122
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,000
trichomes but only three of these are

123
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,739
what we're really interested in these

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,860
three produce resin

125
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,560
and so these three are called capitate

126
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,900
stalked capitate sessile and bulbous

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,459
trichomes but we're we're really

128
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,319
interested in the capitate stock

129
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,180
trichomes those are like the mushroom

130
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,379
looking ones that really that's what

131
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,459
we're looking for in the plant that's

132
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,639
what's going to give us the most

133
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:38,939
cannabinoids the most rich resin

134
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,038
um for cultivators Growers anybody using

135
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:44,100
a cannabis plant

136
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:46,560
so as the female plant develops after

137
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,259
switching into the 12-12 agitated phase

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,120
more trichomes are produced and within

139
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,860
them the cannabinoids and terpenes are

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,100
produced alongside

141
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,500
so these trichomes are like factories

142
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,879
for cannabinoids and terpenes and during

143
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,639
flowering

144
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,639
here's where we get a little scientific

145
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,220
um there are two active enzymatic

146
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,100
Pathways working together at the base of

147
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,199
this head of the glandular trichome so

148
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,520
remember it looks like a mushroom and so

149
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
at the top we have the head of the

150
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,379
mushroom it looks like a little bold

151
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,720
so in the base of this trichome head

152
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,418
there's a rosette of cells and they

153
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,180
contain little organelles and so in

154
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:29,219
these rosette cells the organelles these

155
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,319
pathways are producing the precursors

156
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,600
that are needed for Downstream

157
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:38,879
cannabinoid production to in the end

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,860
make thca cbda and so in these small

159
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,319
organelles in the base of the trichome

160
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,379
head there's a precursor called

161
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:50,240
olivitalic acid and so this all of

162
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,439
italic acid is converted to cbga

163
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,759
cannabidrolic acid

164
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:59,038
and so cbda this is a cannabinoid in and

165
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,960
of itself but it's also a precursor for

166
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,579
many cannabinoids

167
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,918
and so

168
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:07,859
um you can use it as a medicinal benefit

169
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:11,579
but also you can the plant uses it to

170
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,759
produce thca and cbda

171
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,459
so this process of converting all of

172
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:20,520
italic acid to cbga is completed by an

173
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,500
enzyme so this enzyme is what I say for

174
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,680
my whole two years of my masters and

175
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,079
it's called prenal transferase and so

176
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,780
these are just little enzymes in the

177
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,219
trichomes but there's 10 of them in the

178
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:35,098
cannabis plant

179
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,400
and so there's really two that the

180
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:40,740
industry is focusing on it's just one in

181
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,060
four prenial transferase one and preno

182
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,780
transferase four

183
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,180
so this enzyme causes the reaction

184
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,138
between the olive atolic acid I

185
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,098
mentioned

186
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:58,740
and another substrate another Gene

187
00:07:53,098 --> 00:08:02,519
called gpps and so this other gpps

188
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,319
um substrate is actually gears in two

189
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,839
directions so One Direction it actually

190
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,439
makes terpenes and then in the other

191
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,779
direction it's used in this reaction to

192
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,620
basically combine with olivitoic acid

193
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:19,859
and that produces cbga and so now we

194
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,300
have cbga in this rosette in the head of

195
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,479
the trichome

196
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,780
so after it's produced after this penal

197
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:30,598
transfers enzyme finishes its reaction

198
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,639
um it's basically transported into the

199
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,139
top of the head of the trichome now so

200
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,580
there's a base and then there's the top

201
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:41,819
and so now it's exported and cbga is the

202
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,278
precursor to our endpoint cannabinoids

203
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,839
and so with the help of certain enzymes

204
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:49,559
which you've probably heard about such

205
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,260
as thca synthase cbda synthase these

206
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:56,399
enzymes are taking cvga and converting

207
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:58,259
them to what we want thca cbda and

208
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,360
likewise with other cannabinoids such as

209
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,019
CBC CBN

210
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,019
and then there's other

211
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,940
genes and enzymes working there

212
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,278
so um

213
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,320
these enzymes produce the final acidic

214
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:20,899
forms of cannabinoids which are ready to

215
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,899
be used by individuals or used by

216
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,120
and so to tie it all back to like why is

217
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:31,199
the cannabis plant making cannabinoids

218
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,879
we understand all the how but these

219
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,420
cannabinoids are known to actually be

220
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:39,299
toxic to the cell and in the in the

221
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:42,179
trichome head so a byproduct of making

222
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:44,879
these cannabinoids is hydrogen peroxide

223
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:46,139
and so they don't want it in the base of

224
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,600
the cell it's going to kill the cell so

225
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:50,939
they want to export it to the to the

226
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,200
extracellular reservoir to get it away

227
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,800
from the plant

228
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,778
and so um the all the resin containing

229
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,299
the cannabinoids and terpenes are in the

230
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:02,338
top of the trichome head and so whenever

231
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,639
they break open

232
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:08,700
um one you smell all the terpenes you

233
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,500
smell the plant but also it's a sticky

234
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,160
resin that

235
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:17,419
um can be used to trap insects and also

236
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,419
the terpenes have antifung

237
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,100
Ally it's like a little

238
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,580
oh so if it it opens it can trap insects

239
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,379
it can protect the plant it can collect

240
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,778
the pollen

241
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,620
um and also

242
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:34,379
um

243
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,940
yeah honestly that's the why and how of

244
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,919
cannabinoid production in the plant the

245
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,380
intricate Pathways lead to a defense

246
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,639
against herbivory as well as a treat for

247
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,240
us humans

248
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:47,039
wow no that's that's awesome that was a

249
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,740
great explanation thank you so a lot

250
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,139
going on there's a lot going on here

251
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,459
um so I jotted down a few notes when you

252
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,620
were talking here and so do I understand

253
00:10:53,458 --> 00:11:00,419
this correct where it's the same gene

254
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:02,459
that creates cbga also creates trichomes

255
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,719
um it doesn't actually create dry cones

256
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:07,799
so the trichomes just grow oh

257
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,459
you're fine

258
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:14,939
um so there's the enzyme that actually

259
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,619
produces cpga doesn't produce

260
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,620
um

261
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:22,919
terpenes but the the enzyme is using a

262
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,278
substrate that it's taking a substrate

263
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:29,099
from this gpps but then the gpps enzyme

264
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,620
is the beginning of the terpene

265
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,459
production it's basically

266
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,578
it's basically what cbga is to thca to

267
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,259
PPS is to terpene so it's just precursor

268
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:41,939
so but like it's really cool you're

269
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:43,679
seeing the two Pathways combine and then

270
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,560
kind of Go off into terpenes or

271
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,299
cannabinoids right and it's this whole

272
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,879
process of you know this this whole

273
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:52,439
pathway of creating cannabinoids that's

274
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,600
really kind of the basis of your work

275
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,140
here and kind of the

276
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,120
um

277
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,860
the foundation again for your findings

278
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,240
so all right let's stop beating around

279
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,159
the bush now that we've laid some

280
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,740
groundwork so tell us a bit about you

281
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,719
know what's the what's the main takeaway

282
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,579
um of your research here and why we

283
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,639
should be excited about it

284
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:13,259
so there's so many different aspects to

285
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,899
my research

286
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:18,480
um there's a lot of aspects before I

287
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,639
entered the lab the actual actually the

288
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,519
lab is the birkwood side at UConn I want

289
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,379
to uh give a call out to them so we did

290
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,720
all this research together

291
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:30,179
um we started a while ago basically

292
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,800
figuring out which genes produce which

293
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,659
cannabinoids which ones we should be

294
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,799
looking at

295
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,778
um

296
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,639
we'd have to go through all my research

297
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:42,019
to get to the end of why it's really

298
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,879
important but really I'm helping

299
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:47,278
scientists understand why the plant is

300
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,039
making cannabinoids as we'll get into a

301
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,220
bit later which hormones in the plant

302
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,139
are right decide like basically telling

303
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,700
the plant to make cannabinoids and then

304
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,980
also The Growers are beginning to

305
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,759
understand which genes we want to look

306
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,680
at

307
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,838
which will help us determine which

308
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,278
cannabinoids are going to be produced

309
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,600
um when they're going to be produced

310
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,039
whether we're going to increase or

311
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,959
decrease it

312
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,379
um a big thing is that we're figuring

313
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:16,379
out which genes can uh Downstream make

314
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:19,019
thca if we have hemp Growers we want to

315
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,659
reduce the amount of THC produced in the

316
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:23,278
plants they'll know what to do with

317
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,860
those genes if they want to like reduce

318
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,539
the amount of hormones going in

319
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,659
eventually down the road people will get

320
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:33,419
to like Gene editing and I know GMO in

321
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:35,639
cannabis plants is a big controversy but

322
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:37,799
it is possible it will be possible

323
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,500
eventually to genetically modify our

324
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:43,439
plants and potentially like knock out

325
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,019
genes so they don't produce THC so our

326
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,480
lab is really focusing on why the plant

327
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,560
makes THC and CBD

328
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,560
yeah

329
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,018
yeah and so in reading your abstract in

330
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,399
in a bit of the paper in in preparation

331
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,959
for this and just to learn more about

332
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,480
what's going to be presented at cambed

333
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,699
23 my main takeaway was it seems like

334
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,519
your team has identified a potential

335
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,459
hormone treatment that can increase

336
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,919
cannabinoid synthase is that correct

337
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:14,059
we yes

338
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,059
um we've looked at a bunch of different

339
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:21,599
the main hormone I looked at during my

340
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:26,099
research was is salicylic acid which is

341
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,560
a plant defense hormone so I went

342
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,600
through and um

343
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,399
I looked at a variety of different

344
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,600
things throughout the throughout the

345
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,360
plant so I looked at the promoter of

346
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,100
this prenal transfers 4 enzyme that I

347
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,100
mentioned and so if you don't know what

348
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,100
a promoter is it's this stretch of DNA

349
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,778
right before a gene which determines if

350
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,399
the gene is going to be activated or

351
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:52,860
repressed or if nothing's going to

352
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,019
happen so all of our genes in our bodies

353
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,639
and the plants are just hanging out

354
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,480
something needs to tell them to turn on

355
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,120
or like work less and so I looked at the

356
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,079
promoters of these enzymes and I figured

357
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,659
out

358
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,239
there are certain elements within this

359
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:12,179
promoter that are responsive to hormones

360
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,759
so basically if hormones are released

361
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,919
they'll activate certain Pathways to

362
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:21,059
then trigger a gene to turn on

363
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,759
and so I found out that this Gene this

364
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,679
enzyme that produces cbga I found out

365
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,240
that it's quite responsive to salicylic

366
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,739
acid treatment

367
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,379
and

368
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,539
um so I did two studies one I figured

369
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:36,299
out that the promoter can be activated

370
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:38,219
at high levels following treatment from

371
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:42,179
salicylic acid

372
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,860
and I also did full plant studies so the

373
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,379
promoter studies were just little gene

374
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,980
cloning tiny studies but the plant

375
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:53,278
studies were full flowering plants

376
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:56,399
um a wife hemp cultivar and so I also

377
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:59,100
gave the plants a root trench of

378
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,078
containing salicylic acid

379
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,699
and so in both cases we saw the

380
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,519
promoters activated which will

381
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:08,759
Downstream produce more cbga and more

382
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:14,399
thca and then also in the actual plants

383
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:17,819
we saw that through qpcr and examining

384
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,860
messenger RNA expression we saw that a

385
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,680
lot of the genes in the cannabinoid

386
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,079
synthesis pathway were activated at

387
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,958
larger levels than without the treatment

388
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:28,739
so we saw like

389
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,479
um

390
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,980
the Primal transferase genes were

391
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,259
activated at much higher levels after

392
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,339
being treated with salicylic acid we saw

393
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,679
that

394
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:40,019
the cbda and thca synthase genes were

395
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,419
activated large levels so really we're

396
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:44,759
seeing that this hormone can activate

397
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,879
these cannabinoid synthesis genes at

398
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,980
larger levels than normal so we've also

399
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,679
seen increased cannabinoid content in

400
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,560
the plants a lot of my research goes

401
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:58,799
into why the genes are activated not so

402
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,419
much can I get more THC out of the plant

403
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,679
um okay yeah I really want to know like

404
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,078
why the plant's doing what it's doing

405
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,980
not how can I get the most THC out of

406
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,119
the plant but I know that's what the

407
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,519
Growers form

408
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,639
right yeah

409
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,798
so so basically kind of introducing more

410
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,640
of this hormone is like a signal to the

411
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,779
plant to create more cbga which then

412
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,000
eventually is going to make it

413
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:25,259
Downstream to to turn into potentially

414
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,359
more cannabinoids correct yep yep

415
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:29,039
um yeah so that that can be the case

416
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,439
with a lot of hormones

417
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,159
um I also saw

418
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,940
um

419
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,860
a large response from one hormone called

420
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,019
cytokinin which some Growers can give to

421
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:42,418
their plants

422
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,679
basically just improves growth so that

423
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,240
can be the case for that as well

424
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,660
basically anything that's going to

425
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,940
activate this promoter is a really good

426
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,038
um source to potentially improve your

427
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,400
plants

428
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,859
um I actually one of the stemming

429
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,080
points of my research was from a

430
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:03,119
cannabis Forum where I just looked up

431
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:05,899
Growers and they're like yeah I've given

432
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,899
aspirin to my

433
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,519
style of silica acid and so they're

434
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,439
basic people have been doing this

435
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,200
already so they're actually giving their

436
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,058
plants little tablets of aspirin like

437
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,740
dissolving it giving it to the roots and

438
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:22,500
seeing improved plants so this has

439
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,859
already been done in like people's

440
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,319
basements and closets but we just we're

441
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,879
just making the research and Publishing

442
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,339
it so that it's actually known

443
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,539
throughout the world

444
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,240
um yeah

445
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:38,279
yeah and that's it's funny that's such a

446
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,380
common thing that we find like when I'm

447
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,418
talking to researchers

448
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,940
um is that they're sort of

449
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,700
they're explaining the why for some of

450
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,320
these little tricks or treatments that

451
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,419
you know these Legacy Growers who have

452
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,099
been doing it for so long may have

453
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,440
already figured out but maybe didn't

454
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,418
always understand what's what's going on

455
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,720
inside the plant to make that work and

456
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:03,419
so it's really cool to see how you know

457
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,480
Academia or more you know traditional

458
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,580
science is coming along and you know

459
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,558
first of all confirming what what these

460
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,659
folks have been seeing anecdotally and

461
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,399
then actually explaining what's going on

462
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,558
yeah

463
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,840
so I think that's a that's you know a

464
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,579
really important thing that we're seeing

465
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,859
in the industry and it's a it's a great

466
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,480
thing that I'm glad that can Med can be

467
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:27,178
a part of that we can sort of be pushing

468
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,099
this forward yeah so

469
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,240
I guess I do want to come back to this

470
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:32,240
idea of like okay

471
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,759
is there potentially a hormone treatment

472
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,640
that we might be able to figure out that

473
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,140
you know Growers can use to increase

474
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,460
their cannabinoid production are we

475
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,600
there yet or are we still in the early

476
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,538
stages

477
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,579
so I'd say we're still in the early

478
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:52,200
stages because

479
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:54,298
um you wouldn't really think it but

480
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,860
actually giving your plants hormones can

481
00:19:54,298 --> 00:20:00,418
be like considered

482
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:03,319
like non-organic excuse me not organic

483
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,700
um like unethical

484
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:08,519
and because you're changing the natural

485
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,740
composition of the plant like a lot of

486
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,839
these Growers they've

487
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,240
gotten to where they are because they

488
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,798
care for the plant they want it to do

489
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,380
its own thing they just want to

490
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,139
encourage it so giving it external fact

491
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,080
like exogenous hormones giving changing

492
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,720
its natural composition is a big maybe

493
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,939
no no from some people I know in like

494
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,558
the big Industries people would see that

495
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,179
and be like oh yes let's give all the

496
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,240
plants sounds like

497
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:39,000
other hormone and just like pump the

498
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,519
plant as much as we can but then you can

499
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,140
like kind of relate that to say like the

500
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,579
chicken industry where they're pumping

501
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,720
the chickens full they want to get as

502
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:49,678
much out of the product and they don't

503
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,720
care about the the cute the organisms

504
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,400
anymore and so

505
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,259
I think we are getting to the point

506
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,419
where we could give the plants hormones

507
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,160
but it has to be done in a really smart

508
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,380
way

509
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:05,279
um you can do a mix of hormones my old

510
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,960
my co-worker at UConn was giving the

511
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,759
plants a mix of different hormones and

512
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,880
seeing the outcome of that and that was

513
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:14,879
actually a really good study so like he

514
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:19,140
was mixing like cytokine and South acid

515
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:22,080
and methyl Jasmine and seeing improved

516
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,120
plants and cannabinoid content so I

517
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,240
think I think in the next few years

518
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,939
we're getting out these studies some

519
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,659
companies are actually patenting these

520
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,880
uh hormone treatments I know CT Pharma

521
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,980
in Connecticut patented our Labs

522
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,500
methylgasmine a application to the

523
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,599
plants because they saw increased growth

524
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,579
and everything so I think if it's done

525
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,639
in an ethical way people care about

526
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:49,558
their plants they don't give it too much

527
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,299
of the constant like give it the right

528
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,158
concentrations of the hormones because

529
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:54,839
too much will definitely create toxic

530
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,220
effects

531
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,379
um and of course not too little because

532
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,659
then you won't see anything but yeah I

533
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,220
think it's a good

534
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,980
uh

535
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:09,298
good idea moving forward especially like

536
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,519
not going straight to like these all

537
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:13,319
like really non-organic methods of

538
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,000
helping the plants like because the

539
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,939
plants already have the hormones going

540
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,460
throughout them so right like it's in my

541
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,320
mind I think it's okay I think it's

542
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,538
totally fine to like increase it a

543
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,619
little bit but like

544
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:28,558
um

545
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:31,379
as I was thinking before like salicylic

546
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:34,379
acid is produced as a defense mechanism

547
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,020
in the plant so you don't want to like

548
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,059
pose a threat to the plant so that just

549
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:40,440
so it produces more salicylic acid to

550
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:42,538
produce more cannabinoids like you have

551
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,580
to do it in the right way of giving it

552
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:46,980
the salicylic acid not scaring the plant

553
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:48,960
you know right yeah

554
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,940
there's there's a point of diminishing

555
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,740
returns right where you're doing more

556
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:57,360
harm than good yeah I think so

557
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,579
no that's interesting I mean and then

558
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,019
you know I I wonder and you could tell

559
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,879
me if I'm on bit off base here like

560
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,859
would there be something like even

561
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,679
further Downstream like instead of just

562
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:09,719
like giving the hormone straight to the

563
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,980
plant is there something else that can

564
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,079
be

565
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,000
um provided maybe like in certain forms

566
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,339
of nutrients or whatever that will sort

567
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,740
of naturally raise their

568
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:22,619
um levels of these of these hormones

569
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:24,960
that would kind of more naturally create

570
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:26,819
what you're what you're looking for yeah

571
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,159
absolutely I think that's kind of

572
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,418
already in the market so like a lot of

573
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,960
what these

574
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:36,120
um nutrients and like help grow like I'm

575
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,620
not a grower I'm a scientist so I'm not

576
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,879
I don't know all the like products and

577
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,158
stuff

578
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,600
um but a lot of these nutrient products

579
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,600
that they're giving the plants are

580
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:50,158
actually going to increase hormones so

581
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:53,219
like a lot of the like increased growth

582
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:57,000
um external administering things to the

583
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,880
plants will help increase oxen which is

584
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,480
a growth hormone so really in the end

585
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,440
people have like they don't have these

586
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,200
products and they're going to be like oh

587
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,820
this directly increases this hormone the

588
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,819
like it's going to increase a bunch of

589
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:13,379
hormones it creates I mean hormones work

590
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:15,480
in an orchestra they're all working

591
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,780
together some repressed some work

592
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,558
together some you know so I think people

593
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:25,079
are already working on that like

594
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:27,000
giving plants products is going to

595
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:30,359
change their hormone networks it's going

596
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,339
to increase decrease it so yeah

597
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:34,558
yeah but then kind of going back to what

598
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:36,599
we were talking about earlier like

599
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,000
with these findings it's sort of just

600
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,379
like another way that we could measure

601
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,538
whether or not these products are

602
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,220
working right if we see an uptick of

603
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:45,658
these certain hormones that we know that

604
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,519
are going to help Downstream to create

605
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,840
more cannabinoids be like well we might

606
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,400
be onto something with this formulation

607
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,579
here because we're seeing this uptick

608
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,840
yeah yeah it all comes back to the

609
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:57,500
beginning like everybody's working

610
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:57,500
together in this

611
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:05,640
to look at for uh these cannabis plants

612
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,619
especially with how little knowledge is

613
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,880
actually out there

614
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,379
um I think it's a really good start

615
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,880
place to start looking at these genes

616
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,880
Growers looking at them like getting

617
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,799
more with their plan understanding when

618
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,140
hormones are produced during flowering

619
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:24,418
how to increase or decrease it based on

620
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,880
their environment yeah

621
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:29,220
yeah so you know I'm thinking that this

622
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,400
could be very useful information for you

623
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,079
know nutrient developers to you know as

624
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,298
part of their r d to be looking at

625
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,220
whether the hormone levels are raised so

626
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:40,139
yeah very cool

627
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,519
um I know one thing that we also kind of

628
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,259
when we were chatting over email before

629
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,298
before we were doing this one thing that

630
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:48,480
you mentioned too about these findings

631
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:50,460
is not only could it help you know

632
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,558
figure out how to increase cannabinoid

633
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,298
content but maybe potentially decrease

634
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,658
as well I was wondering if you could

635
00:25:54,298 --> 00:26:01,500
kind of speak to that a bit yeah so

636
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,580
um there's a few points I'll make here

637
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,859
um

638
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,960
kind of going back to the promoter talk

639
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:08,519
because that's what I studied for two

640
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,440
years

641
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,079
um there's so there's parts of the

642
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,298
promoter that will activate the gene

643
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:19,379
those parts of the promoters that will

644
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:22,859
repress the Gene and so these hormones

645
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,900
they can a lot of them will activate the

646
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:27,899
gene increase the transcription to make

647
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,059
proteins to make it usable but some of

648
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,440
them will repress it and not let the

649
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:34,200
genes work

650
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,019
and so if you find out which hormones

651
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,200
are going to repress say the THC

652
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:42,119
synthase Gene the prenal transfers all

653
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,340
these enzymes then you can administer

654
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:46,319
these hormones and see a reduction in

655
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:50,720
cannabinoids

656
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:54,000
um and well THC if you're a hemp grower

657
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,400
maybe CB like maybe if you're trying to

658
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,960
create a strain that just has more

659
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:04,080
cannabinoid like CBG dominant strains

660
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,259
um but also there's another part of my

661
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:10,199
research that was really interesting

662
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,819
um in the promoter I was of this prenal

663
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,519
transferase Gene that made enzyme that

664
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:16,379
makes CBG I was actually able to mutate

665
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,599
part of it

666
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,840
um which then gets into the GMO stuff

667
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,819
and I know it's controversial but um

668
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,619
so I actually mutated the part of it

669
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:28,918
when we were doing like

670
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:31,859
um like petri dish stuff uh so I got rid

671
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,980
of the responsive element to salicylic

672
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:38,459
acid and then we saw no response to it

673
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,019
so if you can mutate these promoters and

674
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,579
then put them back in the plant which

675
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:43,980
they're not able to do yet they're

676
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:47,099
working on actually

677
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,720
um like genetically modifying uh the

678
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,639
cannabis plants

679
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,100
um whenever they're able to actually do

680
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,440
that you can take the gene

681
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:59,158
mutate it put it back in then it's no

682
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,019
longer responsive to this hormone and

683
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,159
then there's also other parts of the

684
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:04,500
promoters

685
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,960
that are responsive to other things like

686
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,359
these genes that'll bind and activate it

687
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,579
called transcription factors and so you

688
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,319
can also mutate those areas and so they

689
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:16,079
won't bind anymore and so they won't

690
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,939
activate G so

691
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,359
um all of these different methods you

692
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,919
can come up with Gene editing

693
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,139
um giving them different types of

694
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,400
hormones you can determine if the

695
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,640
plant's going to make make more or less

696
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,038
THC and as I said this is really

697
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,000
um making less THC is good for the hemp

698
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:35,879
Growers

699
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,119
making more THC is great for these

700
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,860
medical marijuana cultivations

701
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,239
so there's a lot of different things we

702
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:45,899
can do

703
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,058
um and yeah figuring out which enzymes

704
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,340
work to make which cannabinoids is

705
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:51,960
really important so then that's just the

706
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:54,778
Baseline you can go in so many different

707
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,340
directions from that right you know and

708
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:58,019
I know we talked about you know Gene

709
00:28:56,339 --> 00:29:00,658
editing and how that's you know

710
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:03,058
controversial in a lot of ways too but I

711
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,559
think also you know some work that we're

712
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:06,000
kind of doing on the medicinal genomic

713
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,639
side with you know helping Growers

714
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,700
sequence their plants and maybe find you

715
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,919
know interesting novel mutations and

716
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,240
things like that I think that and you

717
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,480
correct me if I'm wrong if we understand

718
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,000
which parts of the gene or which genes

719
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,980
are implicated for for these things we

720
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,740
might be able to find naturally

721
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,480
occurring mutations in some of these

722
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,579
plants and then you know to kind of use

723
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,339
more traditional breeding or marker

724
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:35,220
assisted breeding to sort of get the end

725
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:39,778
result that we're looking for right yeah

726
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:42,240
I think developing the like the full

727
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,940
understanding of all the gene networks

728
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,759
and which genes do what is the best step

729
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,980
to start with and then like actually I

730
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,319
know there have been people breeding

731
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,319
some plants to like get rid of a thca

732
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,240
synthase Gene naturally and so that's

733
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,439
totally that's like that's I think

734
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,679
that's one of the best ways to go about

735
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,778
it and I know the plants can still make

736
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,759
some thca even if they don't have the

737
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:08,220
THC synthase Gene because the synthase

738
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,419
genes are very similar

739
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,058
um so you wouldn't get rid of all the

740
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,559
thci but in that case like you're still

741
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:15,240
working to get rid of some things that

742
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,359
you don't want you can add in different

743
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,159
things so I think breeding and like just

744
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,319
understanding the plants is one of the

745
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,480
best ways to go about all this cannabis

746
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,298
science

747
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,579
excellent all right Lauren so winding

748
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:33,658
down here um I did want to give you an

749
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:36,658
opportunity to uh plug any social media

750
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,340
or any you know websites or anything uh

751
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,960
that you're affiliated with or you're

752
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:42,778
posting your work about

753
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,519
um or just any other resources that you

754
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:46,200
know about that are sort of in a similar

755
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,319
vein to this that would be good for for

756
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,538
folks to read up on um please let us

757
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:54,778
know yeah so

758
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:57,058
um I just finished my masters at Uconn

759
00:30:54,778 --> 00:31:00,058
and they have one of the best plant

760
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:02,879
science programs ever I had the best lab

761
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:05,038
with Dr Jerry Berkowitz and a few others

762
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,140
so I want to just say thank you to them

763
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,759
and go check out our research we've been

764
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,159
coming up with a lot of new cannabis

765
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,319
research we have one right in the works

766
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,080
this paper actually it's the pre-print

767
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:19,259
is posted we are currently actually

768
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:22,439
publishing it so it should be out soon

769
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:24,419
um I just want to also shout out to my

770
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,538
lab that I work at in Westfield

771
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:29,700
Massachusetts it's called safetyva Labs

772
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:32,879
we're a startup we've probably been open

773
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,940
for like two months now and we are one

774
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,539
of the best teams I've ever met

775
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,159
um

776
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:43,140
that we do all sorts of testing we do

777
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,299
um really competitive turnaround times

778
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,820
for anybody in the area that wants to

779
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:49,679
test with us we do pickups

780
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,259
um so yeah safety in the labs check us

781
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,059
out on Instagram

782
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:56,339
LinkedIn online

783
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:59,700
and yeah that's about it thanks to my

784
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:01,678
lab and UConn lab and of course thanks

785
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,120
to my family and friends

786
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,159
yeah excellent I will definitely put

787
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,079
links to the the social media and the

788
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,080
websites in the show notes so people can

789
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,460
find it quick and yeah I um I Echo your

790
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:12,720
sentiments about the work that's coming

791
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,880
out of Uconn

792
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,919
um I think we've had a a number of

793
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,260
submissions from folks out of that lab

794
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,059
and uh I expect that UConn's gonna be

795
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:23,640
well represented at cam mid 23 which

796
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:25,740
we're really absolutely yes me too

797
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,200
so all right so thanks again Lauren for

798
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,720
doing this and I look forward to seeing

799
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,899
you out at Marco Island thank you you as

800
