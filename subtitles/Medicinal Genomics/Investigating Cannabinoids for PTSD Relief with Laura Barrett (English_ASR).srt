participate and how data will be

85
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,920
good morning Laura thank you so much for

86
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,318
joining me on the

87
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,439
podcast uh thank you for having me I'm

88
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,279
excited to be here I'm excited to talk

89
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,719
with you today about a study that you're

90
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,279
doing to better understand how cannabis

91
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,560
can be used to treat PTSD um oddly

92
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,319
enough I did a quick search of our Ked

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,680
archive on the website site where we

94
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,478
have all the recordings of all the

95
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,959
different canid presentations over the

96
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:40,000
years and I was surprised I didn't find

97
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,359
one about PTSD I would think that over

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,759
the years that we've been doing this

99
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,439
that there would be one but that's not

100
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:49,160
the case um but maybe that'll change in

101
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:52,639
20125 our abstract portal is open by the

102
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,759
way um till November 15 so if you or

103
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,918
anyone else who's studying PTSD would

104
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,919
like to submit one um that would be

105
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:02,519
great to see but anyway back to back to

106
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,079
why you're here I was wondering if you

107
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,079
could provide an overview of the study

108
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:11,399
kind of what are the primary objectives

109
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:14,359
and what got you interested in exploring

110
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:17,038
PTSD uh yes so thank you for asking it's

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,400
such an important question and I just

112
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,199
want to say that so many people I I

113
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:26,038
believe have symptoms of

114
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,400
PTSD and they don't even know what PTSD

115
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,079
is like they don't a lot of people don't

116
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,239
attribute what they're feeling to this

117
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,959
post-traumatic stress disorder and so

118
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,560
often I think it's kind of like

119
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:43,599
depression we overutilize the term PTSD

120
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,720
oh it's PTSD or it's bipolar or oh it's

121
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,919
depression OCD right like is it

122
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,800
officially diagnosed even impostor

123
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,918
syndrome I find myself I I I just

124
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,199
responded to a friend on LinkedIn and I

125
00:05:53,918 --> 00:06:00,198
said impostor like symptoms rather than

126
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:04,360
saying impostor syndrome I think PTS is

127
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:06,680
the same way and so when we so this is

128
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,240
not just me this is a nonprofit called

129
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,720
the Connor Sheffield Foundation based

130
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,598
out of Baltimore County in

131
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,599
Maryland and uh we came together a

132
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:20,839
couple years ago established the

133
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:24,319
foundation because of the person Conor

134
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,598
Sheffield and and his need as a a young

135
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,439
person for cannabis and cannaboid

136
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:30,519
medicine because it's the only thing

137
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,918
that helped him thrive like he was a

138
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:36,120
failure to thrive couldn't gain weight

139
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:39,478
pediatric stomach motility disorder very

140
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,120
rare and and the only thing that worked

141
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,758
were cannabinoids at first mostly uh

142
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,759
some you know cannabal but eventually

143
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:51,120
even some THC and and now he's you know

144
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,360
in his early 20s and thriving and still

145
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,240
really relies on on cannabis medicine

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,240
and so the family and then a bunch of

147
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,918
volunteers came together to establish

148
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,560
this Foundation to raise money to do

149
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,399
research on cannabinoids because we

150
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,598
don't have a lot of it and It's Tricky

151
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,198
um as many of uh my peers in in cannabis

152
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,079
Therapeutics and cannabis medicine and

153
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,879
you guys have spoken about it's really

154
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:20,279
tricky to do research yeah so at first

155
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,360
we were really hoping that my friends at

156
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,839
Hopkins would do a research project with

157
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,120
us and and I think eventually we will do

158
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,159
some collaboration with them at some at

159
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,959
some point but um it's so so time

160
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,960
consuming to get an academic research

161
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,239
project and with the the scheduling of

162
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,439
of cannabis at this time is really

163
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,000
challenging so we went through an

164
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:46,240
independent um you know with an IRB

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,439
process since it's on people and um came

166
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,240
up with just doing a smaller study first

167
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,680
an observational study so this is not a

168
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,240
controlled trial we are not providing

169
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,879
the medicine we are just um asking

170
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,840
people that have symptoms or diagnosis

171
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,800
so you don't actually have to have had a

172
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,198
doctor say you have post-traumatic

173
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,400
stress disorder you have to have

174
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,800
symptoms of post-traumatic stress which

175
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:19,918
could be fear anxiety uh

176
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,840
sleeplessness um outbursts triggers to a

177
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,439
an experience that brings you back to

178
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,399
Vivid memories of something that

179
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:30,399
happened in the past and for some people

180
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,120
which I I think we don't talk about this

181
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,639
enough uh but again the person that our

182
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,759
organization is founded off of um

183
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:42,799
struggles with this um some people have

184
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:46,639
medical post-traumatic stress disorder

185
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,000
like having had a medical crisis and and

186
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,639
and struggling with it you know like if

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,200
you had a heart attack or if you had a

188
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,958
stroke and you were covered the

189
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,879
challenge of not being afraid that

190
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:01,319
that's going to happen again because in

191
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:04,120
some cases it may right right um so um

192
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,360
there are people who are even challenged

193
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,600
just by getting their checkups going to

194
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,680
the doctor you know uh waiting for that

195
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,720
lab result waiting for that next

196
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,559
mamogram result and so a lot of people

197
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,959
have

198
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,679
symptoms of this post-traumatic stress

199
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,479
disorder and so we want to include

200
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,078
anyone that has symptoms like that

201
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,759
diagnosed or

202
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:31,639
undiagnosed that is considering or has

203
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:34,078
been using uh aboid medicine purchased

204
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:36,879
from a legal dispensary so once again

205
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:40,479
they do not have to be in a state where

206
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,360
they have um an adult use program or

207
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,560
necessarily a medical program they just

208
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,639
have to have legally licensed

209
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,799
dispensaries because we want it to have

210
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,720
a label and and hopefully be lab tested

211
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,439
which honestly not every state even

212
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,519
requires all of the lab testing but we

213
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,839
like a label we we we'd like it to be

214
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,120
purchased

215
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,160
legally uh so um and and just

216
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,360
observational data so we are doing three

217
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,078
surveys and mostly yes or no questions

218
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,240
we are not expecting to take a lot of

219
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:17,278
time um out of someone's life out of

220
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:22,278
their day 30 days 60 days and six months

221
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:25,039
30 days 90 days and six months um and

222
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:28,039
it's just a I think about 20 question

223
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,879
survey mostly yes or no questions and

224
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:33,480
we're trying to

225
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,919
establish which cannaboids are people

226
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,600
using because there are a couple there

227
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,759
there isn't a lot of research I mean we

228
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,600
know it's challenging with research but

229
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:46,078
this is such a varied diagnosis or

230
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,959
varied amount of symptoms so a lot of

231
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:52,799
times we're looking at fear and anxiety

232
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:55,679
and and how that's related and treating

233
00:10:52,799 --> 00:11:00,199
that symptom and how does that help

234
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:03,399
relate to um resolving or or dealing

235
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,959
with the post-traumatic stress disorder

236
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,639
symptoms

237
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:12,239
but should I just keep going yeah yeah

238
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:15,399
yeah I have so there is I want to give

239
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,320
credit to a a more recent study out of

240
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,799
Wayne State University in Detroit

241
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,480
Michigan I want to give these these

242
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:24,559
folks some credit they did uh cannaboid

243
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,159
modulation of brain activation during

244
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,479
FAL regulation of netive negative affect

245
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,240
in trauma exposed adult so essentially

246
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,079
they were looking to see if they gave

247
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,039
some cannabis and they gave you a

248
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:39,039
trigger how did you respond if you we

249
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,679
knew you had a history of

250
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:45,159
trauma and and it's um it it's really

251
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,439
good information I mean what they meant

252
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:50,919
essentially we're looking at is this

253
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,680
emotional disregulation because that is

254
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,319
the the one of the main things that

255
00:11:53,679 --> 00:12:00,838
happens with post-traumatic stress

256
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:03,720
disorder is you the person you uh has

257
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,079
trouble recovering like it's not like

258
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,399
some people like you could see a bear

259
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,799
and think ooh do I run do I freeze what

260
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,799
am I supposed to do and then think about

261
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,439
it and move on hopefully get away from

262
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:19,039
the bear but someone that is has post-

263
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,040
trumatic stress disorder can't like

264
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:25,120
loses their ability to function and and

265
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:27,958
would go to an extreme of extreme fear

266
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,839
or extreme uh physical reaction or

267
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,399
extreme

268
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,279
uh depression like something that that

269
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,078
then takes days you know tookes a lot of

270
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:41,159
time to to move out of and so so they

271
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,559
they looked at this and they they did

272
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,838
find that as we might expect and

273
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:50,198
anticipate and I've seen in some of my

274
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:54,680
patients that when people use it really

275
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:57,679
is the the THC not so much um C CBD a

276
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:01,120
little bit but really the THC uh really

277
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,120
does seem to help people

278
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,639
um work through uh therapy like

279
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,479
cognitive behavioral therapy work

280
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,000
through it um

281
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,759
better

282
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,720
than than not not having it and and so

283
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:18,159
in their study they they used um you

284
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,680
know they did both because this actually

285
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,919
was like a trial so they have patients

286
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:25,638
who uh were using cannabis and patients

287
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:29,319
who weren't and and they found that it

288
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:31,839
did increase the C cerebella activation

289
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,600
uh when they saw these images and they

290
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,880
they had less negative side effects so

291
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,720
um it it's a great little study I I'll

292
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,919
share the link so that people can yeah

293
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,680
absolutely it but I was I was pleased to

294
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:49,078
see that and our goal really is just to

295
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:52,479
have a better idea of which routes of

296
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:55,319
administration people are using and and

297
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,600
which ratio of cannabis if they're using

298
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,440
a ratio or not so in in some of the few

299
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,320
studies maybe in the past couple of

300
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:07,279
years where they have looked at cannabis

301
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:11,560
uh THC in particular they've been um if

302
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:14,799
it's been oral either synthetic or um

303
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:17,559
you know in a natural form it's been a

304
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,958
lowish dose between 5 to 10 milligrams

305
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:23,599
7.5 milligrams seems to be that The

306
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:25,638
Sweet Spot and also it's been like a lot

307
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,360
of inhaled cannabis which is really hard

308
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,600
to measure and especially as a nurse

309
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,039
like my goal isn't for people to to need

310
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,360
to just smoke all day you know that's

311
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:40,719
not really the goal we'd like to be able

312
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:44,000
to to find some some baseline like oh if

313
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,360
you take a a 4 to one tablet so four

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,919
times the THC to onetime CBD uh in this

315
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,959
low dose uh twice a day like maybe it'll

316
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,559
keep your symptoms at Bay so that you

317
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,439
could be functional at work and

318
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,078
functional taking care of your grandkids

319
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,440
and functional

320
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,559
just to to feel good in your life and

321
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,199
and potentially to use some of these

322
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:11,958
cannabinoids to do the uh n the the

323
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,599
regular more

324
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:17,479
traditional psychological therapy like

325
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,159
cognitive behavioral therapy to

326
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,399
potentially heal from recover from some

327
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,439
of these

328
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,600
issues I have some amazing uh veteran

329
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,199
patients you know because that's a big

330
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,319
population that is known to uh suffer

331
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:37,240
from post-traumatic stress disorder and

332
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:39,919
uh using some

333
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,240
THC again in in the right amount once we

334
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,759
kind of figure out what that right

335
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,799
amount is I have had stories from

336
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,399
patients who weren't able to sleep in

337
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:54,479
bed at night with their spouse because

338
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,159
of nightmares and outbursts and a fear

339
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,680
of injuring their spouse in the middle

340
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:01,198
of the night or or just scaring them

341
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:07,198
even from you

342
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:09,318
know yelling and um we have been able to

343
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,958
again not medical advice but with

344
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:14,599
encouragement and education uh have some

345
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,719
of these people I mean some amazing

346
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,639
Stories like I can sleep in bed with my

347
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,839
spouse now I used to have to sleep in

348
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,120
another room sometimes even with a

349
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,519
locked door I mean I've heard some

350
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:30,519
really extreme situations and um that

351
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,919
sleep piece and and pressing the the REM

352
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,440
sleep which is the dream sleep which is

353
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:37,159
a lot of times where the nightmares

354
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:41,040
occur uh seems to be really beneficial

355
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:43,719
so I I I have so many peers that are

356
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,519
more experts than I am in some of these

357
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,800
individual Fields uh but as a nurse just

358
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,318
trying to bring that holistic picture

359
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,879
together the whole person and looking at

360
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:56,240
how do we make them the most productive

361
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:59,639
in the daytime the best rested at night

362
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,959
uh to be uh the their best version of

363
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,399
themselves is is really the goal so

364
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,958
that's really interesting so you

365
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,959
mentioned that the THC is helpful

366
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,120
because it sort of suppresses the REM

367
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,558
sleep or so it's actually kind of

368
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,279
blocking them from getting uh into REM

369
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:18,918
sleep and having those dreams that can

370
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,519
trigger the the trauma yes that's my

371
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,520
understanding and and I think it's

372
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,959
really beautiful and there was a short

373
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:28,000
time which I needed to rely on some of

374
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,519
my expert peers uh which you know we

375
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,279
always have more to learn and we need

376
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:35,879
more research there was a short time

377
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:39,279
where I was concerned that uh so

378
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,039
many patients people consumers users

379
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:45,038
were using THC for sleep and maybe not

380
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:47,720
getting enough quality sleep right of

381
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:50,879
that but we have to look at each

382
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,200
individual person and look at if you

383
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,000
sleep well if you're not using cannabis

384
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,200
at nighttime and you sleep well my

385
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,200
recommendation education is don't start

386
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,558
like why why would you do that right if

387
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,440
you don't need to why would you do

388
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:08,279
that however many people use things like

389
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,720
alcohol because they think alcohol helps

390
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,319
them fall asleep and maybe it does help

391
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
them fall asleep but it really doesn't

392
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,839
give us quality sleep at all we know

393
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,960
that for a fact so for many people

394
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:23,319
cannabis can give them THC in particular

395
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,759
can give them better sleep than the

396
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,119
sleep that they are

397
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,640
getting right have to just look at those

398
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,599
individual things and figure out maybe

399
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,880
it is inhaled cannabis just a few hours

400
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:37,439
before bed that helps them fall asleep

401
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,159
if falling asleep is their issue or or

402
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,200
maybe it is some type of edible capsule

403
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:46,520
something that's going to last longer in

404
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,360
in uh even some cases uh an extracted

405
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,798
oil like RSO uh that will give them a

406
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,199
longer to help them stay asleep

407
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,918
specifically if they have pain or

408
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,798
post-traumatic stress disorder

409
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,280
nightmares other things maybe even uh

410
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,158
women's issues like menopausal symptoms

411
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,200
hot flashes might be helpful and I know

412
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,440
this whole episode isn't to talk about

413
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,759
sleep and cannabis however

414
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,759
post-traumatic stress disorder a lot of

415
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,519
people experience those symptoms during

416
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:17,359
the night that's a big part some people

417
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,798
have it just trying to fall asleep when

418
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,479
all of a sudden all the noise of the

419
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,519
world gets quiet and then suddenly all

420
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,679
the anxiety and fear and the racing

421
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:30,119
thoughts come in and the Cannabis THC in

422
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:34,200
particular helps to break those racing

423
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:37,079
thoughts stop that that in your head so

424
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,840
um it can be really beneficial and so

425
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:42,439
we're looking to

426
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:45,399
gather our minimum is 300 people I keep

427
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,759
telling everybody I want a thousand so

428
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,240
we really have no limitation it it's

429
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,879
very short amount of time yes or no

430
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,000
questions only three

431
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,960
surveys and I just hope that people will

432
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,919
consider it's all through uh the

433
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,679
tetragram app which which if if your

434
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,679
viewers if our viewers don't already

435
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:09,120
know um I want to give a plug to

436
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:13,080
tetragram the app uh because it's a

437
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:15,239
beautiful free app that consumers can

438
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,480
use where you can track like Journal

439
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,720
your cannabis uh medicine you can in

440
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,759
some cases scan the barcode on the

441
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,038
product and have all the data pull in

442
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,640
for you uh Physicians and and providers

443
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:32,000
can have group group of patients and

444
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,240
kind of share information and track

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,480
through groups like different types of

446
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,679
patients it it's really beneficial so

447
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,200
we're using that app to collect the data

448
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,798
so it's like on your phone or on your

449
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,919
iPad or computer really quick for

450
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:50,038
somebody to do and the more people we

451
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,559
have the more we'll be able to you know

452
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:56,519
have a better analysis of of what does

453
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:59,399
seem to work best for most people you

454
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:02,519
just have to be over 21 and purchasing

455
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,759
again from a legal

456
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,639
dispensary yeah and so so you mentioned

457
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,000
using the app and being able to journal

458
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,000
and and track your usage and everything

459
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,400
so I know that you also mentioned

460
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,960
there's sort of three different surveys

461
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,200
at different time points but are you

462
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,319
also kind of collecting data kind of in

463
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,640
between those points as well if people

464
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,480
are are journaling and and tracking

465
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,919
things in the app yes so in the app

466
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,558
anytime anyone logs anything like that

467
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,759
data will be there and they they have

468
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:31,839
the option you know in or opt out of

469
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,400
certain things right we we don't we want

470
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:37,918
to make sure that we keep privacy but we

471
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,080
we do we have lots of um points uh in

472
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,520
app that we can collect even as simple

473
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:45,278
as like age which is important it's good

474
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,839
to know you know is are these younger

475
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:50,000
people dealing with this are they older

476
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,839
people and the specific symptoms so you

477
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,038
have the option to say I'm using

478
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,558
cannabis to manage PTSD symptoms but

479
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,919
then more specifically which symptoms

480
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:02,599
are you having right because again some

481
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,960
people have more Outburst some people

482
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:07,918
have more um social anxiety disorder

483
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,600
like it just it just depends some people

484
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,840
have insomnia and they're not sleeping

485
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:15,959
because of it uh so so that's a part of

486
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:18,399
it you know is it preventing you from

487
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,038
working like those

488
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,278
things and then we also can even track

489
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,960
like by the state so we can see you know

490
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:28,119
which states and which products people

491
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,159
are using in which states uh to give us

492
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:33,599
an idea aide of where we need to

493
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,320
encourage more development of newer um

494
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:39,079
processed products because again in in

495
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,079
some cases people are inhaling and that

496
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:43,558
way they just have access to flour and

497
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:46,678
strains which can be great and they can

498
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:47,839
track in the app like different tpes and

499
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,798
the

500
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:54,038
ratios and then we also need to look at

501
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:57,319
is it is it better in a more edible form

502
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:59,119
or is it is anyone using a topical does

503
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:02,079
a does a topical

504
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,918
help someone that is being triggered

505
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,759
like if they put a topical rub on their

506
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:11,759
neck you know or or do a little bit of

507
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:13,919
self massage uh to to release and do

508
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,480
some breathing does that relieve their

509
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,640
symptoms I mean it could all the

510
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,120
different ways that you could support

511
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,759
your end endoc canabo system could help

512
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,599
so it's just interesting it'll be

513
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:28,759
interesting to see that that data we

514
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,119
just need people to sign up

515
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,278
yeah we'll put a link right in the show

516
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,439
description so people can easily get to

517
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:36,919
it and either participate or share it

518
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,360
with someone who uh they know that

519
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:42,600
they're a good fit for it so yeah I I

520
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,479
was curious how are people using

521
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,519
cannabis kind of to treat their symptoms

522
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,480
is it sort of like a a preventative

523
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:51,839
thing or like a a kind of

524
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,880
daily um usage just to kind of keep

525
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,839
symptoms at Bay or do they actually use

526
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,278
it um in an acute situation where like

527
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:01,798
you said having a panic attack or having

528
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,240
an episode ingesting cannabis to kind of

529
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:08,119
get back to Baseline that's a really

530
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,159
great question so first of all for the

531
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:13,359
the research study we just started

532
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,799
collecting patients in October so we're

533
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,599
we're still in the data collection um or

534
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,038
well Ian we don't even have any data yet

535
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:23,240
we we're still in the patient

536
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:25,319
recruitment part of of that study um and

537
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,880
then once we get all the patients and we

538
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:31,359
sort of close off which I think we're

539
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,278
doing January 1st then we're going to do

540
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:38,719
um we have that like six months is the

541
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:42,839
survey so so there's that uh but in my

542
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,079
practice so I am um independent I work

543
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,038
as a consultant I'm a registered nurse

544
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:50,879
and I I coach people and work with

545
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:54,158
people alongside of their doctor

546
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,240
um as a bridge my my favorite thing to

547
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,679
say about nursing and cannabis is well

548
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,679
holistic and plant medicine overall is

549
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,519
is we are the bridge we're the bridge

550
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,880
between the provider and the dispensary

551
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:09,119
for the patient we're the bridge between

552
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,278
like uh traditional medicine and then

553
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,879
holistic and integrative medicine I'm

554
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:17,558
writing a book nurses are the bridge

555
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:22,360
coming soon hopefully by Puerto Rico uh

556
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:26,879
so as that nurse coach nurse educator in

557
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:30,079
in my practice with patients I have

558
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,960
many people that that have um suffered

559
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:36,199
from like sexual

560
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:40,840
trauma domestic violence and

561
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:44,960
uh many of them are women and many of

562
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:50,639
them have like an overwhelming sense of

563
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:54,558
Doom every day and there really

564
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,278
aren't a good group of or a good

565
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,798
protocol for prescription medications

566
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:03,079
I'm I'm a medicine nurse but I'm very

567
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:05,278
much also for integrating traditional

568
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,720
Pharmaceuticals we just don't have a lot

569
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,640
of traditional

570
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,440
Pharmaceuticals that that work or that

571
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,679
you have to take so many or the side

572
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,600
effects are so much that that can

573
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:21,399
relieve the symptoms so I have people

574
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:26,038
getting back to your question that take

575
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:29,398
a a a low dose of just something

576
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:31,599
routinely which we have some pretty good

577
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:35,439
uh data and some of our our friends that

578
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:38,119
are very involved with uh canmed and

579
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,278
medicinal genomics would share that you

580
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:45,038
know one to one equal amounts of CBD and

581
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:48,200
THC have have been known in low doses to

582
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:51,200
be helpful for anxiety and so I do have

583
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,679
some people that that utilize those

584
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,558
types of routes of administration we're

585
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,240
getting more data more research recently

586
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,798
about another canono CB G being really

587
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,200
helpful also for

588
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:08,519
anxiety but to your point depending on

589
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,720
when their symptoms are worse generally

590
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,398
so if it's not that they just wake up

591
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,798
every day with that impending doom and

592
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:18,439
need something if it is more about being

593
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:20,200
in the world and being triggered like

594
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,880
potentially somebody that was in a

595
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,480
traumatic car accident uh might have

596
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,960
anxiety just every time they have to get

597
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,038
in the car and drive and

598
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,640
I'm not going to encourage people to

599
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,640
smoke a little bit before they get in

600
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,840
the car and drive we have to be

601
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,759
thoughtful right so in though that case

602
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,798
we definitely would be considering a

603
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,480
less

604
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:46,519
intoxicating um route uh less cannaboid

605
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,079
and and less intoxicating route we want

606
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,839
people to be safe on the road but if it

607
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,119
is that they're going to be uh home or

608
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,879
they're in an environment where they're

609
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,719
not the driver uh then potentially if

610
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,640
they are triggered how having an

611
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:06,079
inhalation option available whether that

612
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:09,440
is uh in inhaling like a lot of times

613
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,158
honestly I tell people with um

614
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,558
post-traumatic stress disorder and like

615
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,440
panic attacks related to it to consider

616
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:20,119
carrying a vape pen like like it's an

617
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,360
epip pen so so have it on you you don't

618
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:25,278
have again in a legal state where you

619
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:27,839
legally can use it have it there just

620
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,240
just knowing you have it might help you

621
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,398
you might not even need to use it but

622
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,839
it's easier and more accessible than

623
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:38,599
having to actually light something and

624
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,558
smoke it in environments where with the

625
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,319
state of our country we would still not

626
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,319
be be able to do that

627
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:47,839
everywhere but I have had experience

628
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:51,278
with multiple uh patients where just

629
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:53,359
having it in their purse on their person

630
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:57,440
just knowing they have it has been

631
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:58,558
enough for their brain to release the

632
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,558
sympathetic

633
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:06,720
nervous system get back to um a more

634
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:10,000
natural response um and and feel feel

635
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:14,240
better and or they can take a puff or

636
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,319
two and immediately have some relief so

637
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,038
I I think it can be used and I'm

638
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:22,519
interested to see the the survey uh

639
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:26,519
responses because I think it can be used

640
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:29,558
for like the in the moment but we would

641
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,558
be looking my my goal for PE most people

642
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:34,398
is hopefully to prevent having to even

643
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,398
get to that having to prevent those

644
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,158
feelings because when our body is

645
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,359
releasing all that cortisol and going

646
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,880
through that that triggered response uh

647
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,558
it's it's unhealthy for us it doesn't

648
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,480
feel good I mean I've had panic attacks

649
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,519
it doesn't feel good so I I would prefer

650
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,159
it if we could just keep the edge off

651
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:57,359
that and utilize the tools of cannabis

652
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:00,278
medicine plant medicine and maybe

653
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:04,599
entheogenic medicine some psychedelics

654
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:07,640
to to do the work do the therapy retrain

655
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:10,359
our brain to to learn a new

656
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,360
response yeah excellent another thing I

657
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:17,319
wanted to ask you about is is dosage and

658
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:19,918
probably kind of a corollary to that as

659
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:22,398
well would be sort of the the ratio of

660
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,640
the canono too I'm just speaking from

661
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:24,918
personal experience one of the things

662
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,038
that you talked about was sort of like

663
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,559
trying to sleep having racing thoughts

664
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:32,839
and things like that I've actually had

665
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:35,240
issues with that if I have too much THC

666
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:36,639
or if it's not the right strain for me I

667
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,919
can't fall asleep because I have those

668
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,840
racing thoughts and can't stop them so I

669
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,600
imagine with someone who struggles with

670
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:46,480
that uh with

671
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:48,278
PTSD finding the right ratio at the

672
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,038
right dosage is is

673
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:53,798
critical yes it's really important and

674
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:57,200
and that's why you know it's so

675
00:30:53,798 --> 00:31:00,240
interesting to think about how many of

676
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,038
the dispensaries across the country sell

677
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,759
gummies that are 10 milligrams as like

678
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:09,119
the the starting dose 10 milligrams of

679
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,960
THC starting dose anybody walks in we

680
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,959
have all of these

681
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,600
seniors I think they like to be called

682
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:22,359
something else

683
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:24,759
now wise people over 65 who who you know

684
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:27,199
they smoked in college or they smoked

685
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:29,119
way back when and then now we have it

686
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,960
legal so they go to a dispensary and

687
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,599
they're like yeah I want to take a gummy

688
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,200
to sleep my neighbor does it it sounds

689
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,759
fun and they get this 10 milligram gummy

690
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,798
and they take it and and maybe even they

691
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,879
take half to start because somebody

692
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:43,599
maybe told them that and then they feel

693
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,159
nothing an hour later so they take the

694
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,558
other half and then for many people

695
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,639
instead of falling

696
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,879
asleep they start to feel a little

697
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:55,558
paranoid or anxious or their heart's

698
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,559
racing and thankfully it's not going to

699
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:00,519
hurt them but once again it doesn't feel

700
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,278
good and my goal is to help people feel

701
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,919
good that's what I want to do and and I

702
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,278
think at the dispensaries that the the

703
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,799
people that are working at the counter

704
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,759
they want people to feel good too it's

705
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,879
just that they have um their endoc

706
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,798
canono system is primed they know

707
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,080
they're ready and they don't always

708
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,480
think about when someone says oh yeah

709
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,798
I've used cannabis before because

710
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,599
they're at the counter trying to be cool

711
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,200
and feeling intimidated by the young

712
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:32,038
person standing behind the counter and

713
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:35,880
the store self uh so generally I

714
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:39,879
recommend super low THC doses with

715
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:42,080
higher CBD at first uh and and I'm I'm

716
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,559
just not even getting into like all of

717
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,839
the cbda and CBG there are so many

718
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:50,079
cannaboids it's it's too much to just

719
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,879
try to give a quick but for the most

720
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,759
part

721
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,639
CBD canabidol is very available uh from

722
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:59,558
hemp and from Cannabis in our study you

723
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:04,038
have have to be purchasing from a

724
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:07,759
cannabis dispensary uh however um higher

725
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:11,558
CBD uh uh generally like 25 milligrams

726
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:13,038
and up uh with just a tiny bit maybe 2.5

727
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:16,158
milligrams of

728
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:18,240
THC and again I have to say this because

729
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,960
I have a nursing license I'm not a

730
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,079
doctor this is not medical

731
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,600
advice this is just education something

732
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:30,278
for you to consider and so um that can

733
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:33,839
be a good starting Place uh the the

734
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:37,359
canabal can really be helpful for um

735
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:40,079
relaxation and reducing anxiety we know

736
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:42,319
it's good for anxiety and inflammation

737
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,439
and there are some connections between

738
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:47,599
anxiety and inflammation interestingly

739
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,000
enough too uh which is why some of the

740
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,918
other cannabinoids and gut brain health

741
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,679
um are worth

742
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,759
considering but usually I'll encourage

743
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,360
people to start with that and and try

744
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:01,638
that for at least least four days but

745
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,879
potentially a couple weeks and just see

746
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:07,479
are we getting any benefit and then we

747
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:11,398
work our way up and yes some people end

748
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:14,639
up at 10 milligrams of THC and and maybe

749
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:18,078
if if you take lower doses can of a dial

750
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,320
is is B phasic meaning at one dose it

751
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,519
does one thing at another dose it does

752
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,159
another thing and so lower doses can

753
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,519
also like make you want to stay up and

754
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:30,280
read a book all night which it might not

755
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:33,358
feel feel anxious but you're also not

756
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,200
sleeping or make you too creative so

757
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:39,440
it's important to to understand some of

758
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:42,678
that Dynamic and just do a little bit of

759
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,878
um homework on that or talk to somebody

760
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:49,800
like me and uh but for some people they

761
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:53,159
might end up going towards mostly all

762
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,399
THC and and for people with a lot of

763
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:59,079
pain again it all depends on the person

764
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,759
and what what is keeping them awake if

765
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,079
it's racing thoughts that's one thing if

766
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,440
it's pain I mean some people do take a

767
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:08,440
40 milligram gummy which they sell in

768
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,119
some of the medical markets uh for

769
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,679
bedtime because they have that much pain

770
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,880
so they're taking that instead of taking

771
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:18,159
a bunch of opioids at bedtime and benzo

772
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,320
you know benzos and all these other

773
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,719
medications and and that keeps the pain

774
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,519
at Bay and also helps them sleep so it

775
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:28,159
it is a range it really is important to

776
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,759
to start

777
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:34,519
start low and go slow

778
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,079
y um and see how your body responds and

779
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:39,039
give your body time to respond yep

780
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,560
there's a reason we keep saying

781
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,159
that it's because it's true but I think

782
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:45,159
one of the things you mentioned before

783
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:47,960
about the value of the the study that

784
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:50,239
you're doing is to try to identify what

785
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,559
are those good ratios and make sure that

786
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,639
they're available to people in other

787
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,838
states because I know that's not the

788
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:01,039
case everywhere you they might not have

789
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:04,719
sort of that High CBD low THC ratio like

790
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:07,358
in some some states uh it's just all THC

791
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,719
you're lucky if you find any CBD so I

792
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,679
think that's that would be a great

793
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,598
benefit of of this work is to really

794
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:16,719
figure out what that good ratio is and

795
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,480
inform the the industry yes that's one

796
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,199
of the things I'm really grateful I

797
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,719
because I'm independent uh I don't I'm

798
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:27,279
not uh like full-time employed by

799
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:30,838
anybody just me ask nurse Laura and I I

800
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,839
love that I get to work uh because with

801
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:37,119
with nursing I can work in in other

802
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:40,559
states and talk to companies and talk to

803
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,559
uh researchers about about the different

804
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:46,039
products also in the hemp space and and

805
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:48,119
what what's out there that we're seeing

806
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:50,960
as beneficial and where are those gaps

807
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:53,960
what's missing and to educate people on

808
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,639
how to be a smart um hemp consumer even

809
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,199
like how to to find a reliable hemp

810
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,519
company um thankfully in our Network we

811
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,439
have some good people that have some

812
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:06,159
good products but there also is a lot of

813
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,200
garbage out there I did a secret shopper

814
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:12,358
campaign in the state of

815
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:14,960
Delaware and and for for hemp shops and

816
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:17,358
it was kind of scary what we found and

817
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,920
and it's a lot because it's not so

818
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,960
regulated

819
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,159
um so I just want to encourage people to

820
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,039
do their homework and and uh learn how

821
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:32,358
to dig into the details not just trust

822
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,358
you know like Google reviews and and not

823
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:35,838
just trust a handshake you know we need

824
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:37,920
to know what we're getting what we're

825
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,639
putting in our body because even if

826
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,440
today it doesn't cause a negative effect

827
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,920
uh some of the the things that might be

828
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,960
in some of these products might cause

829
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,079
issues down the road that we don't even

830
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,440
know about yeah no that could be a whole

831
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,960
that could be a whole other podcast and

832
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,880
actually I think we should do that uh I

833
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,000
think it's really interesting and um it

834
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,640
was one of the things I was going to ask

835
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,159
but then I remembered that you know that

836
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:04,239
the study is restricted to getting

837
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,000
products from a dispensary because I was

838
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,078
curious you know are people using hemp

839
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,239
diive cannabinoids or sort of these

840
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:14,839
synthetic cannabinoids like delta8 THC

841
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:17,199
or some of these other things for ptst I

842
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:18,159
think that would be interesting uh maybe

843
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:22,078
a later

844
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:23,318
study yes yes we we you know well maybe

845
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,000
you don't know but when you're trying to

846
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:28,159
get approved by an

847
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,318
IRB it it is an independent review board

848
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,318
it it's a lot of work and there are a

849
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:34,318
lot of specifics that you have to follow

850
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:36,759
and and we're trying to do everything

851
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:39,800
like this is our first study we hope to

852
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,200
do so many more research projects uh but

853
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,039
you have to do something to get off the

854
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,879
ground and so we had to find ways to

855
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:49,480
sort of level the playing field just a

856
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:52,160
little bit sure and we do have

857
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,599
um regulations so there's a a group

858
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,719
called uh canra the Cannabis Regulators

859
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,760
Association that brings together

860
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,759
cannabis Reg Regulators from multiple

861
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,200
States uh and and they talk and and

862
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,599
hopefully at some point we're going to

863
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,559
have some more standard across the

864
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,760
country that's one of the challenges

865
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:12,838
that that I find is is standards from

866
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,839
state to state accessibility from state

867
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:19,400
to state it it really is challenging and

868
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:21,960
uh to to take the time to figure out

869
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,358
what the regulations are like what what

870
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,358
are the standards in this state uh

871
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:28,920
especially for business owners so I have

872
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:31,799
a contract with Bright View Assisted

873
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Living because they want their uh

874
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,920
residents to be able to access cannabis

875
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,720
and utilize cannabis in their facilities

876
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,119
some of these people are this is the end

877
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,000
of their life is going to be in this

878
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,680
facility they want them to have a good

879
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,559
quality of life they operate in eight

880
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:50,799
states up and down the east coast and

881
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,279
even in the states they all have medical

882
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,200
programs but they have different rules

883
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,720
and different products in each of their

884
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:01,239
programs and trying to stand I a policy

885
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,439
and standardize implementation for them

886
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:06,479
it is really

887
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,880
challenging absolutely that's yeah we I

888
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,519
mean we deal with that medicinal

889
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,880
genomics you know making the testing

890
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:15,000
kits for all the different states and

891
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,640
trying to figure out what needs to be

892
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,280
tested in each of the different states

893
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,159
we have a tool on our website that tries

894
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,760
to make sense of it um but yeah it's

895
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:26,639
it's a full-time job I mean we have our

896
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,599
Regulatory Affairs team that's sort of

897
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,279
that's their job is to stay on top of

898
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:32,318
all the different changing regulations

899
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,839
and inform our R&amp;D about the different

900
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,920
tests it's yeah it's a hodg podge and I

901
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:39,719
think we're all dealing with it at at

902
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,800
different levels and we would love some

903
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,719
standardization it would really help us

904
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,480
yes and and it's interesting too because

905
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,719
it's in the cannaboids in the

906
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,800
dispensaries and also that the hemp is

907
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:56,639
just and again I'm a huge fan of hemp

908
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,960
derived canabo yeah just you have to

909
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,679
know the company

910
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,119
and really dig into where the hemp is

911
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,078
coming from how it's processed what it's

912
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,160
processed with who's testing it is it

913
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,560
really a third party is it really every

914
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:12,358
batch you know there's just

915
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:15,000
because at least shopping in a

916
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:17,279
dispensary depending on the state you

917
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,519
you know what the standards are that

918
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,040
they have to uphold and I'm lucky to

919
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,639
have started my journey in cannabis

920
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,559
healthc care and cannabis medicine in

921
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:29,719
Maryland that has some really strict

922
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,838
regulations around that um I actually

923
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:34,239
opened a grow facility and a processing

924
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,599
lab in three dispensaries when I first

925
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,519
came in about 10 years ago so I really

926
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:40,680
was like deep into the weeds like I was

927
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:43,679
the person with the lab coming to do our

928
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:46,039
samples and reading the reports so I I I

929
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,960
have some personal

930
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:50,079
experience and even that is kind of

931
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,800
interesting because if they're testing

932
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,560
it on day seven or day 10 of its curing

933
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,599
there are different results you know

934
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,880
absolutely or how much do we get to

935
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,640
reprocess and retest I mean it's it's

936
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:06,960
just it's a yeah that's a whole big

937
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:09,759
question and concern for health care

938
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,280
providers because I think that's part of

939
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,319
the reason that Physicians feel so

940
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,599
comfortable

941
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,199
prescribing prescriptions right for

942
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,640
giving out prescriptions because they

943
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:24,838
have gone through all these very

944
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:29,000
specific very regulated very precise

945
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:32,440
things to be replicated and with a plant

946
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,960
it's more challenging and with different

947
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,599
rules and regulations in every state

948
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,199
it's it's just much more challenging and

949
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:44,000
so we need nurses to be the

950
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,799
bridge absolutely absolutely we need you

951
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,639
need you to come to canmed and get

952
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,318
educated and meet some great people too

953
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:53,039
yeah all right um well Laura thanks so

954
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,719
much for doing this before I let you go

955
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,920
I just want to give you an opportunity

956
00:42:54,719 --> 00:43:00,279
to um either plug the study or other

957
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,599
resources that people can can view if

958
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,839
they're interested in learning more

959
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,079
about this and then um other ways that

960
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,199
they can get in contact with you and uh

961
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,359
learn about what you're doing thank you

962
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:12,358
so much yes I want to say I mentioned

963
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:15,119
the Connor Sheffield foundation and I'm

964
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:18,400
sure we'll put links for that in the the

965
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,800
show notes um it is not just me I don't

966

really hope that people will sign up for

979
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,160
our study we'll have a link we have a QR

980
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,599
code again it's not that difficult not

981
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,279
that timec consuming

982
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,480
I also have my independent practice

983
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,960
which is ask nurse Laura you can find me

984
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,599
on all social media at ask nurse Laura

985
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,000
and uh and then a group called The

986
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,760
National Clinical Director Consortium

987
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,280
which is a group of healthcare providers
