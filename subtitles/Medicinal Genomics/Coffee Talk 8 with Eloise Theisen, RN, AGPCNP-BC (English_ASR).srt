experience the instructors have to offer

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,320
when you consider that most medical

53
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:36,079

54
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,479

55

only way healthcare providers can learn

56
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,489

117
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:27,860
you as part of K and med 2020 and I know

118
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,410
you're gonna be quite busy out there

119
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,490
because you're wearing a lot of hats for

120
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,990
us this year which we definitely

121
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,970
appreciate you're a member of the

122
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,769
advisory board which is excellent you're

123
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,740
helping us weed through all the

124
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:40,819
abstracts and select the best speakers

125
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,740
you're going to be an oral presenter

126
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:45,139
again which we're very excited about and

127
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,110
they're also a big part of our medical

128
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:50,719
practicum which is going to be a great

129
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,730
addition to this year's event and I know

130
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,680
that you're you come from a nursing

131
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,939
background which i think is going to be

132
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,459
a really nice addition to to this year's

133
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:03,050
practicum or it's CMU event so we're

134
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:04,819
going to get to speak a bit more about

135
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,050
what that practicum is going to cover

136
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:11,449
and yeah yeah it's going to be a

137
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:15,020
jam-packed day I know we're planning on

138
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:18,829
doing about nine and a half hours worth

139
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:20,479
of content for those who attend and I'm

140
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,669
really excited that we're gonna be

141
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,920
covering you know Pediatrics to

142
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,980
geriatrics you know looking at chronic

143
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,990
pain looking at a panel for dosing kind

144
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,020
of talking about how we as clinicians

145
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,370
approach patients differently you know

146
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:37,279
so I think we're gonna have some really

147
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:41,030
exciting content that they won't find

148
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,859
during the regular can med present

149
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:43,879
presentation so we really did try to

150
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,220
make sure when we were looking at

151
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,709
abstracts that we had good diversity

152
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,220
among topics and stuff that people would

153
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:55,299
get excited about and if I'm not

154
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:58,070
mistaken that medical practicum will be

155
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,810
some continuing education nursing

156
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:02,420
credits will be available for that is

157
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,050
that true yeah so they had a hard time

158
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,819
getting continuing education credits for

159
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,650
physicians and pharmacists but I'm a

160
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:12,379
continuing education provider in

161
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:14,989
California so I'm able to offer nursing

162
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:17,329
continuing education credits for nurses

163
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,129
nurse practice nurse practitioners that

164
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:21,310
come in so I'm really excited about that

165
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:23,509
nine and a half hours worth of

166
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,360
continuing education credits towards

167
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:29,329
their license yeah that's great

168
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,139
and in advance of this call I did watch

169
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:32,598
your

170
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:34,968
can med 2019 presentation again which is

171
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:36,649
excellent I encourage everyone to go and

172
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:38,918
check that out on cam at events comm

173
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:41,859
I'll drop a link in the show description

174
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,810
and one thing that you mentioned is that

175
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,419
we need to get more nurses educated

176
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,788
about cannabis and more involved so I

177
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:52,609
know that you're president of the

178
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:54,079
American cannabis Nurses Association so

179
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,288
I was wonder if you could speak a bit

180
00:07:54,079 --> 00:08:00,079
about what you all do there absolutely

181
00:07:57,288 --> 00:08:02,329
so we're a national nursing organization

182
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,579
we're celebrating our 10th year this

183
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:07,250
year hard to believe um it was started

184
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:09,859
back in 2010 by Marilyn mathri and a few

185
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,468
others and we're now at about thirteen

186
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,169
hundred and fifty members we have a few

187
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:18,228
in Canada and Australia so we do have

188
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:20,508
some global presence as well and our

189
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:22,959
mission really is to improve nursing

190
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:26,180
excellence through education advocacy

191
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:29,329
research policy development so we've

192
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,788
been working really hard to you know get

193
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:33,379
more eyes on us because we really do

194
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,968
feel like nurses are going to help lead

195
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,879
the change you know we outnumber

196
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:40,278
physicians five to one we really are the

197
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,439
the boots on the ground the work force

198
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:45,889
in the medical community I think people

199
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,420
have seen that with kovat you know how

200
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:50,360
nurses have really been on the front

201
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:52,278
lines caring for these patients so I

202
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,310
think the more that we can get nurses

203
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:59,629
educated and the more that we can the

204
00:08:55,309 --> 00:09:01,069
more patients we can reach yeah one of

205
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,899
the things that stood out to me from

206
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,660
your presentation is you had mentioned

207
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:08,240
you were talking with dispensary owners

208
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:11,299
and they had said that it's not uncommon

209
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,019
for them to spend a half hour to an hour

210
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:17,179
with new patients mostly seniors who are

211
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,740
trying to kind of navigate their their

212
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:20,569
cannabis journey and try to figure out

213
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,698
what's good for them and I have to

214
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,500
imagine from a clinician perspective

215
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:27,169
that's got to be a little concerning

216
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,089
that these patients are kind of going to

217
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:31,429
the dispensary for this medical

218
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,260
education and as knowledgeable as they

219
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:36,799
certain as they are in most dispensaries

220
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:38,659
they're not clinicians no and I mean in

221
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,549
California it's very clear that you're

222
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:43,129
not to give any medical advice

223
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:45,529
however it's sort of this you know

224
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:47,659
it's this I don't know if I want to say

225
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,909
catch-22 but it's it's awkward because

226
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:51,889
most clinicians don't want to be

227
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:53,750
referred to as the pot doc or the pot

228
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:56,169
nurse so they're not necessarily

229
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,519
interested in getting into this field

230
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:01,370
they're still concerned the fact that

231
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,559
it's a Schedule one drug so often you

232
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,690
know the the dispensary staff are the

233
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:07,939
first ones to meet the patients and

234
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,470
they're there for them and I'm you know

235
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,870
as a clinician I'm grateful that they

236
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,210
have someone to work with I would like

237
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,799
to see an increase in scope you know

238
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,620
some standardization around scope of

239
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:21,469
practice some you know mandatory

240
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,679
training so that we can have you know at

241
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,649
least some consistency in you know how

242
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,089
we approach patients you know when

243
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:31,220
should they be referring them to a

244
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,810
clinician you know because it's there's

245
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,519
such a high turnover rate and the

246
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:36,979
dispensaries here in California that you

247
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:39,559
get a lot of myths and misconceptions

248
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,360
get repeated you know as a clinician

249
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,759
I've had my patients go to the

250
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,320
dispensary to pick up their cannabis and

251
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,289
then the dispensary staff will

252
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,240
contradict what I say so it can be

253
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:51,740
really confusing to the patient you know

254
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,100
they're already scared and overwhelmed

255
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:58,310
and intimidated and so if they go into

256
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,930
an environment that that they're you

257
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:02,029
know clinicians advice is being

258
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:03,649
contraindicated it really puts them in

259
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,139
an awkward position you know if well

260
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,340
what am I supposed to do and because

261
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:09,080
they can be really you know we can be

262
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:13,160
very passionate about cannabis we can be

263
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,480
very convincing sometimes from both ends

264
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,389
you know the dispensary staff in the

265
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,180
clinician so I just worry about seniors

266
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:22,069
who you know have a high risk of drug to

267
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,919
drug interactions or a high risk for

268
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:28,250
Falls potentially getting information

269
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:33,370
that could lead to an adverse event and

270
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:35,090
then they never use it again right and

271
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,009
one of the things that you had mentioned

272
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,470
there was kind of referring to a

273
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:41,269
clinician and is that is that something

274
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,129
that's sort of common for maybe

275
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:47,000
dispensaries to be referring patients to

276
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:49,669
you or is that not how you're you're

277
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,220
seeing most your patients no I well I

278
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:54,319
have a few companies that I've worked

279
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,879
with here locally in the Bay Area that

280
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,110
that know I'm here and will refer

281
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,049
you know some of the more complex

282
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,690
patients or customers that come to them

283
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:07,609
most of my referrals now are coming from

284
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:12,019
some of the larger health systems like

285
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:14,810
UC Davis Stanford UCSF those physicians

286
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:17,269
and clinicians refer there are very

287
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,638
complex patients to me who you know want

288
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,230
to use cannabis as a treatment for

289
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,769
things like chronic pain anxiety

290
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,420
depression sleep so that's exciting to

291
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:28,459
me that we're seeing that shift where

292
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:30,169
it's I know my patients are going to use

293
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,299
it I don't know anything about it my

294
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:34,818
policy that my hospital policy doesn't

295
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:36,169
allow me to really engage with the

296
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:40,068
patient in this area but here is a

297
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:42,559
trusted clinician yeah that's fantastic

298
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:45,740
and that's a really good sign that the

299
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:48,409
doctors are are opening up to to the

300
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,930
idea of using cannabis medicine and I

301
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,379
know with the population you're working

302
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:53,629
with

303
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:56,360
there is certainly a stigma associated

304
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:57,860
with with using cannabis so how

305
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,449
difficult is that to sort of navigate

306
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:04,940
when you when you're taking on new

307
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:06,979
patients you know it's it still catches

308
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,250
me off guard sometimes you know because

309
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,940
it's just to see how deep the stigma

310
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:16,940
goes you know we will see patients come

311
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,230
in who are still arms crossed you know

312
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,670
against that you know their body

313
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:24,350
language is very you know shut off you

314
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,389
know like I can't believe I'm here

315
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,339
talking to you about this and they're

316
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,169
almost a little bit like angry or

317
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:34,130
irritated that they've quote-unquote

318
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:35,448
resorted to this drug and often by the

319
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:37,399
end of the consultation through

320
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:39,159
education they start to kind of open up

321
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,240
and see it a little bit differently and

322
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,919
you know building that trusting

323
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,220
relationship with them and giving them

324
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:49,818
the space to be uncomfortable and to be

325
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:52,009
hesitant and and to explore those with

326
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:54,110
them really helps them I think become

327
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,659
more open and there are times when I've

328
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,430
met with people who are so still so

329
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:59,899
hesitant resistant that I will be very

330
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,188
honest with them and say this isn't

331
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,009
going to work with you unless you keep

332
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:05,990
an open mind you know so sometimes

333
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,430
they're bringing and they're putting up

334
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,730
such a big roadblocks that they're not

335
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,389
going to be successful so it's it's

336
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,950
fascinating

337
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:14,779
I still have one lady I've been treating

338
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,520
for over five years who hasn't told her

339
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:19,189
adult children that she's using it

340
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,990
because she spent her whole life telling

341
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,090
them to stay away from it so this guilt

342
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,399
and shame that she has around it and I'm

343
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:28,070
like they know you're doing better so

344
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,419
what do you tell them you know what's

345
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,010
your success what do you what are you

346
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,360
sharing with them and she said oh I just

347
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:37,580
tell them you know I'm just doing

348
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:40,279
alternative things I wonder if they can

349
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,139
read between the lines I was like you

350
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:44,679
know kids are a lot smarter than you

351
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:48,889
think they are even if they're adults

352
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:51,019
right and another thing I was curious

353
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,289
about with you know working with older

354
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:57,350
patients is when I spoke with dr. Bonnie

355
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:59,179
Goldstein a few episodes ago I was

356
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,909
surprised to learn that children sort of

357
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:02,799
tolerate the effects of THC better than

358
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:05,240
adults

359
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:08,000
she needs to actually kind of increase

360
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,519
the dose for children I was wondering is

361
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,830
that the same or similar with seniors do

362
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:17,000
they sort of have a difference in

363
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:18,800
sensitivity to cannabis well it's yes

364
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,279
it's the opposite though they tend to

365
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:26,059
you know as we age our metabolism slows

366
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:29,929
down our ability to process medications

367
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:32,869
decreases by about 30% so often they

368
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:36,529
need less and I've had some times where

369
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:42,679
I can I had one gentleman who was

370
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:44,389
responding to 0.33 milligrams of CBD we

371
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,879
had given it to him daily and he was

372
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,429
still having adverse effects from it so

373
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,710
we did it every three days and that was

374
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:55,099
his dose that he tolerated so you see

375
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:57,710
that they are more likely to have side

376
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,090
effects and that low dosages are often

377
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,769
enough and sometimes they don't even

378
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,820
need it daily because you know they're

379
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:04,189
building it's building up and

380
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,220
accumulating and they don't eliminate it

381
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,560
as quickly as kids will yeah I suppose

382
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:13,190
that's a good thing in terms of cost

383
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:15,459
savings yes yes especially with taxes

384
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,630
making it so expensive it does help

385
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,240
absolutely another thing I wanted to go

386
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,129
back to you said you know a lot of your

387
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,930
first consultations with folks sometimes

388
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:25,220
there's a lot about education I'm

389
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:28,519
curious what are so

390
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:31,279
the resources or the tools you use for

391
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,429
education that seem to to resonate with

392
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,620
with your patients yeah I've learned

393
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:39,739
over the years to have a lot of backup

394
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,870
materials you know because I am

395
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,700
fortunate enough to have you know 30 to

396
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,860
45 minutes with each new patient to

397
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,780
really sit with them and and understand

398
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,149
their health history and and help you

399
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:51,799
know talk about their goals and then

400
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,840
educate them on the plant but you know

401
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,059
it's it's such a steep learning curve

402
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,350
that they tend to forget a lot of that

403
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:59,959
information so I do a lot of

404
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,960
reinforcement with materials and

405
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,299
handouts that I provide them but I think

406
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,730
that the conversation I love having with

407
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:10,338
them is talking about that euphoria that

408
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,870
they're so scared of because it's you

409
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:13,609
know the the one thing that they'll come

410
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:15,708
in you know often and say don't you dare

411
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,938
recommend or you know they usually say

412
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,980
prescribe you know don't you dare

413
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:21,019
prescribe THC for me Eloise I do not

414
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,880
want to get high and you know I'll

415
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:25,129
usually smile really big and say well

416
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,709
tell me more what's that mean what does

417
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,570
it mean to get high so we have this

418
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,130
great conversation about euphoria and

419
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:32,960
how you know it can help them be more

420
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,200
relaxed and maybe more communicative

421
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,940
with their spouse and improve their mood

422
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,830
you know and help them then just feel

423
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,180
better and and that you know when you

424
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:43,389
present it to them that way they're like

425
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,490
well that doesn't sound so bad you know

426
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,800
giving them that permission to feel good

427
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,920
because you know we're encouraged to

428
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,960
find recreation in so many areas of our

429
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,500
life but if that recreation is cannabis

430
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,930
we're ashamed for it right it's

431
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,930
considered a bad thing so giving them

432
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:06,950
that permission and educating them on it

433
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:08,720
usually really it's it's it improves

434
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,650
their quality of life greatly it's

435
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,650
really fun to watch

436
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:20,269
right and so typically what sort of are

437
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,089
the the ratios that you're using to

438
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:26,420
treat the different conditions that that

439
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:31,490
you're presented with well I always like

440
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:34,460
to say it depends yeah I you know I do

441
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,500
find gender I do find differences among

442
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,920
males and females and that's part of

443
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,779
what I'll be presenting at kin

444
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,850
with a dementia population you know and

445
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:47,519
I I'm I like to start out with one

446
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:49,829
cannabinoid at a time again because the

447
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,539
older adult tends to be more sensitive

448
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:54,179
and they're more likely to have drugs or

449
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:56,309
drug interactions or even side effects

450
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,470
from cannabis if I can isolate you know

451
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:01,049
one cannabinoid at a time I have a

452
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,569
better sense of you know if they're

453
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:07,379
having a reaction you know it's clearly

454
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:09,569
its THC or it's clearly CBD there are

455
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,450
cases where I will be a little bit more

456
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:17,609
aggressive and start out I do like a one

457
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:19,170
to one for pain of CBD and THC but a lot

458
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:21,659
of times it's sort of one cannabinoid

459
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,870
building on the other and and I don't go

460
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:28,580
to ratios too often because I like to

461
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:31,229
individualize it so much for them

462
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:34,649
interesting so one of the things I had

463
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:37,890
prepared to ask was are you on the side

464
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:40,830
of whole plant or isolated compounds and

465
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,450
it seems from that answer that you're

466
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:45,480
more in the camp of the isolated

467
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:50,279
compounds well I don't know that I pick

468
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,890
isolated compounds I pick whole plant

469
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:56,160
THC products or whole plant CBD products

470
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:58,860
or older or full-spectrum CBG or

471
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,870
full-spectrum CBD a so they're always

472
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:03,509
being minor other cannabinoids in there

473
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:05,789
but the majority of it would be you know

474
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:08,009
a CBD dominant regimen that I start out

475
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:11,430
with and then they have some you know

476
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:14,940
small amounts of THC but I'm not you

477
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,710
know I rarely use isolates but I'm not

478
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,570
opposed to them because there are some

479
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:23,009
some cases where it seems appropriate

480
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:26,039
but it's the minority okay so are some

481
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:29,670
terpenes getting involved there too yeah

482
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:34,799
I mean I wish that we did a better job

483
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:36,480
of providing a CoA to to consumers and

484
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,490
patients and clinicians so that we could

485
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,610
identify these cannabinoid terpene

486
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:44,549
profiles and then you know use that to

487
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:46,649
be able to repeat it you know identify

488
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:48,450
what what this profile is that's working

489
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,960
so well so that it can be repeatable

490
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,850
instead of going in and telling them Oh

491
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,090
we'll go back and get a g.push or blue

492
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:58,939
dream or you know some of these came of

493
00:20:56,089 --> 00:21:02,178
our names that really aren't a good

494
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:05,840
indication of what's in you know what's

495
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:10,038
in the the product and may may be

496
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:12,168
misleading and not repeatable absolutely

497
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:16,250
and I actually just recently spoke with

498
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:19,340
Cindy Orser who is a she's on the lab

499
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,230
test lab testing side and she was really

500
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:23,928
talking about the importance of testing

501
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,970
for terpenes and how that's sort of a

502
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,070
blind spot for a lot of patients or a

503
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:31,579
lot of consumers that are just going

504
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:33,528
there and seeing the THC CBD and then

505
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:36,168
kind of making assumptions on a product

506
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:39,109
based on that and they could really have

507
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:42,049
a very different experience based on the

508
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:44,269
terpene profile absolutely absolutely

509
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:48,408
and sometimes at this really interesting

510
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:51,470
case just last week where this woman had

511
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:53,778
an incredibly complex medical history I

512
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,630
mean I was a little intimidated by it

513
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:59,808
and I was looking at her allergy list

514
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:01,460
and she was allergic to black pepper and

515
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:03,019
I said well tell me what your allergy is

516
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,899
to black pepper and she said oh I get

517
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:07,730
like an itchy throat and I said do you

518
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:09,469
have a hard time breathing you know want

519
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,679
to see the severity of it and she said

520
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:14,058
no and I said okay well this product

521
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,580
that I'm about to recommend to you has

522
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:18,528
beta carotene in it which you know is

523
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:20,928
thought to no we know comes from black

524
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:24,140
pepper and so I want to you know make

525
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:27,288
sure we're monitoring you for potential

526
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,090
side effects or an allergic reaction and

527
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:30,769
so she started out at a low dose and was

528
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:32,418
tolerating it quite well checked in with

529
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:35,480
her on day five and she was doing well

530
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:38,480
and then she increased her dose that

531
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:42,409
night and woke up with hives all over

532
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,179
her body so I have to assume that she

533
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:46,039
was having an allergic reaction to the

534
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:51,890
increased dose because of the beta

535
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:54,109
carotene Wow how about that so so are

536
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,179
there any any terpenes that you tend to

537
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:59,528
favor in when you're kind of

538
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:02,659
recommending products for your patients

539
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:04,309
definitely beta Karratha lean I like

540
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:07,640
that terpene if I

541
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:11,059
find Alan Ahlul and Mersin I'll

542
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,180
definitely use those as well you know

543
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:15,980
but again it can be hard to identify you

544
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,259
know I like to use companies that I know

545
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,420
are sort of vertically integrated and

546
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:22,609
are using the same kemo VAR so you know

547
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,590
once once I've identified those products

548
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:27,409
and the the terpene cannabinoid profile

549
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:29,539
I like to use them because I'm like okay

550
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,100
well likely get some consistency here

551
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:34,789
but you know a lot of products today are

552
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:39,740
distillates and it's kind of hard to

553
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:41,149
really geek out on terpenes right and

554
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,990
another thing that came up when I was

555
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:46,550
talking to Cindy was that a lot of these

556
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:49,130
producers manufacturers are now actually

557
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:52,940
putting in terpenes into their blends

558
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:55,640
and into vape cartridges and things like

559
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,380
that and her concern was that they might

560
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,450
actually be overdoing it and putting too

561
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,340
many terpenes in there and what are sort

562
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,289
of the downstream effects of that so

563
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:05,029
yeah that was really interesting too

564
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:08,089
I'll have to listen to that as that's

565
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,759
definitely my concern as well as you

566
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:12,619
know when we're you know do we know what

567
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:14,359
levels of terpenes should be in these

568
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:18,379
products I mean what are we basing it

569
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:21,649
off of and you know now recently I've

570
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:24,770
seen some of these hemp companies

571
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:29,180
testing their products for minerals

572
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:30,589
phosphorus magnesium potassium and you

573
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,310
know we don't have any standards around

574
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:36,559
these levels and I've seen you know you

575
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:38,389
know these levels are high of phosphorus

576
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,720
and potassium and magnesium and I'm like

577
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,070
well how does that affect the end-user

578
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,140
especially some of my patients who may

579
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:46,879
have a history of cardiac disease or

580
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,310
kidney disease where they can't have

581
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,770
these high levels of potassium or

582
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:53,480
magnesium you know is it is it impact

583
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:55,369
maybe it's not I don't know but I'm

584
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,500
curious about it you know just as I am

585
00:24:55,369 --> 00:25:03,259
with terpenes yeah I was pretty sure I

586
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,410
should say when I spoke with her she had

587
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:07,640
mentioned that she had tested some

588
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:12,290
products and the terpene levels were as

589
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,420
high as like 20% we're yeah we're

590
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,970
naturally occurring in the plan like it

591
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,720
rarely gets higher than 5 so that's

592
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,150
right

593
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,490
quite the increase so I told her that it

594
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:25,610
might be a good potential can med topic

595
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:27,529
so anyone out there is listening is

596
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:30,919
curious please do that research we'd

597
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:32,599
love to have you I want to go back to

598
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,370
the whole idea of the stigma but not

599
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:37,250
less on the patient side here maybe more

600
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:38,779
on the provider side and I guess the

601
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,000
first question is you know how many

602
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:43,009
other geriatric providers are out there

603
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,410
kind of treating patients with cannabis

604
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:47,240
is that number growing I know that the

605
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,830
number of seniors who are using cannabis

606
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,200
is growing but are the number of

607
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:54,409
clinicians they can turn to is that

608
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,720
growing as well you know it's hard for

609
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,640
me to assess that I would say no at

610
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,480
least not at the rate that I would like

611
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,370
it to be you know it's just so many of

612
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,440
them are coming to their clinicians now

613
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:07,819
and asking about it and their clinicians

614
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,519
are like yeah that's fine if you want to

615
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:14,480
use it and then it kind of ends there so

616
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:16,460
there's there's no real opportunities

617
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,980
for these seniors to get more

618
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,630
information about it I think we're

619
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,910
seeing and I probably have a skewed view

620
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:25,700
of it but I do see more nurses getting

621
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:29,630
into into it around education and

622
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,330
advocacy but you know not I'm not seeing

623
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,670
Jarett ition you know Garriott

624
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:36,019
geriatricians and get into it you know

625
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,410
and again with my work with that

626
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:42,319
Alzheimer dementia patients I get a lot

627
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:45,170
of referrals because they don't they

628
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:51,019
don't want to or their Hospital policy

629
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:53,870
as they can't write so it could be a

630
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:55,309
situation where a patient comes to their

631
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:56,959
doctor says that are interested in it

632
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:59,139
but they don't feel comfortable and kind

633
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,660
of refer to to someone like yourself

634
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,400
mm-hmm now how does that vary from state

635
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,620
to state I know that you know nurse

636
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,220
practitioners and some states can

637
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:12,919
administer medications and kind of do a

638
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,829
full practice where in other states it's

639
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,140
more limited mm-hmm how do you navigate

640
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:20,439
that well not you specifically but how

641
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,820
is that a difficulty for some patients

642
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,320
well nurse practitioners have been

643
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:26,990
trying to get full practice authority

644
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,730
forever you know in California requires

645
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,730
a collaborator collaborative

646
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:34,599
relationships I have a physician

647
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:36,429
who is my medical director so in some

648
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,289
states they can have full practice

649
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:41,019
Authority where they they don't need to

650
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:43,779
work with a physician and you know

651
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:47,798
there's it's it's tough because you know

652
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:50,819
we're educated to assess and diagnose

653
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:53,950
and interpret lab results and x-rays and

654
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:55,750
in some states say yes we can do that

655
00:27:53,950 --> 00:28:00,130
without a physician in some states say

656
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:01,509
that we can't and it it's it really

657
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:04,780
makes no sense to me

658
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:06,279
obviously and you just see more and more

659
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:07,720
research coming out about how there's

660
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,369
practitioners have better outcomes

661
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,900
because and I talked about this at

662
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:12,399
Canada last year you know we spend more

663
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,100
time with our patients were less likely

664
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,040
to prescribe opioids we're less likely

665
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:19,928
to have patients become go back to the

666
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,579
emergency room or be readmitted after

667
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:24,669
they leave the hospital because of our

668
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:27,789
level of care so you know in California

669
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:29,290
I would say you know because we have to

670
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,789
have this collaborative relationship

671
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,308
what has happened as many of these

672
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:36,460
physicians hire what they call as

673
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:38,798
mid-level practitioners or providers and

674
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,590
they can charge a physician rate for us

675
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,139
to see a patient and then pay us an

676
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:45,579
hourly rate so it really does to you

677
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,309
know work to their benefit financially

678
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:50,470
to have nurse practitioners under a

679
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:55,029
physician and not be able to practice

680
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:57,058
autonomously so I'll just leave that at

681
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:57,058
that

682
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,460
no but I'm familiar with nurse

683
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:06,160
practitioners and it seems like they're

684
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,950
really kind of filling the void in in

685
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,558
primary care because now there are a lot

686
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,090
of there are fewer physicians who are

687
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,450
going into primary care or family

688
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:18,639
practice because reimbursement rates and

689
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,400
things like that so yes I think you all

690
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,890
are filling a valuable need and you're

691
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,660
right tend to take more of a kind of

692
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:30,130
holistic approach whole body approach

693
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:31,360
instead of sort of specialized yeah

694
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,510
therapeutics though

695
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,579
yeah and it's it's hysterical to me

696
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:38,470
because that's like you know physicians

697
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:39,908
come out of school and they don't want

698
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,650
to get into primary care like you said

699
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:43,390
because the reimbursement rates but yet

700
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,530
they're blocking us from having full

701
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,070
practice authority

702
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:53,470
so it's just you know okay you can't

703
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:55,569
have it both ways so to anyone who's

704
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,450
listening now and you know maybe has an

705
00:29:55,569 --> 00:30:00,789
older relative who they think might be

706
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,100
might benefit from cannabis medicine

707
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:04,779
what's their first step like what what

708
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:08,439
could they do to help out their loved

709
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:10,980
one well you know if it's a serious

710
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,720
medical if they have a serious you know

711
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:16,900
medical history I would certainly look

712
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,910
in the area to see if there are any you

713
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:22,000
know knowledgeable cannabis clinicians

714
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:23,920
knowledgeable CBD clinicians who can

715
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,440
help you know do a thorough health

716
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,740
history and determine you know risk

717
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:33,070
versus benefit of using the cannabis and

718
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,359
I you know my the thing I always tell

719
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:36,009
people is if you're going to work with

720
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:37,959
the cannabis clinician make sure they're

721
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:39,940
telling you you know how much to take

722
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,950
how often to take it they're reviewing

723
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,500
potential side effects that you may have

724
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,539
from the cannabis therapy potential drug

725
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,180
to drug interactions and that they're

726
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:51,430
there monitoring them so that they can

727
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,100
adjust things as they go because you

728
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,980
know often people come to cannabis and

729
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:58,480
lately CBD and they just think that it's

730
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,750
a one and done I'm going to take this

731
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,490
and it's gonna be good to go and you

732
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,750
know because they're friends or other

733
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,599
people they know are having success

734
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:11,109
already so it really is you know

735
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,459
sometimes it can take months for us to

736
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:14,469
get them the right treatment plan

737
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,509
especially if they're suffering from

738
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,460
age-related and chronic illness you know

739
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:22,960
it's not a silver bullet it's not gonna

740
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:26,170
just work overnight right and so I guess

741
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,789
where do you start with sure and you

742
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,930
said that can kind of be this this long

743
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:34,029
process so where do you start

744
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:36,190
yeah with me particularly um

745
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:37,720
I mean someone will book an appointment

746
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,450
with me and I have them fill out a very

747
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,269
thorough health history and then we have

748
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,759
the appointment you know discussing the

749
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:47,349
goals and sometimes I'll identify other

750
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,140
things that I think cannabis could be

751
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:51,639
helpful with and then you know what I do

752
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,380
is provide them with the treatment plan

753
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,960
here's you know here's the cannabinoid

754
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,660
profile I want you to obtain here's how

755
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,819
I want you to take it

756
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:03,090
and I go very low and slow obviously

757
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:05,129
because 90% of the people that come to

758
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:08,759
me are cannabis naive I mean they they

759
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:11,220
haven't even touched it ever so I try to

760
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,690
empower them in terms of you know giving

761
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,720
them a treatment plan that says take

762
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,860
this dose wait three days and if your

763
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,420
side that you know your symptoms are

764
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,509
still there then you increase it to this

765
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:23,940
dose so it's very I spell it out for

766
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:26,640
them as much as I can you know so that

767
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,740
they really can feel confident in the

768
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,520
way that they're approaching it you know

769
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:35,190
that they have again building that trust

770
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,049
and giving them an opportunity to see

771
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,500
how it affects them and take note of it

772
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:42,569
and take a journal and write it down and

773
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,490
start empowering them to be more

774
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:48,089
involved in their health care and

775
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:49,740
outcomes not not everybody has access to

776
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:52,769
somebody like me and so that's the

777
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:57,180
challenge challenge right especially if

778
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:58,859
you're in a state that's illegal so you

779
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,960
know it's that there's you know

780
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:03,209
obviously the American cannabis Nurses

781
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,600
Association there's society Society of

782
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:08,640
cannabis clinicians these are nonprofit

783
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,799
organizations that are helping to

784
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,620
educate and train more clinicians out

785
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,220
there and to try to reach you know as

786
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:19,529
many people as we can and do you have a

787
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,299
preferred route of administration or

788
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:23,519
something that seems to work better than

789
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:27,419
others or is it sort of patient

790
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,420
dependent yeah I mean I I certainly have

791
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,610
found you know certain conditions will

792
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,250
respond to certain you know to different

793
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:38,789
routes better somebody who has severe

794
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:41,700
chronic pain inhalation tends to be the

795
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:43,440
most effective it works quickly it's the

796
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,590
most predictable it gives them the most

797
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,210
control over their experience and so

798
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:50,250
there sometimes can be a lot of

799
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,840
education around that because they may

800
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,700
come to me and say you know I'm not

801
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,379
gonna smoke it and it's very

802
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,970
counterintuitive to think that inhaling

803
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,550
anything is going to benefit their

804
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:02,370
health but you know giving them some

805
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:04,680
education around that often if they

806
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:06,419
won't consider it at first they may come

807
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,220
back to it if there's you know just look

808
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,590
like I'm like how successful do you want

809
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:11,250
to be you know are we just going to

810
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,120
dance around

811
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,199
a little better do you want to go

812
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,628
straight to what I think is going to

813
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,408
help you right away and sometimes less

814
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:22,949
I'd rather dance around it a little bit

815
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:24,840
you know older people definitely come to

816
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:26,519
me and they want to cream you know

817
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,280
they're like I want a cream or a bomb or

818
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:33,000
a salve so like a topical and then a

819
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,820
tincture is often probably the second

820
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,500
thing that I'll recommend because it's

821
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,950
you know easy for them to kind of

822
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:44,280
titrate and it feels more medicinal to

823
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:46,378
them they tend to overeat edibles right

824
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,019
because they taste good and they don't

825
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:51,239
really understand the delayed onset and

826
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:54,509
you know even if I do educate them and

827
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:56,339
say just take one I can't tell you how

828
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,870
many times I've gotten a call like well

829
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,340
that was really strong okay well how

830
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:02,759
many did you take how I eat the whole

831
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,620
thing okay thank you I tell say no and

832
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,480
you you try to tell them not to and it's

833
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:10,589
just like I said people forget so

834
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,059
they're not going to over consume a

835
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:17,190
tincture because they generally don't

836
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:19,049
taste not great right and and I know

837
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,490
your presentation this year is gonna be

838
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,680
talking about treating patients with

839
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:24,269
Alzheimer's and dementia I was wondering

840
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:28,230
if you could speak a little bit more to

841
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:31,259
that yeah it's an area that I really

842
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,650
have enjoyed being a part of and I'm

843
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,120
fortunate in my area I've had some

844
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,889
assisted living communities and boarding

845
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:42,809
care facilities that have been early

846
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:46,549
adopters and willing to dispense you

847
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:49,489
know cannabis to their residents because

848
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:52,050
you know we don't have any fda-approved

849
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:54,779
pharmaceuticals for their behavior as

850
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:58,230
they go into these severe agitation and

851
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,450
aggressive behaviors so often they're

852
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,429
giving these off-label medications that

853
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:05,009
just have horrible side effects and

854
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:06,719
black box warnings meaning you know the

855
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:09,150
risk of death is higher in this

856
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:12,179
population so it's very you know

857
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:14,700
stressful for the family it's stressful

858
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:18,480
for the staff at these communities that

859
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:20,699
are caring for them and you know we have

860
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,610
been trying cannabis we started this

861
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:24,449
about five years ago and it's just grown

862
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,130
you know

863
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:28,409
and now I mean sometimes when the

864
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,329
residents before they even come into the

865
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:33,269
facility the families like call Eloise

866
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:35,730
get on this regimen because they see

867
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:37,309
such great success in terms of managing

868
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,320
you know they're more redirect about

869
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:43,469
they're calmer sometimes they're kind of

870
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,588
you know laughing again you know all

871
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:49,578
those benefits of that euphoria and that

872
00:36:46,588 --> 00:36:54,750
we can see in this population is just

873
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:57,690
it's life changing when it works well I

874
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:00,179
know that prior to your presentation it

875
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:02,490
came a 20-19 which you can see at cam in

876
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:05,789
events calm nice little plug there

877
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:07,889
you mentioned the story of Lucy at the

878
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:10,440
beginning of the presentation which was

879
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:13,259
really interesting and you had said that

880
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,358
you actually after getting her onto

881
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,970
cannabis actually managed to get her

882
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,480
dementia diagnosis removed is that

883
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,149
correct

884
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,480
her daughter did all that hard work yep

885
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,750
and how they had it removed how cool is

886
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,349
that

887
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:31,559
that sounds pretty remarkable I would

888
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:35,809
say you know there are an exam that

889
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:40,318
family is an example of family that just

890
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:43,679
was so supportive right when when Lucy

891
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:46,469
got her her mind back and lost all that

892
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,328
way and you know there was no dementia

893
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:51,629
anymore and the daughter was just a

894
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:54,210
fierce advocate for her mom and had

895
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:58,588
Kaiser remove it from her diagnosis list

896
00:37:54,210 --> 00:38:01,289
of diagnoses it's very uncommon well

897
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:04,429
