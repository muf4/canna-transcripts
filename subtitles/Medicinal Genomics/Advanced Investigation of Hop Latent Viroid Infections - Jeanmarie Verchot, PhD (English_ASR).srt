1
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:11,439
I got my PhD in 1995 I've worked on a

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:14,638
wide range of plant viral diseases and

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:17,039
um I've met folks uh I joined let's see

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,079
I joined Texas A&amp;M about five years ago

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,800
and I've been working on a wide range of

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,358
of problems and I got involved with hopl

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,080
and vroid when I met folks from Rare

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,640
Earth genomics and started working with

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:33,119
uh Russ Jessup U who's a breeder at

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,878
Texas A&amp;M to try to tackle some of these

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,399
these questions and issues and uh while

12
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:40,119
I could say I'm an expert at plant

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,399
virology I'm also feeling like I'm an

14
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:46,439
expert at something in Hop light and

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,079
vroid we know very little about so um so

16
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,238
I'm excited to be here and I'm excited

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,239
to take on this

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,320
project there we go

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,640
so um we've developed an infectious

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,359
clone of hop and vroid and uh this is

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,400
actually my my starting talk I am in the

22
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:15,359
Plant Pathology Department at at Texas

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,520
A&amp;M and this is an example of some

24
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,478
plants that we infected in our growth

25
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,798
chamber and one of the biggest questions

26
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:25,319
that we have is you can look at these

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,200
plants and the same variety has

28
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,758
different disease patterns so how do we

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,920
explain the disease how do we conquer

30
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,519
the disease how do we recognize the

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,118
disease um there's one healthy plant

32
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:42,478
here in the corner and you can see very

33
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,920
severely um chlorotic plants and mildly

34
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,879
chlorotic plants and they were all

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,359
inoculated at the same time um and so

36
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,599
this creates a challenge in itself for

37
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:55,399
working with Growers trying to help them

38
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:58,319
identify healthy from infected

39
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,359
materials and I wanted to start by

40
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,679
telling you a little bit more more about

41
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,438
the life cycle of viroids so it's very

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,879
easy for non virologists to think a

43
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,478
vroid and a virus are the same thing

44
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,280
they have the same life cycle and they

45
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,440
really are quite different um viroids

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,680
are small circular RNA molecules that

47
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,159
don't encode for any protein they're

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,680
only 250 nucleotides in length um which

49
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:30,439
is crazy small um I work on RNA viruses

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,439
that are 10,000 uh base pairs in LAN so

51
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:35,560
250 is about as small of an infectious

52
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,439
agent as you can get because they don't

53
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,120
encode any proteins they are kind of a

54
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:44,280
miracle I think because um how do they

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,840
cause such an amazing disease and cause

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,080
so much changes to a cell into a plant

57
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,719
Without Really encoding anything at all

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,040
um hot PL and vroid is a circular RNA

59
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:59,878
this is its replication cycle um it

60
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,318
encodes a single strand nucleic acid and

61
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,239
and it replicates in the plant cell

62
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,598
nucleus so it depends upon the host

63
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,439
Machinery in order to replicate and

64
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,318
cause

65
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,400
infection um and so the host RNA

66
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:16,119
polymerase um acts on the genome and

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,519
produces a copy and that copy then

68
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,280
serves as a template for production of

69
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,560
multiple strands and each of those are

70
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,519
produced and circularized and it

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,640
continues through a cycle of synthesis

72
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,560
and

73
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,759
replication and it's able to spread

74
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,920
through throughout the plant so that

75
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,759
means it must exit the nucleus move

76
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,318
through plasma desata between cells

77
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:40,120
enter the vascular system and somehow

78
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,839
Rec havoc on these plants hopl and vroid

79
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,280
causes dud disease in case you don't

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,959
know um and so it's interesting for me

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,959
as a plant virologist to try to

82
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,920
understand how a 250 nucleotide amino

83
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,519
acid can um cause a latent infection

84
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,759
where you don't see any symptoms for a

85
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,799
while and then suddenly um destroy the

86
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,120
flowering ability and um affect its

87
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,640
complete

88
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:11,480
development um so thyroids many viroids

89
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,359
not just top latent vroid are latent

90
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:17,439
viruses they are latent diseases it's

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,280
quite common amongst the um

92
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,279
vroid uh pathogens that they cause

93
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,439
latent infections and then you don't see

94
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:26,839
them until much later one example is

95
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:30,680
peach latent vroid there's huge problems

96
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:33,239
of viroids in stone fruits um Peach is

97
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,240
one example and you don't see disease

98
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,918
until the plants start until the trees

99
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,199
start to wither so because of there are

100
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:45,120
issues in stone fruits as well as in in

101
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:49,879
um in Hops and in hemp they are

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:53,439
economically very important category of

103
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:56,399
pathogens um and as you know uh hop plat

104
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,600
and vroid causes extremely important

105
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,279
significant problems in the in the hemp

106
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,199
industry which is how we got involved in

107
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,959
this and so as we got involved about

108
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,960
year and a half two years ago working on

109
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,478
hopl and viroid we started developing

110
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,959
the tools to detect it um one of our

111
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:17,000
first most important questions was early

112
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:21,560
detection of hopl and vroid in infected

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,160
plants and um uh how do you know if you

114
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,800
and the the main approach is to use a

115
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,800
PCR technology and we're very concerned

116
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,840
about quality control and our research

117
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,400
in our efforts and making sure that we

118
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,239
get true positive results not false

119
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,399
positive results true negative results

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,079
not false negative results so when

121
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:45,879
you're dealing with a plant with such an

122
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:48,198
array of no symptoms to severe closis um

123
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,159
and death how do you know that you might

124
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:54,280
have missed a positive outcome and so

125
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,919
one of our T PCR Technologies has

126
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,719
allowed us to identify the genome which

127
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,839
is 256 nucleotide Sid Es as well as

128
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,840
replicating intermediates which can be

129
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:09,879
500 to 750 up to 1,000 um this virid as

130
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,159
it replicates produces multimer of

131
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,240
itself and then they cleave into mature

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,599
products so we've been able to detect

133
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,960
the replicating units both as monomers

134
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,240
diers and

135
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:22,519
trimers and through this technology

136
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,038
we've also developed infectious clones

137
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,918
that are themselves monomers diers and

138
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:30,680
trimers and are using that to inoculate

139
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,879
plants so we can begin to study

140
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,879
uniformity of inoculation uniformity of

141
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:40,319
infection and start to provide real um

142
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:43,159
uh workflows for how to identify the

143
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,919
problem how to solve the problems how to

144
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,560
uh make sure your mother plants are

145
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,879
clean um so our major goal right now is

146
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,360
to understand uh some of the things

147
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,079
we're interested in is understanding

148
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,800
nonhost resistance as a guidance for

149
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,560
design and thyroid resistant plants

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,840
we're looking at screening germ plasms

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,720
to identify germ plasms that may not be

152
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,878
susceptible to hopl and vroid that would

153
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,560
be

154
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,960
nonhost and compare them and perform

155
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,560
crosses with very susceptible plants and

156
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,359
see if we can understand the genetic

157
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,560
basis of resistance we're wanting to

158
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,639
understand what happens in the host

159
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,038
during latency that's different from

160
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,598
what happens to the host during severe

161
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:25,719
symptoms um what is the viroid doing is

162
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,399
it just dormant not doing anything or is

163
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,280
it doing something metabolically that

164
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,478
the host actually is having an immune

165
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,559
respon response maybe after latency that

166
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:38,918
immune response is failing so we need to

167
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,519
understand what is the host response um

168
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,680
and how immunity functions against vroid

169
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:47,000
diseases and then we'd like to engineer

170
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,560
vroid resistance using a range of Novel

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,279
Technologies um and so these questions

172
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,319
that we're asking they're also asking in

173
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,878
a wide range of of um other viroid

174
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,879
diseases globally um the problems that

175
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,319
we're facing in in hemp with toate and

176
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,919
vroid are the same problems they're

177
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,439
facing in stone fruits like apricot

178
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,878
plums

179
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:11,598
peaches um and so what I also wanted to

180
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,479
to start my talk was differentiate hop

181
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:17,240
Laten vroid from Hop stunt vroid um I

182
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,079
found in talking with folks that it's

183
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,400
very easy to mix the two up they are

184
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,279
actually two different species of

185
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,239
thyroids they both infect hops they both

186
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,519
seem to cause a stunting when they cause

187
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,240
disease but hop stunt vroid is a

188
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:34,240
different uh organism together um hop

189
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,879
stunt vroid infects hops it infects

190
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,639
grape Vines it infects Citrus cucumbers

191
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,399
and a range of stone fruits hop latent

192
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:44,000
vroid which is a huge problem for the

193
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,080
hemp industry and cannabis industry does

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,080
not infect those

195
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,639
hosts um we uh did a sample when we

196
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,800
began this work of over 111 plants and

197
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,639
we found that 80% of those were infected

198
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,439
with hop lat and vroid and we found no

199
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,879
evidence of Hop stunt vroid co-infecting

200
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,760
these plants so we're clearly looking at

201
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:10,879
a single infection problem not a

202
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:15,399
potential for mixture of the two

203
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,958
um and so um I wanted to throw in some

204
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,240
pictures of folks that are working with

205
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,359
us and again pictures of our friends at

206
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,759
Rare Earth genomics that are helping to

207
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,079
support this research uh this is one of

208
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,559
the scientists in my program who was uh

209
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:30,838
speaking with our collaborators um and

210
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,799
these are some of the experiments that

211
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,560
he's been running we've been interested

212
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,759
in looking at developing sensitive

213
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,399
detection methods we want to perform

214
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,919
assessments of vroid host interactions

215
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
we're looking right now at different

216
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:47,240
hopl and vroid variants and comparing

217
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,519
the different variance across different

218
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,839
plant genotypes and trying to track the

219
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,480
progression of the

220
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,160
disease major fundamental question are

221
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,320
there different strains of hop plate and

222
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,559
vroid is there a severe strain and a

223
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,879
mild strain so the we're trying to tease

224
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,159
All Those Questions apart and it also

225
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,240
requires understanding the different

226
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,120
genotypes of the hosts that we're

227
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,200
working with and so here's an example of

228
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,720
some of our experiments uh perhaps

229
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,800
there's different variants between the

230
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,160
two different hosts and so how we're

231
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,919
going about solving that is using

232
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,278
infectious clone technology when we take

233
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:25,679
sap from an infected plant that we get

234
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:27,600
from uh from a grower we don't know if

235
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,120
that infected material that we get from

236
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,159
him uh has a mixture of variants or is a

237
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,000
single variant or a single strain so

238
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,799
using our infectious clone technology we

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,159
can make one single strain one single

240
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,159
variant and introduce that into a

241
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,360
variety of different genotypes and start

242
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:47,480
to characterize the nature of the

243
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,039
symptoms the nature of the disease and

244
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,320
then we can start adding new layers of

245
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,799
different variants and making

246
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,720
comparisons between them so this is some

247
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,838
fundamental work that we're performing

248
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,800
now um and again we've identified seven

249
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,920
we are examining and working with 71

250
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,479
different isolates we found 41 different

251
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,958
mutations across the populations and we

252
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,600
are now looking at how these different

253
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:11,719
mutations influence

254
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,600
symptoms and so this is one of our

255
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,720
exciting new um PCR Diagnostics that we

256
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,800
developed we've developed some PCR

257
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,120
primers that overlap a highly conserved

258
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:25,159
region of the viral genome and it's

259
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,200
extremely sensitive we can take an an

260
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:30,278
asymptomatic leaf that we know we

261
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,839
infected the plant we know it's infected

262
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:35,039
but it's not producing any symptoms and

263
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,720
we've been able to develop a diagnostic

264
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:42,199
PCR that can detect 10 to the n 10 to

265
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:46,839
Theus 9th molecules of

266
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:49,759
infection um and so we're moving forward

267
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:53,600
with our diagnostic um analysis we've

268
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:56,360
compared using infectious sap uh and

269
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,879
we've also used our infectious clone

270
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,320
that we've uh generated in our

271
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:02,240
laboratory and we wanted to understand

272
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,000
if you use sap from an infected plant

273
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,799
that we've taken from the field is our

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,600
infectious clone technology as sensitive

275
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:13,039
as robust of an inoculum as taking sap

276
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,560
from an infected plant and as you can

277
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:19,559
see when we're looking at inoculated

278
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:21,599
plants at 26 days 39 days 60 days and

279
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:24,958
then when we use our own in-house

280
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,159
infection system at 21 and at 42 days we

281
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,638
see 100% of our plants are infected

282
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:33,399
systemically and 100% of our plants are

283
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,720
infected locally whereas the Infectious

284
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,519
sap is a little slower at producing

285
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,199
infection in some hosts um so we're

286
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,519
comfortable with our Technologies we're

287
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:45,719
able to move forward this is a study

288
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,759
that we performed using different hosts

289
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,800
we want to understand how many different

290
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,838
plant species are infected with hop plat

291
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,799
and vroid that are not reported in the

292
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,680
literature in fact very few people are

293
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,559
working on this problem at all I've um

294
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,759
traveled through Europe every everyone I

295
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:04,278
know in Europe is working on hops stunt

296
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,759
vroid which is a huge problem in the

297
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:09,759
Hops industry there and I have yet to

298
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:14,519
meet uh an academic that's working on

299
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:16,720
Hop L and vroid full-time as their um as

300
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,399
as their problem apparently Europe is

301
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,000
restricting the ability to do this type

302
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,879
of work um as well as many states in the

303
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,720
US so we're really happy that in Texas

304
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,320
we're able to do our studies on Hop PL

305
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,639
and vroid um we found it infects

306
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,560
cucumber in infects tomato and it causes

307
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:38,000
some pretty pretty severe death of

308
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,799
chrysanthemum so uh if you are a uh

309
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,679
vegetable Gardener as well as a grower

310
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,399
you may want to be aware of your

311
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,198
vegetables as being a reservoir or or

312
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:51,000
your chrysanthemum plants in your flower

313
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,000
garden as being a reservoir for

314
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,959
disease um this is an example of our PCR

315
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,679
diagnostic so you can see what kind of

316
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,518
results we get when we look at our

317
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,758
different um plant hosts we get very

318
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,679
clean very robust PCR products across

319
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,360
our plants those that are negative is

320
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:12,000
our healthy here uh just to show you how

321
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,159
our how our data looks um we found in

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,958
our studies that arabidopsis plants

323
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,838
which is a model genetic system um

324
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,958
arabidopsis was one of the first major

325
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,279
uh plant genomes to be sequenced and it

326
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:29,599
is a model like dropa is a model for um

327
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:32,320
for human genetics Mamon genetics seelan

328
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,759
arabidopsis is our plant model genetic

329
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,800
system that's used uh globally for uh

330
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,440
UND dissecting genetics and we found

331
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,439
it's highly susceptible to hoplon vroid

332
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,440
which is exciting because it's the only

333
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,639
vroid that is known to infect a rabid

334
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,000
opsis um and it also infects cucumber

335
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:56,240
and we found that those plants die at

336
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,078
maturity um and so this is an example of

337
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,159
of a a Rabbid opsis plants that we have

338
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:04,078
growing in pots

339
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:06,719
and the infected hlate and vroid

340
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,758
infected plants once they reach maturity

341
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,839
it's called a decline or a dieback

342
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,120
disease the plants don't die until they

343
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,560
reach maturity and then you see the

344
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,799
necrosis the death the the Browning

345
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:19,119
tissue just going backwards down towards

346
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:22,519
the base of the

347
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,399
plant um for me that's exciting it's a

348
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,639
it's a novel symptom and it's a way we

349
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,919
can characterize and start using rabid

350
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,799
opsis genetics to um

351
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,318
uh to study Decline and here's an

352
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,120
example of younger plants that we

353
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:36,439
infected with hopl and vroid using

354
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,519
different versions of the Infectious

355
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,680
clone and with a higher level of

356
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,959
inoculum we can see earlier decline of

357
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,638
the tissue this is a healthy infected

358
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,799
healthy plant and then all of these

359
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,720
declined quite rapidly before they could

360
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,799
produce

361
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:54,440
flowers um so again here's our Mock and

362
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,198
here's our uh a mutant version of hopl

363
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,480
and vroid that's not supposed to produce

364
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:01,359
a dieback and as you can see the

365
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,800
mutation eliminated the dieback

366
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,480
phenotype um so we're excited to now

367
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:07,559
have good diagnostic tools a good

368
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,120
infectious clone technology and a good

369
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:12,479
genetics that we can begin to look for

370
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,000
host nonhost resistance and understand

371
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,879
host immunity

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,799
responses um as we've moved forward one

373
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,600
of the major questions that we wanted to

374
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:23,758
start looking at is developing a

375
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,639
workflow for how to sample how to

376
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,240
perform Diagnostics in hemp when you

377
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:30,318
have a latent vroid where do you sample

378
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,079
if you get a NE negative result did you

379
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:34,719
sample the right

380
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,439
tissue um or do you have to keep

381
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,199
sampling how often do you have to keep

382
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,519
sampling to make sure that your mother

383
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:45,359
plants are healthy and remain healthy um

384
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,759
and so our approach has been uh to

385
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,519
develop a strict inoculation technique

386
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,800
where oops sweet does that go back yes

387
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,078
we inoculate a specific leaf on the

388
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:58,240
plant and then we start sampling all the

389
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,799
way up the plant to identify where does

390
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,440
the virus move move first if you

391
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:05,000
inoculate one leaf 3 weeks later where

392
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,038
is the vroid 4 Weeks Later where is the

393
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,439
vroid 6 weeks later where is the vroid

394
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,160
and can we track its movement up the

395
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,519
plant is it doing something unexpected

396
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,319
as you know um as you may know the

397
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,519
literature has shown that the vroid this

398
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:20,519
vroid tends to move to the roots first

399
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,400
and then moves further up the plant next

400
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,679
um and so the best sampling results can

401
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,640
often occur by testing Roots early and

402
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,160
then testing the tops of the plants

403
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,640
later um with our new sensitive Tech PCR

404
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,720
technology uh we're been looking working

405
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,520
at verifying that pathway for virus

406
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,160
infection in plants and uh continuing

407
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:45,200
our PCR testing uh to streamline a

408
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,480
protocol in a way that we're not

409
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
damaging the plants but we can reduce

410
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,839
the amount of times you have to sample

411
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,440
and test at the same time we're trying

412
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,159
to understand the kinds of symptoms we

413
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,519
can see with different variants of the

414
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,440
viroids so we can be the experts of

415
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,639
telling you how to manage disease in

416
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,480
your crop

417
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,480
um so here's an example uh based on our

418
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,319
new knowledge of the dieback symptoms

419
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,079
that we see with hop PL and vroid in

420
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:16,720
arabidopsis we wanted to ask can we see

421
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:18,599
similar phenotypes happening in hemp or

422
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,120
yeah hemp is what we're working on in

423
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:25,839
Texas so um what we were excited

424
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:28,798
recently we this here is an example of

425
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:31,839
Brandy Wine variety or cherry wine

426
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,839
variety I apologize um and you can see

427
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,558
that the leaves are starting to die off

428
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,798
on the plant and it's looking pretty

429
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:40,798
sick um at maturity but you know how do

430
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,480
you know if your plant's just sessing

431
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:49,000
naturally or maybe there's a nutritional

432
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,319
issue and it's die back or not we've um

433
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,038
we're starting to feel more and more

434
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,319
comfortable that when we inoculate a

435
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:56,839
plant we switched over to using another

436
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,798
variety called Puma 3 in this variety

437
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:02,879
you see extreme yellowing of leaves

438
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:05,158
within 2 weeks we can inoculate a plant

439
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,600
2 weeks later we see this extreme

440
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,640
yellowing here and then this is what the

441
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:13,279
top of the plant looks like in in other

442
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,640
examples where you get this crazy Mosaic

443
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,759
pattern on the plants and so by

444
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,400
controlled inoculations and testing

445
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,480
different varieties we can then start

446
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,559
reporting what you should see when

447
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,480
certain varieties are infected with

448
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:31,279
certain variants of the viroid so it's

449
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,880
exciting for us that that with um uh

450
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,158
Puma 3 we get this yellowing and this

451
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,159
plant progresses to Yellow every week

452
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,440
until it just completely turns dead

453
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,799
completely

454
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,798
dies um and this is work that's being

455
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,400
done uh by another student in our in our

456
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:50,879
lab uh s Sydney Abbott who's been

457
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,720
managing our propagation she's quite

458
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,400
excited to see uh this is example of

459
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,360
Puma 3 is just continuing to Yellow this

460
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,159
is the uninfected healthy version of the

461
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:03,759
plant you can see the severe differences

462
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,360
between infected and healthy and uh it's

463
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:09,319
the only time I've seen a grower who's

464
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,879
excited that she's gotten infection in

465
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,480
At first she was scared she's like oh my

466
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
plants don't look good I'm like no this

467
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,440
looks great this is fantastic this is

468
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,200
what we want to see so um so we're proud

469
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,798
of the direction that this work is going

470
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,880
in so what we can say right now is we

471
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:28,119
believe that we have that hopl and vroid

472
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,440
causes a dieback disease that the

473
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,639
yellowing and the phenotypes that we see

474
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,880
is is an example of the symptoms that

475
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,120
you can see early uh we're starting to

476
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,840
work at developing technologies that

477
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:43,079
maybe can pick up on the vroid before

478
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:46,359
you see that extreme dieback and maybe

479
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,918
ways of managing the plants um we're

480
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,959
comfortable with saying this dieback

481
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,320
disease is what the disease should look

482
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,558
like based on studies for instance with

483
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:59,158
peach latent Mosaic vroid um uh this is

484
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,918
an example of infected Peach latent

485
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,480
where the plants look great until they

486
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,640
don't you know um you can see the plants

487
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,679
look like they don't have very much

488
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,240
leaves on them this is example of

489
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,880
infected peaches versus healthy Peaches

490
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,480
I mean how do you know that you have

491
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,760
infected peaches until you started your

492
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,839
Harvest very similar problems to what

493
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:21,440
we're having in the hemp industry so the

494
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:24,038
vroid problems that we're having here in

495
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,120
the hemp industry aren't unique virid

496
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:29,119
problems to just hemp but these are

497
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:31,158
Global issues that we as a community

498
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,918
within the vord community can start

499
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,600
discussing amongst each other and I can

500
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,960
pull plls from some of my colleagues uh

501
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,038
working on other crops and work towards

502
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,120
common Solutions and build on their

503
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:45,158
knowledge to uh to uh help find

504
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,359
solutions for this industry so we're

505
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:50,320
really excited to be moving in this

506
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:52,759
direction um you can see the differences

507
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,038
in the healthy and infected Stone fruits

508
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,798
healthy and infected leaves flowers

509
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:00,119
change colors all these are symptoms but

510
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:02,119
they're not obvious symptoms to a grower

511
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:07,000
they might be anything

512
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:08,798
else so um as we're moving forward uh

513
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,359
this is an example that I wanted to pull

514
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:14,119
also from Peach Lon vroid to show you

515
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:18,918
how you've got this 250

516
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:21,319
nucleotide size pathogen and a single

517
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,480
variant with which means a change in a

518
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:27,000
couple of couple of nucleotides can

519
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,440
completely change the symptoms that you

520
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,079
see so in this example this is a diagram

521
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,000
oops sorry this is a diagram of what the

522
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:40,678
peach Lon vroid looks like when it's

523
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,880
folded into its mature State and what

524
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:47,880
this shows here in panel B is these four

525
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,559
nucleotides are changed here and look at

526
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,640
the difference in the

527
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:57,440
symptoms this is an asymptomatic disease

528
00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:00,200
and this is a complete chotic uh disease

529
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,400
so based on that knowledge we started

530
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,640
looking at a number of informative

531
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,080
mutations and as I've mentioned we have

532
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,278
a total of 41 mutations in our current

533
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,359
population of hopl and vroid we have

534
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:15,200
been performing some bioinformatic

535
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,558
analysis to understand which are

536
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,240
probably the most informative and useful

537
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:22,000
mutations to go after to study and we

538
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,319
are starting now to look at the effects

539
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
of different mutations on dieback and

540
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,798
closis in plants so hopefully this time

541
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,880
next year we'll have some up ated

542
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,240
information for you on what types of

543
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,440
symptoms that we

544
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,159
see um so I wanted to end my talk the

545
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,759
same way that we began uh with a thank

546
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,640
you to Rare Earth genomics uh for their

547
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:47,200
uh contribution support funding for This

548
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,278
research without them we would not be

549
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,919
even beginning to explore this very

550
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:56,519
important problem um and uh again to our

551
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,038
our colleagues at Texas A&amp;M who have

552
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,480
been working in the breeding programs

553
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:03,119
and devel velopment of improved genetics

554
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,160
along with rare earth genomics and uh

555
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:11,778
Texas A&amp;M University so thank you very

556
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,778
[Applause]

557
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,399
much any

558
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,039
questions

559
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,440
yes how is the viroid transmitted in

560
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:25,119
nature transmission of the virid in

561
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,320
nature there this thyroid we don't even

562
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,959
know what if there's an insect Vector

563
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:32,839
what the insect vector is there's really

564
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,919
very little work done on this problem um

565
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:40,000
which is shocking and also for me quite

566
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:44,240
exciting I can make some Headway on this

567
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,839
um we do know that it's it's extremely

568
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,720
um infectious you get one infected plant

569
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,359
it spreads through everything and to me

570
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,278
that's not much different from tobacco

571
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:54,839
mosaic virus where the Dew in or the

572
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,720
humidity in the greenhouse can be enough

573
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,599
to spread it through the greenhouse or

574
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,278
you get it on your hands and you can

575
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,439
transmit it um I would advise if you

576
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,839
have an infected plant you be wearing

577
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,320
gloves and change gloves between

578
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,918
individual plants and take your cutting

579
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,558
tools and your pruning tools bleach them

580
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,440
in between plants so that you don't

581
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:19,558
transmit them um we recommend different

582
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,278
virus sides for treating bench stops and

583
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:23,278
the like to keep everything under

584
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,519
control yes

585
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,038
on that picture on the left and um at

586
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,720
least one other on that you showed the

587
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:40,599
control plan that was not inoculated

588
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,759
what's the smallest one is that by

589
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:46,278
chance or is have these all been

590
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:48,679
inoculated at the same time or are the

591
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,278
different variants because it's you know

592
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,360
what what we see in our in our Gardens

593
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,519
is that the the infected ones are the

594
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,519
smallest

595
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,639
ones okay yeah so good question these

596
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,200
were not clly propagated these were

597
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,159
grown from seed and so there's some

598
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,159
heterogeneity in the

599
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
seeds

600
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:14,960
so investigated some mutants in

601
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,720
arabidopsis such as replication factors

602
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,399
or small RNA molecules Transportation

603
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,640
within the plants have you already used

604
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:24,759
these mutants to address is the

605
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,960
replication mechanism or the transport

606
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:29,640
of the molecules within the plants so

607
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,000
that's some ongoing work that we have

608
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,038
going on right now and I'm not at

609
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,038
Liberty to speak about it

610
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,038
so

611
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,080
yes so um whenever you're working in a

612
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,759
room uh with infected plants and you're

613
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,639
saying change gloves and clean your your

614
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:52,480
work toop and bench Toops and all the

615
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,640
tools that you're using I've heard

616
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,159
because this viroid is so small that

617
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,559
it's very very hard to to kill because

618
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:01,679
of that reason what is like a protocol

619
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:03,759
that you'll use in your laboratory to

620
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,640
stay as sterile as

621
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,240
possible very good question um we've

622
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,919
just gone through a major cleanout we so

623
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,679
you see the plants are on the benches

624
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:19,080
there between experiments we bleach the

625
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,559
entire bench um with 10% bleach um and

626
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,278
everyone has to wear a lab coat when

627
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,038
they're near our plants the lab coat

628
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:26,759
stays in the room you don't leave the

629
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:29,079
room with the lab coat uh gloves stay in

630
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,240
the room all of our tools TOs and shears

631
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:33,158
stay in the room they don't leave that

632
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:38,120
room so we're not spreading it from room

633
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:40,200
to room with us um we disinfect um our

634
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:42,479
tools regularly it's usually about 10%

635
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,960
bleach works very well um one of my

636
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,480
favorite is um uh cleaners is called

637
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,720
vercon um I use that on the floors quite

638
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,919
a bit they use that also in um in

639
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,079
dairies for making sure that uh animal

640
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,679
uh facilities are clean as well it's a

641
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:01,278
it's a commonly used

642
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,720
uh virus side uh mixed with other

643
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,480
cleaners and um we've used it in many

644
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,679
green houses in um over the last two

645
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,798
decades quite successfully um all pots

646
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,200
have to be bleached before they're

647
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:17,839
reused um or treated with

648
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,319
Veron um and then some of the new um uh

649
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,720
cleaners that have come out since covid

650
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,759
work quite well against other viroids so

651
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,880
you can even go to Lowe's and pick up

652
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,798
some of the household cleaners that are

653
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,000
supposed to be viricidal

654
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,558
um I think Jeep is one of the ones that

655
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,599
they talk about and that works also as

656
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,599
well and it's safe for

657
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:43,720
humans so I'm not a botanist or anything

658
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:46,518
but how closely similar is hops to

659
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,399
hemp are they like in the same

660
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:52,599
family yes of plants they're in the same

661
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:55,479
order so taxonomically uh Kingdom film

662
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:59,199
class order family so they're at the

663
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,200
same order yes

664
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,759
Ju Just to follow up on the cleanup um

665
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,720
when you use your 10% bleach on your

666
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,480
tools about how long do you do you

667
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,960
bleach for and have you validated any of

668
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,720
the timing with your PCR

669
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:18,240
assay

670
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,919
um uh let's see so far we've been really

671
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,599
we've not had any issues and it may just

672
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,519
be that I've been a virologist for so

673
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:29,158
long that um uh our materials stay

674
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,278
pretty clean just from experience

675
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,399
um we uh tend to bleach everything we

676
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:35,200
have a number of projects in the

677
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:36,879
laboratory as well so we really are

678
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,000
concerned about contamination between

679
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,720
projects and between different pathogens

680
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,038
so we do a 20-minute bleach um which is

681
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:48,360
a pretty standard um approach and then

682
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,879
everything is autoclaved for us so all

683
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:54,359
of our tools are autoclaved or

684
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:58,039
autoclavable so um yeah and since we're

685
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,558
running pcrs every day um we run enough

686
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:04,240
controls that we can pick up on things

687
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:09,200
and then we also if we feel like it we

688
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,278
will use uh 0.1 normal sodium hydroxide

689
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,720
on our lab benches which destroys any

690
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,119
nucleic

691
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,399
acid and we may do it depending upon our

692
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,759
situation I'll do that in our

693
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:21,439
centrifuges as well um I don't like to

694
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,200
use bleach in the centrifuges or some of

695
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,798
the lab equipment but put 0.1 normal or

696
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,960
0.01 normal sodium hydroxide kills

697
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:32,029
everything um without killing you or

698
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,519
damaging the

699
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:40,480
[Laughter]

700
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,480
machines so okay thank you
