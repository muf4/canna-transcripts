00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,240
canoped is one of the largest public

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,439
databases for cannabis and hemp genetic

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,199
information

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,519
in addition to being a genomics resource

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,279
to the public community canopeda is also

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,519
where medicinal genomics customers will

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,038
get access to genetic reports for

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,199
samples that they submit for either

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
sequencing or genotyping

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,519
to date there are over 1200 registered

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
strains in canapedia

12
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,959
in this video we'll walk you through the

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,518
redesigned canopedia website and

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,199
highlight some of the key features

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,519
hitting the registered strain link at

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,559
the top will bring up a list of all

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,239
publicly registered strains in canapedia

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,519
strains are presented in a session date

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,039
descending order

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,600
you can toggle the order by clicking on

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,519
the arrow next to the sort by category

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,280
you can change the sort by category to

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
either grower or name

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,280
by clicking on the sort by category

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,600
and you can also toggle the sort order

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,719
of the other categories

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
on the right-hand side of search

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,600
parameters they can be used to further

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,558
refine the results feed on the left hand

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,559
side

31
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,759
for example click the add parameter

32
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,798
button

33
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,719
scroll down to thc eight percent

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,520
enter a value of 15

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,280
and then click the update results button

36
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,118
what you'll get in the return search is

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,920
every sample in our database for which a

38
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:19,359
chemotype for thca has been submitted

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,040
and which is greater than or equal to 15

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,879
you can also toggle the directionality

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,040
of the sort order with the arrows that

42
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,280
are to the right of the sort by thc

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
percent parameter

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
parameters can also be stacked on top of

45
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,559
each other to further refine the search

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,478
for example if we want to search the

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,680
database for anything with a thc a

48
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,039
percent of greater than equal to 15

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
but also

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,960
a cbd8 percent of less than or equal to

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
5

52
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,319
we just add that as an additional

53
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,519
parameter and update the results

54
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,359
note that the results of what is

55
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,438
populated on the left hand side has

56
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,359
changed to reflect these two parameters

57
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,719
combined

58
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,200
lastly we'll add one additional

59
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,640
parameter to further refine the search

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,560
so that we have any strain name that

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,799
contains the word lion

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,640
will update the results and the two

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,840
results that are found are the two

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,520
jamaican lion samples that are in

65
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,039
canopedia one is for cancer 90 and one

66
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,879
is for whole genome sequencing and we'll

67
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,799
look at those in a little more depth

68
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,479
we'll start by taking a closer look at

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
the whole genome sequencing report for

70
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,280
jamaican lion

71
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,280
the name of strain is on top along with

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,959
the unique identifier session dinner

73
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,878
canopedia database

74
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,598
some information about the submitter

75
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,679
sample name a session date reported

76
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,759
plant sex and the sequencing or

77
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,159
genotyping technology that was used to

78
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,199
generate the genetic report we've

79
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,120
introduced a lot more search

80
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,119
functionality into kanapedia

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,959
several fields in a canopy report now

82
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,039
have an embedded hyperlink

83
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,800
if you hover over these you'll notice to

84
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,400
the right of the term a search icon

85
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
appears

86
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,719
clicking on any of these links

87
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,640
will do a database-wide search matching

88
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,719
that particular term

89
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,079
for example clicking on the medicinal

90
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,919
genomics link

91
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,120
will give us all samples where medicinal

92
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,598
genomics is the submitter

93
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,840
whereas clicking on the gender female

94
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,959
link will give us all samples in the

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,800
database

96
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,400
where the plant sex was reported as

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,400
being female by the submitter

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,039
the rarity plot shows how common your

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,439
sample is compared to all other samples

100
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,000
that have been submitted to canopedia

101
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,959
a top heavy plot indicates that a sample

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,479
is rare whereas a bottom heavy plot

103
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,479
indicates that a sample is more

104
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,519
common the next section of the canopy

105
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,280
report chemical information for the

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,439
strain is presented

107
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,519
where this information is available

108
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,439
this information is collected from the

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,439
submitter at the time of sample

110
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,439
submission

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
the genetic information section of the

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,840
report reports this plant is being a

113
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,560
type 2 plant meaning that both the thc

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,560
and cbd synthase genes are intact in the

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,400
jamaican lion genome

116
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,719
to the right of this are several files

117
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,239
available for download that represent

118
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,840
the results of the whole genome

119
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,280
sequencing that was performed on the

120
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,920
sample to generate this canopedia report

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,079
the vcf4 variant call format file

122
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,399
contains genotypes for the 800 million

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,680
plus positions in the jamaican lion

124
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,000
reference

125
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,478
the annotated vcf file contains only

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,079
genotypes which differ from the jamaican

127
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,639
line reference

128
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,240
the annotated vcf file also contains

129
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,400
annotations showing which genes

130
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,560
overlapped the variants as well as any

131
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,359
details pertaining to any protein coding

132
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,199
changes that might be present

133
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,479
fastq files contain the raw sequencing

134
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,800
reads which come out of the dna

135
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,319
sequencer while the bam files contain

136
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,319
the mapped positions of those reads to

137
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,000
the jamaican line reference and what was

138
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,918
used to generate the variant calls which

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,519
are used in the analysis in a canopy

140
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,719
report

141
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,560
the plot on the left shows the

142
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,880
heterozygosity distribution for all

143
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,240
samples in canapedia and the line shows

144
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,719
where the current sample we're viewing

145
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
the report falls on its distribution

146
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,000
since this sample is a jamaican line

147
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,159
clone it's expected to be more closely

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,240
related to the jamaican lion reference

149
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,160
and therefore has a lower heterozygosity

150
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
percentage that falls to the left of

151
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,840
this distribution curve

152
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,680
a sample that's more distantly related

153
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,079
to jamaican line will fall to the right

154
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,840
of this distribution curve

155
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,680
breeders can use this heterozygosity

156
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,279
information as a proxy for assessing

157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,959
seed line stability

158
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,359
a more stable seed line will have a

159
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,959
lower heterozygosity percentage and will

160
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,080
fall to the left of this distribution

161
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,839
curve

162
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,359
on the right hand side is the y ratio

163
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,959
distribution plot

164
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,560
scientists at medicinal genomics were

165
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,198
able to determine which regions of the

166
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,000
cannabis genome belong to chromosome y

167
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,759
by sequencing the jamaican lion father

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,038
by taking the total number of reads that

169
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,560
map to y

170
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,719
and then dividing that by the total

171
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,038
number of reads that don't map to y

172
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,960
you're able to calculate the y ratio and

173
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,879
take a distribution of this over all

174
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,038
samples in canopedia

175
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,959
the plot shows y ratio scores for two

176
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,279
separate distributions

177
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,599
in red is a population of known female

178
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,478
plants and in green is a population of

179
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,319
known male plants the line shows where

180
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,399
this sample falls in relation to these

181
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
two separate distributions

182
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,719
a line that overlaps the female

183
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,400
distribution is more likely to be female

184
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,479
and a line that overlaps the male

185
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,038
distribution further to the right would

186
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,360
be more likely to be male

187
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,360
the next section of a canopedia report

188
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
has next generation sequencing coverage

189
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,840
over key cannabinoid genes

190
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,758
the patterns of deletions in these genes

191
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,399
indicate the type of the plant

192
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,720
in type 1 plants active cbd synthase is

193
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,038
deleted and there's no next generation

194
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,919
sequencing coverage over the region

195
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:45,519
in type 2 plants active cbd synthase and

196
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,478
active thc synthase are both intact

197
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,000
and at type 3 plants active cbd synthase

198
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,560
has coverage over the region showing

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,038
that the gene is intact but active thc

200
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,199
synthase has no coverage over the region

201
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,680
suggesting that it's deleted

202
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,759
there's also a fourth type type 4 in

203
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,439
which there is neither coverage over cbd

204
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,840
synthase or active thc synthase

205
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,079
inactive cbd synthase is in close

206
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,318
proximity to the active thc synthase

207
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,079
gene is being tracked because of its

208
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,759
proximity to give a sense of the size of

209
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,598
the deletion

210
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,360
cannabichromine is another gene we track

211
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,399
in canopedia which may or may not be

212
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
deleted

213
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,679
one interesting feature of cannabi

214
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,399
chromine is that it may be responsible

215
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,759
for synthesizing thc in cases where the

216
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,758
thc synthase gene is deleted

217
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,000
this would be a good time to point out

218
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,720
the key differences between a can stamp

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,560
90 and next generation sequencing based

220
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,520
canopy report

221
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,519
a canstep 90 derived canopy report has

222
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,959
much of the same content as a sequencing

223
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,639
based report

224
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,239
the key differences are in the genetic

225
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,560
information section

226
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
note that only the annotated vcf files

227
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,038
are available for download as the other

228
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
file formats are specific to sequencing

229
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,399
technologies

230
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,319
deletions and key cannabinoid genes are

231
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,679
also presented and a plant type is

232
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,639
called based on the patterns of these

233
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,319
deletions however the nature of the data

234
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,840
necessitates that the information is

235
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,039
presented and analyzed in a different

236
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,198
way

237
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,360
each genotype called necan simp 90 chip

238
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,079
has a logo ratio score associated with

239
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,919
it

240
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,318
a deletion can be detected using these

241
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,799
log r ratio scores across multiple

242
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,720
variants in a particular region

243
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,038
the average log ratio scores were

244
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,120
calculated for samples detected as

245
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,199
having these deletions and samples

246
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,120
detected as not having them by using the

247
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,800
sequencing data

248
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,278
then the correlation of the log our

249
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,559
ratio scores and these averages was

250
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,120
calculated

251
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,679
a sample with a high correlation to the

252
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,839
average of the deleted samples likely

253
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,000
has a deletion in this region and a

254
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
sample with a low correlation likely has

255
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,159
that region intact

256
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,279
note that for canstep90 we also have

257
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,360
several y chromosome markers on the chip

258
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,000
the sex of the plan is determined using

259
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,759
the same process since a female sample

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,679
represents what a male sample would look

261
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,838
like with the y chromosome deleted

262
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,239
underneath the deletion plots is a table

263
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,720
that has the summary of deletions

264
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,560
showing the actual correlation scores

265
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
for this sample to the population that

266
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,319
has the deletion

267
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,000
and it has the actual cause whether

268
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,480
the deletion is intact or deleted and

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,399
for the plant sects whether the

270
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,399
sex of the plan is male or female

271
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,159
underneath the deletion summary are two

272
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,000
tables showing a summary of variants

273
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,519
detected in the sample

274
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,120
showing point mutations that are

275
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,519
predicted to have a moderate or high

276
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,480
impact on protein functionality and in

277
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,639
the first table we've got a thc cbd and

278
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,200
cbc synthase variants

279
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,679
underneath that is a list of variants

280
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,360
for 40 genes that are curated by

281
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,639
scientists at medicinal genomics thought

282
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,759
to play an important role in cannabis

283
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,600
genomics

284
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,600
so these would be important genes in

285
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,360
cannabis and

286
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,159
and mutations that might affect the

287
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,839
functionality of these genes

288
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,240
the variance table can be sorted on a

289
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,680
particular column using the arrows to

290
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,680
the right of the column header name

291
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,399
additionally there's a search box in the

292
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,320
top right hand corner of the table that

293
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,480
can be used to search any text contained

294
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,160
within the table and filter the results

295
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,079
based on that search

296
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,879
for example if we're looking for any

297
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,799
variants that fall on contact 700 of the

298
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,679
jamaican lion reference we simply type

299
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,399
contact 700 into the search box and we

300
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,559
only see variants on contact 700

301
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,320
likewise if we want to see only variants

302
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,599
which have a tc allele

303
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,519
we could put t

304
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
c into the search box to display only

305
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,799
those

306
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,879
a description of the gene can be

307
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,439
displayed by hovering over the gene

308
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,439
abbreviation in the gene column

309
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
there's also a unipro link which links

310
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,399
out to unipro

311
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,919
where there's more detailed information

312
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,919
describing this particular gene

313
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,320
in the next section of the canopedia

314
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,559
report we're showing you the closest

315
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
genetic genetically closest samples to

316
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,439
your sample

317
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,240
compared to everything else in our

318
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,920
database and we do this by taking a list

319
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
of high quality variants there's about

320
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,120
four thousand variants or so

321
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,679
that are

322
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,519
filtered with the high q qc values uh

323
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,000
high sequencing depth of coverage across

324
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,679
the reeds and ones that are found in the

325
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,039
population with a certain minor allele

326
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,278
frequency

327
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,958
we take those variants and calculate a

328
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,799
distance between

329
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,119
the sample and canopedia and everything

330
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,519
else in the database and then we rank

331
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
these distances to show you which are

332
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,000
the most similar and which are the least

333
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,159
similar and so on the left hand side

334
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,919
we're actually showing you uh the

335
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,879
nearest relative to jamaica jamaican

336
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,159
lion

337
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,799
uh which is the sample that we're

338
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,958
looking at in this canopy report

339
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,439
and it's based on every publicly

340
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,719
available sample in canapedia that's

341
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,839
what that's what you're viewing on the

342
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,879
left-hand side you will also see

343
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,519
any private samples which also you are

344
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,000
the owner of if you've elected to have

345
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,078
private canopy reports

346
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,799
now on the right hand side it's a little

347
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,159
different it's showing what we call the

348
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,958
base tree

349
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,879
and the base tree is a set of strains

350
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,638
that we have in our database

351
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,439
that for the purpose of calculating

352
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,480
distances we always keep the same

353
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,720
base tree and the idea was just that as

354
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839
canopedia continues to grow

355
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,759
and

356
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,440
and some of these samples that are in

357
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,159
the database will continue to grow as

358
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,079
well we'll always have that stable base

359
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,799
tree that can be used and referred back

360
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,958
to

361
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,958
and uh and can be used to compare

362
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,759
samples to one another and have that

363
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:48,159
kind of stable comparison set that we

364
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:50,159
can use as as kind of canopedia grows

365
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,240
now beneath this we have

366
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,399
the opposite collection of tables which

367
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,120
is showing you uh what is the most

368
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,078
genetically distant strain from jamaican

369
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,480
lion

370
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,638
and similarly uh what are the most

371
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,519
genetically distant ones from the base

372
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,360
tree

373
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,278
and we have these plots that show the

374
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,519
sample of interest

375
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,240
as well as kind of

376
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,759
giving you a graphical representation of

377
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,480
what are the most similar and what are

378
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:19,480
the most distant samples to your sample

379
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,278
in this final section down here we have

380
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,320
the nearest genetic relative in the

381
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,240
philos data set on the left hand side

382
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,639
and the nearest genetic relative in the

383
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,320
lynch data set on the right hand side

384
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,440
now these are two data sets that we

385
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,879
downloaded

386
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,360
from ncbi it's publicly available data

387
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,838
and it's just some additional databases

388
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,800
that we've added for comparison purposes

389
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,800
so you can look at

390
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,278
for these public data sets which sample

391
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,519
is calculated as being the closest to

392
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,838
your sample and if you click on the link

393
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,759
you'll actually be taken to ncbi

394
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,279
to that particular record for that

395
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,799
particular

396
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,399
sample set

397
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,439
and you can get additional information

398
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,879
about

399
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,440
the sample by

400
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,439
exploring these these links on ncbi

401
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,838
now at the very bottom

402
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,719
we have blockchain registration

403
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,320
information now what is this

404
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,680
what we're doing is we're taking the

405
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,920
genetic data

406
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:28,879
the vcf file i specifically we take that

407
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:32,799
and we calculate an md5 sum for it which

408
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:35,039
is a unique identifier for a particular

409
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,719
contents of a particular file

410
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,000
you can take that unique identifier

411
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,800
which is called a hash a shaw sum hash

412
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,919
and

413
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,759
encode it in a blockchain transaction

414
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,639
which is what we do

415
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,480
and so the blockchain transaction id is

416
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,759
something that is submitted to the

417
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,199
blockchain

418
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,198
you can click on it

419
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,039
and it's a decentralized database that

420
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,639
medicinal genomics does not have control

421
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,559
over and it will store your hash sum

422
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,879
in the blockchain

423
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,638
in a decentralized database so what you

424
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,000
can do is if you ever need to prove to

425
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,480
someone

426
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,720
that you had a particular strain with a

427
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,278
particular set of genotypes

428
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,440
at a particular point in time

429
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,278
you can refer them to this blockchain

430
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,040
transaction

431
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,159
and the only way

432
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,198
to get

433
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,039
that particular hash sum is using that

434
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,359
exact file

435
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,360
that was generated as part of the canopy

436
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,440
analysis that's in

437
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,879
the canopy report so someone could

438
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
download that file

439
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,639
they could do their own hash sum of the

440
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,759
file and then they could reference the

441
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,240
blockchain

442
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,399
to prove that you had that strain at a

443
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,919
particular point in time

444
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,320
we also have the details of this

445
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,759
blockchain transaction presented in this

446
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,600
pdf file

447
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,399
which could be printed out and given to

448
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,920
someone presented to them via email

449
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
etc it's just a nice way to kind of

450
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,000
summarize the whole transaction

451
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,919
this concludes the walkthrough of our

452
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
canopy redesign
