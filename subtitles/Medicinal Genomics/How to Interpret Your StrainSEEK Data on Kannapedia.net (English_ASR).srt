1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,849
all right good morning today we're gonna

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,410
go over how to interpret your DNA

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:09,000
sequencing results from a strain seek

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,740
report there's several different ways

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,779
that we sequence for clients strain seek

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,388
is one of the more popular ones this

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,429
sequence is about 3.2 million bases in

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:18,750
the cannabis genome this is different

9
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,009
than the whole genome sequencing service

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,559
we have which sequence is every base

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,570
over 800 million but the strain seek

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,788
tool is a good cheap way to get in and

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,170
get some surveying done a lot of people

14
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,500
using this for intellectual property

15
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,660
protection these if you if you actually

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,659
look into the the patent office you'll

17
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,729
see many plant patents out there that

18
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,709
have names that are actually in canopy

19
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,049
dia so it's probably the most popular

20
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,090
tool for cataloging

21
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:46,169
novel strains but it's also very helpful

22
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,700
for breeding there's lots of information

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,289
in these reports that we're gonna go

24
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,629
through that can help you through

25
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,129
breeding efforts so let's go through

26
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:54,269
some of the tools here when you do

27
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,269
sequence with us

28
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,190
the share select system from Agilent as

29
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,750
being used in this case we also have

30
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,119
some panels over developing with Arbor

31
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,670
and you'll see those shortly but this

32
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,140
sequence is 3.2 million bases in the

33
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,868
plant and it doesn't with a targeted

34
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,700
hybridization capture that can collect

35
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,280
any region of the genome and sequence it

36
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,600
and in this case we have selected around

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,640
25,000 snips that can be detected with

38
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,449
the sequencing panel but we've also

39
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,400
tiled some key genes over 926 genes have

40
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,310
variants in them that you can track as

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,710
tagged snips but we also target CBD

42
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,240
synthase THC synthase and can have a

43
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,629
chromium synthase very heavily so you

44
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,169
get full gene coverage over those genes

45
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:38,129
this means you can look for those genes

46
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,259
mutations in those genes or if those

47
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,750
genes are deleted with this tool so

48
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,129
here's an example of a sample known as

49
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,500
Blue Dream blue genes quite common and

50
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:51,810
what you can tell by this report over

51
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,909
here on the right this is a violin plot

52
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,829
that tells you how similar your strain

53
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,680
is to everything else in the database so

54
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:02,429
strains that have a lot of commonality

55
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,490
to other plants in the database have a

56
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:09,659
fairly bottom-heavy violin plot if it's

57
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:11,699
a very rare plot you will see this plot

58
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,169
change if it's a very RIF is a very very

59
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,239
strain will become more tough

60
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:17,159
you'll see more of the strains in the

61
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,810
database being very distant from your

62
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,759
strain so this is basically a density

63
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,300
plot of the strains that are in the

64
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,909
database and and the lower this gets the

65
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,650
closer it is to your strain so as this

66
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:29,969
becomes more bottom-heavy you have a

67
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,730
more common strains becomes more

68
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:34,770
top-heavy you have a more rare strain

69
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,810
some of the descriptions are right down

70
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,620
here and will pop up for you to describe

71
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,080
what these mean

72
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,640
now we collect an RSP number that's a

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,410
number that is unique in the database

74
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:48,179
and it it's unique to your cultivar and

75
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,129
we often collect other bits of

76
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,319
information that people provide it with

77
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,259
the sample submission sometimes they

78
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,399
will supply us with cannabinoid

79
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,568
interpreting information you're going to

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,400
see that in a couple reports going

81
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:01,829
forward all right so the first thing

82
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,230
that we tend to look at here is the

83
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,900
hetero zygosity plot over here this

84
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,129
tells you how different you are from the

85
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,750
reference genome the reference genome

86
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,509
that we're using here is Jamaican line

87
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,530
we have this published in a preprint

88
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:20,370
that you can view here this pre print

89
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,590
here has 42 other genomes aligned to the

90
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,599
Jamaican lion genome these are whole

91
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,530
genome sequences we also have some RNA

92
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,650
sequence in here

93
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,090
so I so seek which is RNA sequencing and

94
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,980
also some methylation data that's in

95
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,959
this paper and all of this data is also

96
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,238
in the genome browsers are known as Koji

97
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,400
which we're going to touch on in a

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,900
little bit okay so that's the reference

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,810
that we're comparing everything to and

100
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,489
your hetero zygosity is a number of

101
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,560
variants that differ from that reference

102
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,780
and we calculate those and quantitate

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,519
how heterozygous your plant is when

104
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,229
you're breeding for plants to become

105
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,090
more stable and produce more stable

106
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:57,719
seeds you want to see this green line

107
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,299
move more in this direction so does less

108
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,769
enter azygous and that's what a lot of

109
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,640
people do is they back cross to watch

110
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,509
this thing move in that direction okay

111
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,518
there's a little pop-up here that

112
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:10,590
describes a hetero zygosity as well you

113
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,789
need that and then the other most

114
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,469
important thing we're going to look at

115
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,469
is the coverage over particular genes

116
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:22,199
okay this is sequence sing read coverage

117
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,950
over what we've identified as the BTB d

118
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,310
allele

119
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,180
okay the BTB d allele at team de meyer

120
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,149
published

121
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,310
they theorized that there are regions in

122
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:35,759
the genome that dictate whether the

123
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,610
plants going to make THC or CBD okay now

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,930
so while Etienne de Meyer theorized that

125
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,300
there were markers in the genome that

126
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,970
might track with this they did not

127
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,520
actually distill down the genetic

128
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,260
locations that that might drive this and

129
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,329
so we spent a lot of time sequencing

130
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,949
many genomes to try and sort this

131
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:55,050
problem out we've got a couple preprints

132
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,569
that describe it but lo and behold

133
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,790
there's a couple ways that this actually

134
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,379
this this btv Dooley uh she operates

135
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,120
there's not a it's almost like

136
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,209
convergent evolution there's not one

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,860
solution to the problem but the vast

138
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:10,138
majority of the genotypes we see out

139
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,979
there are related to deletions of entire

140
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,478
genes okay so a couple other markers

141
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:17,189
have been described in the past on as

142
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:20,759
the BTB D allele they they don't

143
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:22,469
actually reside in the THC synthase or

144
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,089
CBD synthase genes they're close to it

145
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,320
but as a result of their distance from

146
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,759
the genes they may not be a hundred

147
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,279
percent predictive so what we've

148
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,228
switched to is actually monitoring the

149
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,389
presence and absence of these DNA

150
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:34,709
sequences that genes themselves in the

151
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,168
genome now that we have these really

152
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,879
great references we can count how many

153
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:41,069
cannabinoid synthase genes are present

154
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,418
in your genome so that's what these

155
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:44,069
plots are depicting here is they're

156
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:46,288
depending your Illumina sequence

157
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:49,469
coverage over the CBD synthase gene

158
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:51,329
that's on contig 1772 and the Jamaican

159
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,620
line reference and then it's also

160
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,949
looking at the DNA sequence coverage

161
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,680
over canting 77 41 in the Jamaican line

162
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,839
reference which has thgs and face in it

163
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,240
it also has a neighboring gene that

164
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,978
looks a lot like CBD synthase but is

165
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,168
broken okay this is what we call

166
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:08,668
inactive CBD synthase all right

167
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:10,560
this happens to be in very close

168
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,889
proximity to this and so we're only

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,139
tracking this CBDs in phase as a

170
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,650
confirmation of this marker and to also

171
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,478
try and track how large this deletion is

172
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:24,060
what we tend to see in most genomes is

173
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:27,029
full deletions of the CVD synthase gene

174
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,829
or full deletions of the THC synthase

175
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:30,659
gene and it usually embodies this

176
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:32,250
neighboring cannabinoid synthase gene as

177
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,930
well all right so this is a little bit

178
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,699
redundant this blue marker should almost

179
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,959
always correlate with this green one if

180
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,668
it doesn't you have something unique

181
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,139
where the deletion might be a partial

182
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:41,039
deletion and it's taking out just a

183
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,659
piece of this gene

184
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,220
but it's probably keema typically

185
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,320
irrelevant this is something that we're

186
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,670
just tracking to get a better size of

187
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,500
the deletion of that gene okay so this

188
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,509
is um this can be very helpful in

189
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,029
deciding whether you have type 1 2 or 3

190
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:59,069
plants now this is a complicated low

191
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:01,259
sigh there are a couple of things that

192
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,670
can go on I said can Dyson convergent

193
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,719
evolution before what does that mean

194
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,970
well that means there's a couple

195
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,350
different ways that you can kill th DS

196
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,450
in the face you can either delete the

197
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,490
entire gene or you can have point

198
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,189
mutations in the gene that knock out its

199
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,379
function the gene is still there the RNA

200
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:18,029
is probably still made however the

201
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,269
protein that gets made from that gene

202
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:23,519
does not fold a CBG into an appropriate

203
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:25,469
cannabinoid and so it's it's the gene is

204
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,379
there but it's not functional that's a

205
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:31,560
very very rare genotype we very probably

206
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,449
only three or four in the database have

207
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,740
point mutations like this and we have

208
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,829
for probably over a thousand in there

209
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,629
now so this is that's an exception and

210
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:41,219
it's also a little bit hard to predict

211
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:44,069
because sometimes those point mutations

212
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,470
aren't always in the same place they can

213
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:49,259
often be novel we see a lot of activity

214
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,520
at the 333 amino acid location and that

215
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,009
has been published in one of our pre

216
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,329
prints P 3 through 3r and there's a

217
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:56,639
couple other places we've seen hit as

218
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:58,019
well that are right now in private

219
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,680
reports and we can't speak to what those

220
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:04,319
are but they're in nevertheless when we

221
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,000
have seen variants in this gene it's

222
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,860
very rare they're the same there are

223
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,720
always seem to be somewhat private and

224
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,220
unique to two peoples cultivars which

225
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,740
means they have something novel and they

226
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,210
usually end up reporting that to an

227
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,379
electro property attorney or looking

228
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,479
into plant patents when they find

229
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:19,439
something like that so all right so

230
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,910
anyway we're gonna go through a couple

231
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,980
of these plants to show you how these

232
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,740
graphs change from type 1 2 3 and 4

233
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,689
plants ok this is blue drain you can see

234
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,449
all of its relatives here that are near

235
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:34,139
clonal distances apart and some other

236
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:36,450
ones a little bit further away now this

237
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,159
chart down here has a clone distance in

238
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,620
a sibling distance and a little fuzzy

239
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,659
area here and the reason this is fuzzy

240
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,669
is that you can't have some inbred

241
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:50,429
plants that when you cross them they

242
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:52,979
come out with siblings that blur this

243
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,569
line a little bit most siblings get

244
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,100
quite

245
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,750
if the parents are distant but the

246
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,529
parents are very similar their siblings

247
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,269
are going to come out a little bit

248
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:02,250
tighter so if you've actually have an

249
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:03,840
inbred line you may see some of the

250
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,289
siblings get closer and closer to this

251
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,930
line

252
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:08,459
likewise self plants tend to bend the

253
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:10,620
rules a little bit more this direction

254
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,389
as well so this isn't by any means a

255
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,310
hard-and-fast definition of a common

256
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:16,049
sibling it is a genetic distance score

257
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:17,489
and the better and better you get

258
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:20,519
inbreeding the more you're gonna move

259
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,350
from sibling to clone okay so that's

260
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,210
blue dream that's a clearly a type one

261
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,370
plant it's got a THC gene it doesn't

262
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,990
have a CBD gene all right let's look at

263
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,600
the original Jamaican lion plan all

264
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,639
right this is not the Jamaican lion that

265
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,450
we did the huge sequencing project on

266
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,169
after we had sequenced the Jamaican Line

267
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,879
reference and put it out there

268
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:41,129
suggesting it's a type 2 plant that

269
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,689
might predate the biotech patent the

270
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:44,730
breeder of it came forward and gave us

271
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,850
the original from 2011 and we sequenced

272
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:51,840
that as well okay now since this was the

273
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:54,930
original from 2011 it was Pro properties

274
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,420
at seven or eight years predating the

275
00:09:54,929 --> 00:10:00,209
one that we sequenced so of course it's

276
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:02,339
not identical it's not a clone but it is

277
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,650
got a very low hetero zygosity because

278
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,660
we are comparing Jeremy menorahs

279
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,029
original Jamaican line from 2011 to the

280
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:10,199
2019 descendants and of course there's

281
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,049
going to be some variation after

282
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,930
breeding and so the hetero zygosity is

283
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:18,859
way low on the charts and you can see in

284
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:21,989
here a couple of these Jamaican lions

285
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:24,360
descendants are getting very close to

286
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,190
that to the clonal distance line because

287
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,690
they are closely related to the original

288
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:32,910
genetics you'll also notice we have an

289
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,710
active CBD gene and an active THC

290
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:37,079
synthase gene alright

291
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,050
this means it's a type 2 planner again

292
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,520
this one's coming along for the ride

293
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:43,019
let's take a look at Queen Jesus Queen

294
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,990
Jesus and is an interesting one that

295
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,179
we've sequenced it has a chemo type in

296
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,639
the database and you'll notice it

297
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:53,219
doesn't make any cannabic Romijn and

298
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,629
we've also noticed is that we need to

299
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,190
add another plot here to look at the

300
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:58,470
cannabic roaming genes because we do in

301
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,750
fact cover those in your strain seek

302
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,460
report and you would find that in this

303
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,919
VCF file if you want it looked for

304
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,649
cannabic roaming there's 8 of those

305
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,028
genes on contact 7 56

306
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,409
and you can chart the coverage over

307
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:12,208
those genes to determine whether you

308
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,980
have it can have a chroming deletion and

309
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:16,768
get a plot just like this for cannabic

310
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:20,509
Romijn why do we care about can I have a

311
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:23,688
crow mean well here's a plan that makes

312
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:26,699
CBD doesn't have a THC synthase gene

313
00:11:23,688 --> 00:11:30,178
makes a little THC all right why is that

314
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:31,349
well there's couple theories and there's

315
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:34,338
good paper I'll point you to from

316
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,290
zobelle that goes over this but you can

317
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:38,819
see BD synthase and THC synthase and for

318
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:40,678
that matter c b synthase they are not

319
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:44,128
believed to be pure enzymes and that

320
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:45,240
they 100% make only one cannabinoid

321
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:49,050
they're believed to be a little

322
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,869
promiscuous in that CBD synthase for

323
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:55,139
most studies demonstrate a 23 to 1 ratio

324
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:58,139
of THC there I'm sorry of CBD to THC

325
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:00,389
synthesis that's in plants okay

326
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,899
now plants are very complicated to

327
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:05,818
measure this ratio in because plants

328
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,318
have all like 90 other genes that look

329
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:08,909
like cannabinoid synthesis that might be

330
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:10,259
contributing to this problem however

331
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:12,419
most of those look a little broken and

332
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,980
distance so the ones that we really keep

333
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:16,498
our eye on are three genes in particular

334
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,759
THC synthase CBD synthase and cannabic

335
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:19,319
row mean it's a base these are all

336
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,419
within 90% sequence identity of each

337
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:23,399
other and are likely the culprits for

338
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:28,110
making the compounds that we're dealing

339
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:31,528
with so you have a CBD synthesis gene

340
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:33,419
here it makes lots of CBD but this is

341
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:35,338
probably one of those 23 to one ratios

342
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,318
where it's leaking some TSU synthase if

343
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,629
you take CBD synthase and clone it into

344
00:12:37,318 --> 00:12:41,549
yeast and start mucking around with a pH

345
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:43,678
you'll see that it can make varying

346
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:45,719
amounts of THC synthase so the so when

347
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:47,659
the gene is taken in isolation out of

348
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,850
the plan and put into a model organism

349
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:52,769
and you ask it to give it precursor you

350
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,928
ask it to make cannabinoids it doesn't

351
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:57,448
make purely c b synthase it leaks a

352
00:12:54,928 --> 00:13:00,208
little th es and things the same thing

353
00:12:57,448 --> 00:13:03,808
is true with THC synthase if you look in

354
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:06,058
type 1 plants that don't have any CBD

355
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:08,759
synthase there's still a little bit of

356
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:12,028
residual C B's and CBD coming through

357
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:13,619
okay that's likely THC synthase being

358
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:15,899
promiscuous and making a little bit of

359
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:17,850
CBD although this one seems to be more

360
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,610
promiscuous of an enzyme than this one

361
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:23,730
we tend to see a larger ratio

362
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:27,298
of THC is CBD with with type 1 plants

363
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:30,209
then we see with CBD to THC with type 3

364
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:31,558
plants ok so this here is a type 3 plant

365
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,878
the way we know this is their sequence

366
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:34,919
coverage over the CBD gene

367
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,678
there isn't any over the THC synthesis

368
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,719
to THC synthase gene and thus

369
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:44,068
neighboring gene has gone to alright

370
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,839
let's take a look at type 4 plant what

371
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:48,208
does that look like well type 4 plants

372
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,220
like San think of 27 don't have any of

373
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:53,128
the genes so these are gonna stop and

374
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,569
make the precursor CPG now we don't the

375
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:56,938
chemo type for this but if you look at

376
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:59,219
some chemo types on line 4 type 4 plants

377
00:13:56,938 --> 00:14:01,678
you'll see even though they don't have a

378
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,548
THC gene and they don't have a CBD gene

379
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:07,198
they still make a little bit of THC and

380
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:08,730
that is largely believed right now

381
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,988
although in his hypothesis is largely

382
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,749
believed to be coming from cannabic

383
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:14,639
Romijn cannabic Romijn is is the next

384
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:16,499
closest relative to these two other

385
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,028
synthase genes which is why we're soon

386
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:20,308
going to put a little cannabic Romijn

387
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:22,230
synthase gene coverage map over here so

388
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:24,298
you can chart that as well the current

389
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,739
strain sig panel does in fact sequence

390
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:27,600
can have a chrome instant basis there's

391
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,639
eight of those genes in the genome so we

392
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,189
look at the coverage at all eight we do

393
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,889
cover all eight and you can find that in

394
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:37,738
this VCF file here if you wanted to comb

395
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,850
through the data yourself the best thing

396
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:42,360
you could do with at least if you're on

397
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,009
a Mac is hit the control button on your

398
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,709
keyboard and then click on this and

399
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:49,558
you'll get a window like this to open go

400
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:51,899
to copy link when you go to copy that

401
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:54,568
link you can then download this to your

402
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,828
Mac now the reason I'm we're gonna go

403
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:57,688
and do some terminal is if you just

404
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,698
click on that you're in a Mac it's gonna

405
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:02,099
try and download a VCF file and some

406
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:05,698
computers will auto open that file as if

407
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,139
it is a male contact file and as a

408
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,808
result of that it will probably corrupt

409
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,759
the file and you don't want to deal with

410
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:14,039
that so you can do it the old-school way

411
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,470
which is open up a terminal like this

412
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,889
type in a command called Carolla - OH

413
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:25,910
output copy and paste the link that you

414
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:28,198
just copied and down comes your file now

415
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,548
actually I'm gonna see what we have

416
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:32,099
think I already have it downloaded here

417
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:34,338
so it's giving me a bit of an error but

418
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:40,079
there's a VCF file right there so let's

419
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:42,000
let's unzip that VCF file and we can

420
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,969
start to look at what that file looks

421
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,799
like and don't want to hoping I'm gonna

422
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,259
sit because we'll be binary be a big

423
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,609
mess but if you learn more this file

424
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,610
you're gonna see a pretty big header

425
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,528
alright this tells you we embed all the

426
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,299
stuff in the VCF file because this is

427
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:05,338
the file that we hash into a blockchain

428
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:07,049
so when you do that you want to have the

429
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,389
people who send it in any of the

430
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:12,448
limiting and terpene information any of

431
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:14,850
any of the CVD information the Kol kemo

432
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:17,159
type we want to embed in the file so the

433
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,949
owner the kheema type and the genetics

434
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,889
end up in a hash in the blockchain and

435
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:23,758
then after the setter is done it's gonna

436
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:25,560
give you the length of every single

437
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,240
content that's in the assembly which is

438
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,489
a little boring but you can skip this

439
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,769
header if you just grep the file with a

440
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,448
minus V command it will skip over

441
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:34,589
anything that has these pound commands

442
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:36,419
I'll show you how to do that in a second

443
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,779
so here what you're seeing is a list of

444
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:42,059
every content that's been sequenced the

445
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:44,309
coordinate and the base and how it

446
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:47,039
differs whether it's low quality or a

447
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:48,328
passing quality and then the genotype

448
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,039
this is the important thing over here

449
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:53,189
this genotype right there is zero zero

450
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:56,519
that means it is heterozygous when you

451
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,899
see things that are zero one it means

452
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,730
I'm sorry that means it's homozygous

453
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:04,109
when you see things that are zero one it

454
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,578
means it is heterozygous okay when you

455
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,619
see dots like this it didn't have enough

456
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:11,369
coverage to make a call so there's a

457
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,928
little quality or it is right there

458
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:15,359
those are all low quality those were

459
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:17,069
passes in here are different bits of

460
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,678
information in terms of how many reads

461
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:21,209
are covering it and quality scores and

462
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,179
whatnot you can look at about what all

463
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:26,850
these little details mean if you just

464
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:28,439
look up VCF files on the internet it

465
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,889
will explain to you the file format and

466
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,900
all the other information that's encoded

467
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,669
in these comma separated forms over here

468
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,960
but this is really the critical key

469
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:38,190
because this has your genotype right

470
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,140
there that's that's the thing you want

471
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:44,370
to look for this is the coordinate and

472
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,509
we're so inside this file you're gonna

473
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:47,489
see lots of different

474
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:49,529
versions and deletions and genotypes

475
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:54,000
it's a very big file because we are

476
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:55,769
covering 3.2 million bases so let's get

477
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,309
out of that and let's do a little trick

478
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:03,119
here let's do grep grep is a tool that

479
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:04,710
will search this file and - V says give

480
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,259
me everything that doesn't match this

481
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,670
mess so I don't want to have any of the

482
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:12,539
header come through and the headers all

483
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:15,750
demarcated with two pound signs and when

484
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:18,389
you do that you'll get everything that

485
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,579
doesn't have the header file in that

486
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,170
file and it just spits out everything it

487
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,449
doesn't have that in it okay so that's

488
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,550
one way to search the file let's say we

489
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,799
want to get every variant that is on the

490
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:30,960
THC synthase contig we're gonna hit

491
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,500
we're gonna you scrub again and I happen

492
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,120
to know that that's contig 7:41 and we

493
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:41,910
want to search for every variant that's

494
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:43,799
unconscious 741 okay what we get who

495
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:47,580
doesn't have a GZ on it anymore

496
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:49,259
Oh picks up the header and then you're

497
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:51,119
gonna see it's gonna spit out a long

498
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:55,500
list of other variants that are on that

499
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:57,209
large contact alright now this is gonna

500
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,660
give you more variants that are that are

501
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,640
just in the actual genes themselves this

502
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,769
is an entire multi Megabass containg so

503
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,180
it comes out with a lot of variants in

504
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,509
fact if you typed up the word count it

505
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,250
will tell you how many give you a number

506
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:12,779
for how many variants since that word

507
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,359
count counts the number of lines so

508
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:17,129
every line is a variant in the VCF file

509
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,479
so this is just gonna come back and tell

510
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,630
you you've got X number of lines

511
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,279
therefore you've got look at that 20,000

512
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,290
variants on that contact it's a big con

513
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,019
take alright well that's too many new

514
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:33,029
ones rule let's pipe this to grep again

515
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:38,430
and let's look for only ones that are

516
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:41,389
near THC synthase and I happen to know

517
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,230
there it's for for 100 this is probably

518
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,050
that'll get us close that's in the

519
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,890
ballpark okay that's gonna give us

520
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:51,779
everything that hat that's that matches

521
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:54,330
741 then it's gonna pump it into I want

522
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:55,710
anything it's got 741 and four four one

523
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,210
seven four four one seven is a

524
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,500
coordinate that's the beginning of the

525
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,450
THC gene

526
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,839
and this is a little bit of a sloppy

527
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:07,170
search but it will still give us a

528
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:08,549
smaller list now it's gonna search for

529
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,990
that number anywhere in here and we're

530
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:12,480
gonna get some off target hits with four

531
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,519
four one seven but this is just a real

532
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:22,970
quick tutorial and where to find these

533
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:22,970
things so okay let me see

534
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,390
none of these coordinates are starting

535
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,769
at the gene so this one the sample

536
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,160
doesn't have any variants there that

537
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:33,900
might not be surprising this is in fact

538
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,029
a reference it doesn't that this

539
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,540
probably has a knock out there because I

540
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:41,430
think this is a time three plant so

541
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,019
anyway hopefully this is a helpful quick

542
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,789
tutorial on how to start surfing around

543
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,960
some of these files now this VCF file is

544
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:49,200
important to have because you can take

545
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,940
this file and load this into the coachee

546
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,620
genome browser so that you don't have to

547
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,570
manage this terminal junk and you can

548
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,250
view it in a much more user-friendly

549
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:58,289
graphical user interface so we're going

550
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,930
to touch on that in the next tutorial is

551
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:03,720
how to take your VCF file and load it

552
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:06,720
into Kouji so that you can begin to surf

553
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,829
around this information in a genome

554
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,529
browser okay so that's really step one

555
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:15,599
of using canopy dia and and what some of

556
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:19,019
these graphs mean and how to make the

557
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:21,359
most of it there is some other

558
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:23,849
information down here this is a QR code

559
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,949
which is a self referencing QR code if

560
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:29,009
you were to scan that it would go to

561
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,569
this URL that's what that QR code in

562
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:33,059
code so you can put that on a product if

563
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:35,039
you want and anyone scans it their phone

564
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,299
will bring them to this page this is

565
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,430
some of the blocks block chaining

566
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,200
certificates so this this is what you

567
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,930
need if we ever disappear or go out of

568
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,970
business your data is still circulating

569
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,250
on block chains alright and you can

570
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,620
click on these things and get proof of

571
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,420
your data's existence again it's not

572
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:53,159
putting this huge file under watch-chain

573
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,460
it's too big to go into a block chain it

574
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,320
is putting a PDF or as I'm sorry it's

575
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,180
putting a hash of your data into the

576
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,189
blockchain which is this short signature

577
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,870
this signature represents your data if

578
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,150
you change one letter in that file this

579
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:07,949
whole hash changes so this is such a

580
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,690
unique number that it only can represent

581
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,179
your file and if you can demonstrate

582
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,249
that this number exists in a time

583
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:16,320
dammt blockchain transaction you can

584
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,548
prove the date of your file change one

585
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,928
letter in the file this whole thing

586
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:21,148
scrambles so you can also prove that

587
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:22,950
it's not been been mucked with since the

588
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:25,018
date it's been generated all right it's

589
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,720
not been edited all right this is a kind

590
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:32,159
of what we call proof of existence we do

591
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,019
scan NCBI for other validated datasets

592
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,539
now I'm putting validated and air quotes

593
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,609
here because these were generated with

594
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:41,339
really early technologies before we had

595
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:42,778
good references and it's very rare we

596
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:44,759
get perfect overlaps because there are

597
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,950
DNA sequencing errors and these datasets

598
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,610
however if we saw something that was

599
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,899
maybe 78 or 80 out of 81 snips that were

600
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:53,758
overlapping in the file set that's

601
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:55,199
probably a perfect match but you might

602
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,720
need some confirmation sequencing to

603
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,808
confirm it the techniques that were used

604
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,879
here again predated people understanding

605
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:04,950
that there's a snip every 50 bases in

606
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:07,319
cannabis and so they use techniques that

607
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,419
would trip up on those other variants

608
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,668
and not always amplify targets out of

609
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,139
the genome accurately so we don't expect

610
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:14,519
to get a hundred percent overlap in

611
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:17,428
concordance with these other techniques

612
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:21,480
because they were operating with earlier

613
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:27,320
tools so okay with that we are gonna go

614
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,319
on to section 2 of this tutorial Thanks
