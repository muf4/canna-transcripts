conflict you can view our full refund

website Kemet events comm we have a

59
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:48,770
great episode for you today I had a

60
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,709
conversation with Martin Haley the

61
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:54,709
co-founder and director of project CBD

62
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:57,140
in addition to creating content for the

63
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,479
project CBD website and speaking at

64
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:02,119
conferences around the globe Martin has

65
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,729
authored several books including smoke

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,659
signals a social history of marijuana

67
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:10,819
medical recreational and scientific it's

68
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:13,520
a great read we actually have a copy in

69
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:16,810
our office Martin and I discussed the

70
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,070
topic everyone is talking about covin 19

71
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,469
Martin has reviewed the scientific

72
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:23,959
literature to find out whether CBD can

73
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:26,840
calm the cytokine storm that the kovat

74
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,810
virus can set off whether CBD has

75
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,229
antiviral properties and if cannabis is

76
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:36,019
an immune booster suppressant or both as

77
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:39,169
you can imagine where the virus as new

78
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,750
and novel as kovat 19 and a federal ban

79
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:44,509
on cannabis the research is far from

80
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,629
conclusive but i think you will see

81
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:50,419
there is some potential in some areas

82
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:52,639
that merit future research who knows

83
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:56,208
maybe you will see some compelling data

84
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,039
at a future can med event before I get

85
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,000
to my conversation we are proud to have

86
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,919

[Music]

95
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,680
good afternoon Martens thanks for

96
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,490
joining us

97
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,110
my pleasure yeah I just want to thank

98
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,389
you again for for taking the time to

99
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,370
join us during what I imagine must be a

100
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,620
hectic time for you and your family I

101
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,410
know you were personally affected by the

102
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:49,030
cove in nineteen pandemic so first how

103
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:51,180
are you and your wife doing well I'm not

104
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:54,459
showing any symptoms but my wife did

105
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,379
what was infected and she's now just out

106
00:04:54,459 --> 00:05:01,538
of quarantine so she had a relatively

107
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:03,939
mild case of the Koba 19 virus and you

108
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:05,649
know as you know it's not always mild it

109
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:08,709
can be sometimes fatal but there's a

110
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:10,929
spectrum of symptoms and you know we're

111
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,609
obviously interested in how cannabis in

112
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:16,689
general and see meeting that particular

113
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,979
might affect that entire spectrum yeah

114
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:19,990
absolutely that's one of the main

115
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:22,930
reasons I wanted to to talk to you today

116
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,139
I did see the article that you published

117
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:29,949
on project CBD about just this sort of

118
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:33,460
the the interaction between Koba 19 CBD

119
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:35,620
and cannabinoids and I must admit I've

120
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,138
seen a lot of articles out there sort of

121
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,639
trying to tackle this issue and I'll be

122
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,530
honest a lot of them I've sort of tuned

123
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,348
out because they make a lot of old

124
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:46,119
claims but I was I was very happy to see

125
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:49,569
that yours was very well reasoned and

126
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,449
well researched so first kind of what

127
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:56,918
prompted you to want to write this

128
00:05:52,449 --> 00:06:00,250
article well I should say initially you

129
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:02,348
know what one when you consider the

130
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,110
therapeutic promise and potential of CVD

131
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:06,610
in particular in cannabis you know

132
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,158
there's an awful lot there and one does

133
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,960
not need to exaggerate an overstate and

134
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:12,848
I do think there's a lot of exaggeration

135
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,339
and assumption and overstatements

136
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:18,339
happening with respect to you know

137
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:22,119
cannabis and CBD and the hand emic that

138
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:24,939
we're experiencing Mallon obviously we

139
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,680
felt it was important to address this

140
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:28,750
issue because it's the burning issue of

141
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,168
the day and there is a lot of confusion

142
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,930
a lot of people do use cannabis for

143
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:37,180
therapeutic purposes or otherwise an

144
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,848
obvious question is how will that usage

145
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,829
impact the virus over the course of the

146
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:44,829
virus their exposure

147
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:46,629
and you know our symptoms if for one Gus

148
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:47,829
come down with it so you know it's an

149
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:53,079
important issue because of what's

150
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:55,479
happening today and so in reading

151
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,930
through the article it seems like one of

152
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,670
the primary things that you tackled was

153
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,620
looking at whether cannabis or CBD

154
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,960
specifically can kind of calm this

155
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,959
cytokine storm I hope I'm pronouncing

156
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,419
that correctly first can you explain

157
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:15,089
what exactly that is and why it's

158
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:19,780
dangerous well you know the most severe

159
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:21,789
reaction to the köppen 19 virus involves

160
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:25,000
what scientists refer to as a cytokine

161
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:28,120
storm syndrome in The Lancet the eminent

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,860
British Journal they drew attention to

163
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,889
the fact that the evidence indicates

164
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,850
that people dying of this disease are

165
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:40,149
experiencing what they refer to as a

166
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,590
cytokine storm and and in essence it's

167
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:43,149
not the virus that's killing people

168
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:47,519
because if that were the case then

169
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:50,079
anyone exposed would die what is

170
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,990
resulting in mortality is is how the

171
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:57,189
body reacts to the bias and in extreme

172
00:07:52,990 --> 00:08:00,160
cases there is an intense immune

173
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:02,889
overreaction in the lungs and that's

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,420
what can actually kill someone or sick

175
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:10,089
and one to a very significant degree so

176
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,860
ultimately it involves a respiratory

177
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,399
distress which is the leading cause of

178
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,980
death with the Cova 90 cases so

179
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:21,250
basically it's an intense autoimmune

180
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:24,129
reaction to the virus and that's what

181
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:27,600
the cytokine storm syndrome is and

182
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:31,360
because it's so in autoimmune or immune

183
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:35,139
overreaction it raises the question well

184
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,450
what can what can be done to treat this

185
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:41,669
and so you need something that's going

186
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:44,560
to suppress the immune system and

187
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:47,740
cannabis could do that cannabis and CBD

188
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:50,619
in particular but also THC notoriously

189
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,419
have immunosuppressant effects and

190
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,710
that's the reason why cannabis can be

191
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:55,360
very effective for people with

192
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,450
autoimmune diseases of which there are

193
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,789
many different kinds autoimmune disease

194
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:07,090
when when the body over reacts to when

195
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:10,269
the immune system over reacts to I'd say

196
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:14,050
a misperceive threat in autoimmune

197
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:15,730
condition can result and cannabis could

198
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:18,759
be very effective for that so it raises

199
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,470
the question well if the Koba 19 virus

200
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:25,840
in the most extreme form of the disease

201
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:28,300
is an intense immune response might

202
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,280
cannabis or might CBD and particular be

203
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:33,250
helpful in that regard that the problem

204
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:35,500
is we really don't know this hasn't been

205
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,350
any test in this regard but

206
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,289
theoretically you can posit that the

207
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:47,230
autoimmune or the anti-inflammatory

208
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:48,909
aspect of CBD of M THC potentially if it

209
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,590
could be harnessed might be a treatment

210
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:52,899
down the road for something like this

211
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,000
but the evidence at this point is

212
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,709
fragmentary and sketchy but it is

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,929
compelling that there really ought to be

214
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,320
research in this area unfortunately we

215
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:04,979
don't have that research to date so with

216
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,570
cytokines specifically so how do

217
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,340
cannabinoids sort of interact with them

218
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,440
or even endocannabinoids

219
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,440
how does that all kind of work together

220
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,279
well these cytokines they're really a

221
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:20,769
group of proteins that regulate

222
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,389
inflammatory responses that disease is

223
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,279
an infection and they're secreted by

224
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,720
immune cells the cytokines

225
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,529
cytokine could be either

226
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,960
pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory

227
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:35,079
typically it's a pro-inflammatory

228
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,500
messenger an example would be the tumor

229
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:41,410
necrosis factor-alpha that that's a

230
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,809
cytokine that's produced in excess in

231
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:46,049
cases of rheumatoid arthritis which is

232
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:49,179
another very painful autoimmune disease

233
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:50,979
it flicks more than a million people in

234
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:54,879
the United States that's condition so

235
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,889
what what cannabis could do is it can

236
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,919
suppress the inflammation

237
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,659
in various different ways there one of

238
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,049
the cannabinoid receptors as you may

239
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:07,069
know that there's two cb1 and cb2 the

240
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:10,069
cb2 receptor

241
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:13,720
is present in immune cells and when that

242
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:17,330
is activated by THC or in other ways

243
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,370
that will confer in Ottawa I would say

244
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:24,980
an anti inflammatory response

245
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:27,230
so CBD doesn't directly activate the cb2

246
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,960
receptor but it seems to do so

247
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,240
indirectly or it has many effects that

248
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,730
are parallel or similar to activation of

249
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,850
the secretory sector both CBD and THC

250
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,509
are very potent anti-inflammatory so

251
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,940
when you have a pro-inflammatory

252
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:45,649
expression of the cytokines this is

253
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,520
something that could be helpful and

254
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,679
there of course there are other things

255
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,919
like corticosteroids and so in this is

256
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,789
how steroids operate as

257
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,659
anti-inflammatories they've their

258
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:58,429
appropriate perhaps for acute

259
00:11:55,659 --> 00:12:02,870
inflammatory flare-ups but unfortunately

260
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:04,939
in cases of the cytokine storm that is

261
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,289
not always the case with corticosteroids

262
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,240
because they could be harmful in their

263
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:09,769
own right to the lungs and in the lungs

264
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,129
is that you know the focus of the

265
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:14,919
disease so I think scientists are

266
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:17,059
looking for other options other than

267
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:20,149
corticosteroids to treat a cytokine

268
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:23,269
storm syndrome and again it might be

269
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,100
down the road that CBD or other

270
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:27,279
cannabinoids could be developed in this

271
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:31,100
way but we're not there yet

272
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,009
yeah is another example of they're just

273
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,230
not being enough research it seems at

274
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:38,240
this point yes exactly and you can

275
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,250
credit that to federal prohibition that

276
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,220
has really been a major obstacle to

277
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:50,059
research and we seem bitter fruit of

278
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,070
that but hopefully that will shift in

279
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:53,419
the future yeah hopefully some

280
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,370
researchers will kind of take up that

281
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:57,589
mantle and and start doing that research

282
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,350
we'd love to see that presented it can

283
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:03,620
med one of these years another thing he

284
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:06,200
got into in don't go ahead please I was

285
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:11,389
going to add if I could you really there

286
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:13,580
is a compelling is a compelling scenario

287
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:17,840
to justify this kind of research because

288
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,910
the CBD at pure CBD single molecule CVD

289
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,379
something like EMA dialects for example

290
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:24,519
which is

291
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:27,549
prescribed for epileptics CBD is now

292
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,759
being tested and showing some degree of

293
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:33,279
success for what's what's called

294
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:36,279
graft-versus-host host disease which is

295
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,399
also an extreme autoimmune reaction it

296
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:43,629
happens when someone receives an organ

297
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,949
transplant and rejects the organ that

298
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:46,350
often can be fatal

299
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,780
that rejection it's called a

300
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:53,680
graft-versus-host disease it's usually

301
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:56,259
fatal in 80% of the cases and there's

302
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,729
really no treatment for it but CBD

303
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:00,879
because it is a very potent

304
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,590
anti-inflammatory is now being looked at

305
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,580
there's a clinical trial in Israel

306
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:07,780
that's ongoing as a treatment for

307
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,730
graft-versus-host disease and there is a

308
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,919
parallel there because both Graham

309
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,039
versus host disease and and the cytokine

310
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:19,360
storm associated with extreme reactions

311
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:23,860
to the Cova virus they are both

312
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,690
autoimmune reactions but it's important

313
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,450
to keep in mind that with the Cova 19:00

314
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,800
virus it's a virus induced phenomenon

315
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,910
whereas with the graft-versus-host

316
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:36,669
disease it is not virally induced but

317
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:38,949
there is some you know some reason to be

318
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:41,370
hopeful that if that CBD could be

319
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:45,460
harnessed its therapeutic potential for

320
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:48,129
in both of these situations well I think

321
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,200
that's a good a good segue because

322
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:52,450
another thing that the article got into

323
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,090
was sort of looking at whether CBD can

324
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:58,860
actually be used as an anti viral agent

325
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:01,660
so what does the research say about that

326
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,090
well there's there's some hints of that

327
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:05,949
there's not a lot of research that shows

328
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:10,840
this but a little bit you know there

329
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:14,560
there's there was one study that showed

330
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:18,009
or sillies suggested that CBD had ant

331
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:20,979
direct antiviral effect against hippest

332
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:23,169
hepatitis C virus but this was only a

333
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,480
one preclinical study and there's really

334
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:29,039
nothing else that's see that shows that

335
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,210
CBD has this direct antiviral properties

336
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,819
what it does show though in certain

337
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:37,269
situations

338
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:42,180
you know virally induced diseases can

339
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:46,269
have can be expressed in terms of

340
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:48,009
inflammation and the CBD can temper the

341
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:50,110
inflammation of the viral induced

342
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:52,480
disease without necessarily directly

343
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,950
affecting the virus itself so that's a

344
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,899
possibility and there are several

345
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:59,410
studies that suggest that

346
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,629
so as for direct viral antiviral

347
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:03,639
activity there's not a lot out there but

348
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:06,419
in terms of reducing the inflammation

349
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:12,009
associated with a viral induced disease

350
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:14,559
that's quite possible and what about

351
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:17,049
just kind of having an optimized

352
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,359
endocannabinoids system does that sort

353
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:23,349
of help an individual be able to fight

354
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,149
off a viral infection well it's a little

355
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,580
tricky you know at project CBD we've

356
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,409
gotten a lot of emails people asking

357
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,540
questions and sometimes complaining that

358
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:34,089
we haven't put out stern warnings

359
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:37,089
against people taking cannabis during

360
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:41,259
this period the suggestion being because

361
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:44,110
CBD is immunosuppressive typically it's

362
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:46,870
not might not be a good idea to be

363
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,909
consuming to CBD you th see you cannabis

364
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,960
at the present time because it might

365
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:54,219
make one more susceptible to the virus

366
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,840
there's no indication that that's

367
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,820
actually the case but there are some

368
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,259
concerns and I think when we talk about

369
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,509
the endocannabinoid system and the

370
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:06,640
immune system and and it's a little

371
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:08,680
tricky because it's not like a one-way

372
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,610
street it's not that simply in the

373
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,850
cannabinoid system will have a

374
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:19,109
suppressive effect against u-neck immune

375
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,188
activity it could again when there is a

376
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:23,619
overreaction of the immune system and

377
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,689
cannabinoids a systems job is you might

378
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:28,208
say it is to temper that almost like a

379
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,090
dimmer switch to turn down overactive

380
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:35,230
immune activity but in a normal

381
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:37,899
situation that doesn't seem to be the

382
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:41,529
case that that's happening it's in a

383
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:47,320
situation where one one is not dealing

384
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:47,829
with in a autoimmune disease it doesn't

385
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,048
seem

386
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:52,569
that cannabis or cannabinoids such as

387
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:55,089
CBD and THC has a negative effect on the

388
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:57,579
immune system if anything it might be

389
00:17:55,089 --> 00:18:01,538
the opposite case it might help the end

390
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:05,408
of cannabinoid system for the tone to do

391
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:07,898
its job as a Tana fire and and rather

392
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:11,850
than just suppressing immune activity

393
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:15,099
it seems that evidence suggests now that

394
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:17,319
the cannabinoids have an you know

395
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:20,528
modulating effect which could entail

396
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:23,048
suppressing immune activity when that's

397
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:24,819
important to do but otherwise just sort

398
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:27,069
of maintaining things and keeping things

399
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:30,009
at a healthy level so you can look at it

400
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:31,869
this way when when one has a fever to

401
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:34,960
fight it and that's necessary to fight

402
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:37,089
an infection the endocannabinoid system

403
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,769
doesn't turn down the fever doesn't turn

404
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:40,959
down the anti inflammatory response

405
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:43,089
until it's okay to do so it it's more

406
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,370
like it steps out of the way and it gets

407
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,898
out of the way so that the immune system

408
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:48,609
can do its thing and fight off the

409
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:51,129
infection but in a healthy situation

410
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,329
it's just simply there helping to

411
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,760
modulate helping to boost

412
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:56,288
endocannabinoids own so that the

413
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,450
endocannabinoids system does its job

414
00:18:56,288 --> 00:19:01,329
well then that seems to be the case so

415
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,519
it can really go either way and when you

416
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:06,788
always talk about immunomodulation

417
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,159
again it could be suppressive or could

418
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:12,700
be allowing the immune system to act as

419
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:16,149
it needs to there is there was one study

420
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,730
of the AIDS of the HIV virus that

421
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:21,428
suggested that cannabis consumption can

422
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,230
actually boost immune activity in that

423
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:25,960
regard which would be helpful when when

424
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,808
dealing with AIDS or HIV infection so

425
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,579
that underscores how with cannabinoids

426
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:33,038
if they can go in two directions that

427
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:35,888
the endocannabinoid system is sort of

428
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:41,048
operates in a bi-directional way it can

429
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:44,558
calm an overexcited nervous system or it

430
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:46,599
can boost a situation with this less

431
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,609
energy than needed because the

432
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:52,349
endocannabinoid system will modulate

433
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:55,148
both glutamate which is an excitatory

434
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:57,069
neurotransmitter so again will as a

435
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:58,979
dimmer switch using that analogy will

436
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:04,450
kind of toned down

437
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:06,009
excitation but if if one's imbalance is

438
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,350
in the other direction and one is too

439
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,410
sluggish if maybe the gaba is more

440
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:13,089
prominent which is a depressive

441
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,759
neurotransmitter the endocannabinoids

442
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:18,099
system can slow down gaba meaning can

443
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,470
speed things up overall in the system so

444
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:24,459
it underscores how it operates in a

445
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:26,740
bi-directional capacity and a CBD and

446
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,509
THC since they're operating through the

447
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,490
endocannabinoid system whether directly

448
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:32,230
or indirectly we'll also have a

449
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,089
bi-directional effect and that will

450
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,910
apply to the immune system as well so it

451
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:39,459
can really it can move things in either

452
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,500
direction and hopefully it will do so

453
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,319
you know when it's necessary in the

454
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:47,349
healthy way so coming back to the

455
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:50,079
question should be to one be consuming

456
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:51,819
cannabis at this time you know I'm not a

457
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,428
doctor I couldn't really say I don't

458
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:57,339
know that it would be harmful if one is

459
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:58,740
not affected with the disease but one

460
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,970
should keep in mind that it is

461
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,980
immunosuppressive and I think that's

462
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,039
reflected actually now in the sales of

463
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:09,549
cannabis products and CBD products well

464
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,769
CBD products of which has been a they've

465
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:13,240
been driving the sort of a natural

466
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:15,420
supplement market it's been the biggest

467
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,200
seller for the last couple of years

468
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:23,019
since the virus the pandemic has erupted

469
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,150
of anything it seems that the sales are

470
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:27,789
slowing down of CBD products and people

471
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,860
are turning to other supplements that

472
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:33,369
are known specifically to boost immune

473
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:35,909
function whereas CBD as sort of a Depot

474
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:38,049
up mode we tend to be you know

475
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,850
immunosuppressive in most situations but

476
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:42,970
not always so it's a really it's tricky

477
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:45,579
and it's tricky because the virus itself

478
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,170
and how the disease expresses you know

479
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:49,178
it's different at different phases so

480
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,100
what might be helpful at one phase of

481
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:55,380
the disease might be harmful at another

482
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:56,529
phase if you need to boost immune

483
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,170
response

484
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:01,808
you know maybe cannabis and CBD and THC

485
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,029
wouldn't be the best things if you need

486
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:07,629
to suppress immune response well that

487
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:09,730
could be ideal but when you're talking

488
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,740
about it the phase of the disease that's

489
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,329
most critical the cytokine storm

490
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,769
syndrome

491
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:19,278
you know you're talking about an intense

492
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:22,669
immune response an intense inflammatory

493
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:25,099
response where in these situations an

494
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:27,350
anti-inflammatory compound like CBD or

495
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:29,868
THC a cannabis in general might

496
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:31,428
conceivably be helpful but but it's

497
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:33,319
really tricky because in these

498
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:36,769
situations we're dealing with a cytokine

499
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:38,599
storm I imagine that if if the

500
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:40,220
cannabinoid could actually be effective

501
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,189
in this situation who probably need a

502
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,139
pretty high dose and high doses of

503
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,278
cannabinoids tend to have the opposite

504
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:50,658
effect of lower doses or low doses are

505
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:53,868
immunosuppressive may be very very high

506
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:56,690
doses would be just the opposite which

507
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:59,480
is what you wouldn't be in a cytokine

508
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,610
storm syndrome situation but then again

509
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,889
you know cannabinoids which have been

510
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:05,449
often been described as biphasic meaning

511
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:08,058
you know low doses have a certain

512
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,159
response high doses have an opposite

513
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:11,690
effect it might be that when you're

514
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,600
dealing with something like a cytokine

515
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,470
storm syndrome you can get entering a

516
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:22,118
sort of a triphasic realm where a really

517
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:25,999
high dose of a cannabinoid such as CBD

518
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:27,859
could could not simply have an opposite

519
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:30,139
effect of a low dose but would be almost

520
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:32,089
amplifying what a low dose would do it

521
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:34,308
so it's very complicated and we really

522
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:36,138
don't know and one shouldn't be cavalier

523
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:37,970
about these things and make you know

524
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:40,699
statements as if one one could be

525
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,259
certain about what what would happen but

526
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,710
one should emphasize that we don't know

527
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:48,579
at least in terms of exposure you know

528
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:52,788
short of dealing with the cytokine storm

529
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:55,368
that that it would be harmful either so

530
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:56,960
I think you know one has to be careful

531
00:23:55,368 --> 00:24:00,398
about these thing and has to use their

532
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,200
own judgment ultimately at this point

533
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:05,329
yeah I agree and I think it's

534
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,100
interesting at least to look at the

535
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:09,288
mechanisms look at what's actually going

536
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:12,230
on with these conditions and then sort

537
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:13,970
of look to see what what CBD or the

538
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,589
different cannabinoids what effect they

539
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,440
have on the system and just sort of try

540
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:20,058
to draw some parallels and say like you

541
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,740
like you've been saying this whole time

542
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,829
and you say in your article there's

543
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,849
potential here but we just don't know

544
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,519
and I think there's a lot of value in

545
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:29,009
that at Lee

546
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,839
to sort of explore whether or not it's a

547
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,849
possibility and then of course we could

548
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,159
take the next step and actually do the

549
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:36,689
research but I got to imagine that there

550
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,880
must be tough to do that in a situation

551
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,610
like a cytokine storm because it's you

552
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,340
know a very dangerous situation that is

553
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:46,740
probably being treated with a number of

554
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:49,079
different drugs to really sort of

555
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,910
isolate what's doing what must be very

556
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:52,740
difficult well I think obviously you

557
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:55,050
have to go through step by step process

558
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,380
and preclinical research involving

559
00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:00,539
animal models would be necessary here

560
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,700
but all right you know there is some

561
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:04,769
there's enough information out there

562
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,750
that's can make a compelling case that

563
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,519
this should be explored that the one

564
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,170
should explore this direction and it's

565
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:11,639
so much criminal that hasn't happened up

566
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:14,610
until this point because it's not like

567
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,860
sauna kind storms is something that we

568
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:19,589
only learn about recently it's been

569
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:23,699
implicated in a century ago in the

570
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:26,579
Spanish flu pandemic it's thought that

571
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,670
the deaths resulted in or in that

572
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:32,789
pandemic 50 million people died

573
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:38,670
worldwide earth this is 1918 1920 during

574
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:41,389
that period it's it's lost my train of

575
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:43,560
thought there a little bit it decided

576
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,480
scientists have known about cytokines

577
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:48,319
and cytokine storm syndrome for some

578
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,549
time when no one was really

579
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:54,869
investigating whether cannabinoids could

580
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:56,519
be a treatment in this regard sure and

581
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:59,549
this can happen with the the normal

582
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,990
annual flu as well right yeah but

583
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:03,139
usually that doesn't result in a

584
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,039
cytokine storm that kind of extreme

585
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,450
overreaction like you know things you're

586
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,000
obviously dangerous and they could be

587
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:12,960
fatal and what's kind of an interesting

588
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,440
analogy here is that the when one looks

589
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:21,269
at what when one compares the the

590
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:25,289
expression of lung disease in people who

591
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:29,339
have died because of if they been poor

592
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:32,269
products for cannabis oil products or

593
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:35,129
CBD oil products the unlicensed products

594
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:38,269
typically what the symptom ology shows

595
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:41,670
what's referred to as ground-glass

596
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:43,559
opacities in the lungs it looks like the

597
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:47,820
lungs like they're filled with ground

598
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:51,210
glass and similarly that shows up in

599
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:54,329
cytokine storms that symptom ology is

600
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,740
described as ground glass acid passages

601
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:58,470
in the lungs

602
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,620
so the immuno both the vaping disease

603
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:05,690
and in the cope in nineteen are lung

604
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:08,519
diseases died from respiratory failure

605
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,650
so that's is something worth looking out

606
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,829
there as well so I wouldn't suggest

607
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:16,680
vaping unlicensed products now to deal

608
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:20,039
during this period that that in general

609
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:22,500
one should avoid those but when we

610
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,250
talking about immune over reactions and

611
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,339
people dying from the immune system

612
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:31,230
rejecting what's going on in the lungs

613
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:34,889
there is a similarity between the baby

614
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,360
don't miss we saw past summer and what

615
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:41,910
we're seeing today with the cytokine

616
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:44,789
storms yeah and I meant to meant to ask

617
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,490
you about that obviously there's a

618
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:50,129
number of different ways that you can

619
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:52,109
consume cannabis and sort of in the

620
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,820
current state of you know there being

621
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:56,369
the potential for a covert infection

622
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:59,579
would someone who regularly smokes

623
00:27:56,369 --> 00:28:03,059
cannabis or vapes are they at any higher

624
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:05,669
risk of kind of having a negative

625
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,919
response should they actually contract

626
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:12,240
kovat like are they kind of setting

627
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:14,550
themselves up for for a bad time it's a

628
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,079
better term it's a very good question

629
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:18,269
and it's something that's been discussed

630
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,329
a little bit in Canada stresses it but

631
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:23,309
the problem here is for so long the

632
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:28,319
authorities had been crying wolf about

633
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:31,589
cannabis and and making claims of harm

634
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:35,309
that that are either exaggerated or

635
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:37,109
fabricated so at this point now then

636
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:38,819
we'll get hearing warnings from doctors

637
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:41,879
and officials Oh smoking marijuana

638
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:44,279
smoking cannabis could harm the lungs of

639
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,550
making more susceptible to copa90 more

640
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:49,889
exacerbated if one is exposed you know

641
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:51,750
it's the cry phenomenon that we've heard

642
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,090
people people ignore it

643
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,890
there's been relaxing creative work just

644
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:58,189
so much about cannabis that's

645
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,600
been said and that's unfortunate because

646
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,640
frankly at this point anything that that

647
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:04,379
weakens the lungs that irritates the

648
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,770
lungs and that would include tobacco

649
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,760
smoking or just air pollution which is a

650
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:14,279
more serious problem than air pollution

651
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,869
that that's a risk factor and people

652
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:18,210
should recognize that so yes obviously

653
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:19,739
better than VAP if you're using a good

654
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,720
product than to smoke it's less

655
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,120
irritating or obviously better to

656
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,569
consume cannabis in other ways you can

657
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:32,250
ingest edibles or drink beverages and so

658
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:35,579
forth it's probably wise to do that in

659
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:37,410
general lung health you know could be

660
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:39,029
supplemented by jogging a little bit

661
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,890
each day just doing things to stay

662
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:43,139
healthy I mean cannabis in general

663
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,759
should be or it's best used as part of a

664
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,530
healthy lifestyle and that that's

665
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:49,049
underscored that message should be

666
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:55,019
underscored and in the current moment

667
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:58,500
given what we're doing yeah and one of

668
00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:00,869
the things that we're sort of trying to

669
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,809
consider trying to look into is what

670
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:06,809
about cannabis itself being infected

671
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:08,429
with kovat 19 you know us at medicinal

672
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:10,669
genomics we do a lot of work in

673
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:13,440
microbial safety testing so looking for

674
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:16,680
different molds different bacteria that

675
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,930
might be infecting cannabis and you know

676
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,490
bat guano is sometimes used as a plant

677
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:26,190
fertilizer and could that potentially be

678
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:27,870
infecting the plant in some way probably

679
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,910
unlikely but I guess it's something

680
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:32,429
worth considering yeah you know it's

681
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,390
very in the nd stuff yeah it's very

682
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,100
interesting that you should bring that

683
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,780
up of that back one I really never

684
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,240
thought of it I know that back on I was

685
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:41,819
considered an excellent supplement for

686
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,740
fertilizing plants and so forth

687
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:47,299
generally well I think it is quite safe

688
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:51,589
organic not chemical and so forth but

689
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:53,519
it's worth an worth researching I think

690
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:56,279
medicinal genomics is probably

691
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,220
well-positioned to do that i through a

692
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,589
genomic research I think one could

693
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,048
identify a virus in a plant

694
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:06,298
and so they can kind of find mold and

695
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:06,720
other things so that would be really

696
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,480
great

697
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,788
one could look into that and but you

698
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,079
know we're also dealing with what was at

699
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:14,990
least initially as somewhat of a

700
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,908
localized phenomenon thought to be

701
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,460
originating in China so one couldn't one

702
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:22,679
shouldn't assume and that if indeed

703
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,710
there was a transfer from bats to humans

704
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,730
that might have sparked this crisis that

705
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:32,370
that would also be the case that guano

706
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:34,048
essence that's used as a supplement for

707
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,369
cannabis cultivation because we're

708
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:37,408
talking about different areas of the

709
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:39,629
world but definitely worth considering

710
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:44,940
and looking into it's an it's an

711
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:46,799
intriguing notion absolutely and one of

712
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,870
the other things that you had gotten

713
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:52,648
into sort of in the later parts of your

714
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:54,449
article was sort of just the the current

715
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:56,939
situation that we're in with the the

716
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,730
cannabis industry and how but certain

717
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,710
restrictions might be actually putting

718
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:03,298
folks in the industry at higher risk and

719
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:05,669
one of the things that you pointed out

720
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:07,798
was that banking restrictions mean that

721
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:10,288
dispensaries have to deal in cash which

722
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:12,538
exposes them more to the virus than if

723
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:13,859
you were say using a debit card or

724
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:15,990
something like that I thought that was a

725
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:17,398
very interesting thing to point out I

726
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,980
don't know if you want to expand it

727
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,259
that's not just yeah I mean it's not

728
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,149
just the cannabis workers so people in

729
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,558
the industry which is well it's tax

730
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:28,139
collectors because people have

731
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:30,389
businesses pay their taxes in in cash

732
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,820
and literally wheelbarrows of cash are

733
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,559
brought over to the appropriate places

734
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,869
you know every quarter where you have to

735
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,369
pay their quarterly attacks and that's

736
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:40,019
just the absurd situation we're in

737
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:43,469
because cannabis is caught between

738
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:45,418
betwixt in between you know legal being

739
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,759
legal on a state level certainly at

740
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:50,669
least in the state like California or

741
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,710
Massachusetts for that matter in many

742
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:54,840
other states but the federal law is

743
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:57,079
federal law and banking privileges are

744
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,699
not extended to cannabis businesses

745
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:02,220
hopefully that will change perhaps in

746
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,700
the near future but it's just another

747
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:08,399
way that prohibition federal prohibition

748
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,200
is is dangerous and contributes to the

749
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,579
the problems that we're having today

750
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,039
it's not just simply that federal

751
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:16,339
prohibition is blocked

752
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:19,009
we don't really know to what extent CBD

753
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:21,349
or cannabis can have an antiviral effect

754
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:23,210
which would be really nice to know now

755
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:26,959
we don't know that because a federal

756
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,670
prohibition and we also are consigned to

757
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,190
dealing with cash in terms of the

758
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:33,560
cannabis economy because of federal

759
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:36,230
prohibition so it's and you know we also

760
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,210
have to consider the fact that many

761
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,890
people in jail or jail are in jail

762
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,750
because of drug crimes they're in prison

763
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,390
because of cannabis violations I think

764
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,500
over 40,000 cannabis British prisoners

765
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:49,160
in the United States and there's

766
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:52,220
probably no place worse to be now and in

767
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,500
prison because it's close quarters and

768
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,670
prisons are hot the hot beds for the

769
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:00,140
kovat 19 virus and prisoners are dying

770
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,779
prison workers are being infected and

771
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,630
it's another aspect of how the drug war

772
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:08,230
on cannabis prohibition has contributed

773
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,500
negatively to the situation we're now in

774
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,099
Wow

775
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:16,039
yeah well at least I guess one silver

776
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:19,009
lining is that at least in my state in

777
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:21,320
Massachusetts and yours in California

778
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,810
and others at least cannabis is being

779
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,130
considered essential so hopefully that's

780
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:27,559
a step in the right direction we can

781
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:31,360
start maybe correcting some of these

782
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:33,279
wrongs I know we're coming up on either

783
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:38,710
I'm sorry go ahead

784
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:41,390
you should sooner or later we hope right

785
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:44,150
no absolutely so I know we're coming up

786
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:46,369
on on the on the time here so I wanted

787
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,019
to give you a chance to tell the folks

788
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:51,639
where they can learn more about you or

789
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:55,340
some of the work that you're doing with

790
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:58,909
project CBD it's project CBD org we have

791
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:01,160
a website that's dynamic and a good

792
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:03,679
source of information now we've been in

793
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,869
this game for now ten years we were

794
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,819
involved in actually introducing CBD

795
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:10,250
into the medical marijuana world at

796
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:13,010
California back in 2010 and it spread

797
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,840
from there I think the website is a

798
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,270
really good source of information a good

799
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,460
educational resource for interested in

800
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:21,110
regularly interested in all aspects of

801
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,519
cannabis and cannabinoids particularly

802
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,370
the therapeutic and scientific

803
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:26,789
dimensions and as you pointed out you

804
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:28,589
know we try to stick on

805
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:31,829
focus on the important stories and

806
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:36,900
certainly Kovac 19 today's is preeminent

807
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:39,210
in that regard absolutely am and as I

808
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,910
said at the top of the interview were

809
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:45,240
very happy to have you at km ed 2020 for

810
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:48,539
this year your presentation at cam at 19

811
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,609
last year was one of the most popular

812
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:52,800
most well attended so I encourage

813
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:55,200
listeners to check out that video I'll

814
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,280
put a link to it in the in the show

815
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:01,019
notes so again excited to have you and

816
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,060
hope to see you out there and Pasadena

817
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:05,429
this fall so thanks again Franklin

818
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:08,309
important oh well thank you and I hope

819
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:10,589
we can all join together in Pasadena and

820
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:12,590
be there actually in the flesh rather

821
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:16,380
than virtual that would be wonderful

822
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:19,370
yeah that is the plan so let's hope that

823
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,360
happens so thanks again

824
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:33,239
thank you

825

[Music]

826
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:43,190
