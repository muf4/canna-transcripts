00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,000
[Applause]

2
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,798
thank you

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,679
thank you very much indeed thank you for

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,079
getting back

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,198
up so early in the morning to hear a

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,320
scientific lecture

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,800
so i'll try to give an overview of

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,198
what we know in several fields of

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,560
cannabis research and i'll be delighted

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,039
to to answer any questions that you may

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:36,000
have

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,000
at the end of the lecture and that's why

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
my title the title of the lecture is

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,119
looking back

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,319
and ahead for looking back will give us

16
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,878
some background

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,079
of what's going on at the moment and

18
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,039
looking ahead is

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,079
well let's hope that we're looking ahead

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,960
to

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,799
better medicines we're looking ahead of

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,558
helping a lot of patients

23
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:03,599
in a lot of diff with a lot of different

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,920
diseases now this was not what

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,719
went on many years ago when we started

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,799
work

27
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:14,239
and many years means about 50 years ago

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,118
i was just appointed to one of the

29
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,000
institutes research institutes in israel

30
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,200
and

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,920
as i'm a natural products chemist i was

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,320
looking for

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,799
interesting projects in the field of

34
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,319
natural products chemistry and

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,439
pharmacology

36
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:34,239
and one of the topics i

37
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,758
chose was looking into the chemistry

38
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,599
pharmacology and later hopefully

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,640
biochemistry

40
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,118
of cannabinoid cannabis and i was

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,200
surprised very surprised to find out

42
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,840
that while we knew quite a lot about

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,118
morphine which had been isolated from

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
opium many many decades previously and

45
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,319
the same was true for

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,879
cocaine from coca leaves the chemistry

47
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,078
of

48
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,879
cannabis was not well known as a matter

49
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,000
of fact the

50
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,158
active product or products had never

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,118
been isolated in a pure form

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,920
the structure was unknown and this is

53
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,439
not just

54
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,679
an academic matter uh there today

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,000
it is impossible to do pharmacological

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,319
or biochemical or clinical work

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
unless we know exactly what we're

58
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,079
working on i mean

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,879
you cannot do a clinical trials and tell

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,840
a patient

61
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,318
take cannabis and then publish it

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,039
because

63
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,639
physician today and rightly so will not

64
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,000
accept it as data

65
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:39,199
they want a scientific

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
re-based quantitative data they want to

67
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,119
know

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
rightly so what's going on exactly and

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,239
so

70
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:51,518
the starting point was still is

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,640
let's start with the chemistry elucidate

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,840
the chemistry

73
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,878
and go ahead into biochemistry

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,598
pharmacology and

75
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,399
hopefully clinical trials but there was

76
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,560
completely

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,480
there was not no interest at all as a

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,840
matter of fact when we started

79
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,959
working we couldn't get a s

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,598
a grant from nowhere uh

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
which was unpleasant we had to do

82
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,039
everything

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
uh some a colleague minor a few

84
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,239
colleagues of mine myself

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,560
we had to do everything by ourselves

86
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,480
there was absolutely no interest

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,400
whatsoever as a matter of fact

88
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,079
at the scientific institute where i was

89
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
working there telling me why don't you

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
work on peptides it's much more

91
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,439
important

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,439
than looking at a

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,760
plant out there well now things are

94
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,959
different

95
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,840
when we were asked last year to

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
write a review in nature nature

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,080
neuroscience

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,959
and cannabis and they had actually

99
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,120
four reviews one after the other on the

100
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,239
same topic on cannabis in different

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,438
aspects of cannabis there uh one came

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
out with a history

103
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,479
and background they put it on the front

104
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,719
cover with

105
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,560
as you can see with the brain from which

106
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,919
cannabis is

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,080
coming out well things have changed

108
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,839
so i can see so many people coming here

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,319
at half past eight in the morning to

110
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,959
hear

111
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,759
scientific lecture it it couldn't have

112
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
happened

113
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,319
uh 30 40 years ago well

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,720
why is the interest there there is a

115
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:31,680
review recently published by two nih

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,240
scientists very distinguished scientists

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,519
and they say amongst many other things

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,120
modulating endocannabinoid activity

119
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,599
may have therapeutic potential in almost

120
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,439
all diseases affecting humans and i give

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,320
a long list of

122
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,680
diseases and a huge number of references

123
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,240
which i've taken out

124
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,519
uh and you can see it's

125
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,680
neurodegenerative inflammatory et cetera

126
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,879
et cetera

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,918
and cancer and so on now i

128
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,519
do not know any other biochemical system

129
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,799
biological system

130
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,120
which uh for which we can say

131
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,160
that it has therapeutic potential in

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,519
almost all diseases affecting humans

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,000
this is very very unusual we cannot say

134
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,560
this

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,600
for the dopaminergic system we cannot

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,399
say this for the

137
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,520
serotonergic system it is something else

138
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,399
entirely

139
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:32,240
so obviously uh even if it is only

140
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,560
70 80 90 percent true it is still of

141
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,639
great interest and i assume that this is

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,519
one of the reasons why so many people

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,478
are now

144
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,000
interested in the cannabinoid system

145
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,038
from many points of view

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,918
so i'll try to summarize uh some of the

147
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,360
things that

148
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:52,319
i see is interesting but let me start

149
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
back a few years ago three three four

150
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,800
thousand years ago

151
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,960
with the assyrians they actually knew

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,759
quite a bit and we know that they knew

153
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,799
because they left uh

154
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,919
evidence most of the other tribes that

155
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
were around

156
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,120
most of the other nations that were

157
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,080
around at that time didn't leave that

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,959
much evidence

159
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,560
but the assyrians left the evidence on

160
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,879
stone and so we can read it

161
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,478
as long as it has not been destroyed by

162
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,159
those crazy people now

163
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,839
fighting it there but this particular

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
one is uh

165
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,439
in london so it's still there well they

166
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,319
had the name

167
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,199
for cannabis depending on its activity

168
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,439
rather than

169
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,600
on the plant itself and they called it

170
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,160
gansey gunu and i had somebody

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,120
and a syrian scholar translated for me

172
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,880
and it said

173
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,800
that it is the drug that takes away the

174
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,478
mind which is not a bad definition

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,120
probably better than pot or something

176
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,318
else so but the director takes

177
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,720
away the mind is just for the

178
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,240
psychoactivity

179
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,319
but when it was used for a clinical

180
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,079
uh when the use was clinical and we are

181
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,680
not exactly sure what kind of

182
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,120
diseases they were treating it seems

183
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,840
that they were treating neurological

184
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,240
diseases

185
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,159
they call it hazalo and they also used

186
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,598
it in religious rights which i

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
understand that also

188
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,000
not unknown here but if we jump ahead a

189
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,399
few years 2000 years ahead

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,439
we see that the romans and the greeks

191
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,598
also use it

192
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,000
but surprisingly not for the

193
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:20,319
psychoactivity

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,519
and i i think that it can be well

195
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,280
explained

196
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,198
uh european cannabis hemp really

197
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,038
does not contain dhc and therefore they

198
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,840
didn't see any psychoactivity

199
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,959
otherwise i'm sure that the romans would

200
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,239
have used it they

201
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,680
really try to to find

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,759
ways to to

203
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,598
enjoy themselves well the pliny said

204
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,560
that they're good for

205
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,159
pain and their squared is said it is

206
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,478
they are good for inflammations and

207
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,520
these cory this was a major

208
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,560
influence over 2000 years the book or

209
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,839
the book

210
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,519
of the ascoridus on drugs was really

211
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,038
repeated and translated

212
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,680
and copied and people used it until the

213
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,370
mid 19th century but if we jump another

214
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,959
2 000 years ago

215
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,879
[Music]

216
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:16,638
the physician of queen victoria

217
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,840
called russell reynolds used to

218
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,960
get cannabis from india for queen

219
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,159
victoria

220
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:27,198
that suffered for migraines and he found

221
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
that the european cannabis was not good

222
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,840
for her

223
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,240
but indian cannabis was very good for

224
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,958
her well we know that's true

225
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,120
under certain circumstances uh migraines

226
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,639
can be treated or can be prevented or

227
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,839
the activity or the

228
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:45,278
uh action of

229
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,560
the migraine can be lowered but so

230
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:51,679
we have known a lot about cannabis but

231
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:55,199
as you are well aware

232
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:57,519
then interest

233
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,360
probably was there to a certain extent

234
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,879
but because of legal problems and

235
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,000
because of

236
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,559
supply problems nothing or not much was

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,958
done

238
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,039
although two major groups worked on

239
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,479
cannabis in the 30s

240
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,679
roger adams in the us and alex stout who

241
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,920
got a nobel prize

242
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,199
for working something else they worked

243
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,399
on it but they never

244
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,800
succeeded in act actually isolating

245
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,120
the main compounds there and therefore

246
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,120
work

247
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:31,600
didn't go ahead we got from the police

248
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,599
and in all my early papers i say thanks

249
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,278
to the police which is not very usual

250
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,480
in scientific papers we

251
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:43,200
we got a cannabis so hashish

252
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,560
hashish is a cannabis that's grown in

253
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,399
lebanon and put in

254
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,000
small bags and smuggled so we got part

255
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,879
of the smuggled material

256
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,559
and we started the extracting smuggled

257
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,399
material and using

258
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,479
modern methods or at least methods that

259
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,799
were modern at that time

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,600
we were able to isolate a huge number of

261
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,958
compounds

262
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,159
now this is maybe the reason why science

263
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,799
or why chemistry

264
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,600
had not developed until then the mixture

265
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,000
is

266
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,560
so complicated that people or scientists

267
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,399
chemists were not able to identify to

268
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,838
isolate the compounds in there

269
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,919
so we started isolating

270
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,680
individual compounds and we were

271
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,679
surprised to see that

272
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,519
there are a huge number of compounds now

273
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,479
those of you that remember their

274
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,639
chemistry will see

275
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:38,879
these compounds are closely

276
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:42,319
related if you wish and we gave

277
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,320
their names depending on

278
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
the terpene part of the molecule we

279
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
called it canopy general

280
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
and we called the canopy cycle and

281
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,159
canopy chromine

282
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,599
and so on but although today they are

283
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,360
known about

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,639
oh i would say 50 60 maybe 80

285
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,278
compounds of this type two

286
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,199
of them have been investigated properly

287
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,879
they are the major ones

288
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,480
these are two of them are

289
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:15,360
cannabidiol cbd and tetrahydrocannabinol

290
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,560
and only one of them the thc causes the

291
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,120
psychoactivity

292
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,199
so there has been a huge amount of work

293
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,639
over the last decade i would say

294
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,959
uh on thc somewhat less than

295
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,199
cbd and cannabidiol because it doesn't

296
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,359
cause the psychoactivity and therefore

297
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,360
the people were less interested now

298
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,560
nowadays it seems that

299
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
actually interest is

300
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,559
going on more on canopy dial because of

301
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,959
its uh

302
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,119
therapeutic activities and not being

303
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,958
toxic and not being psychoactive

304
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,399
it can be given it can be administered

305
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,559
to patients at

306
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,240
huge uh amounts without any side effects

307
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,319
so there is a lot of interest in

308
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,560
cannabidiol and i hope to

309
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,600
have the time to tell you of some of the

310
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,278
work we and

311
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,200
others have been doing and both

312
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,519
compounds

313
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,399
well what do we at that time what did we

314
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,959
mean by

315
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,879
active well we didn't know much about

316
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:14,078
the activity so we tried it on

317
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,519
rhesus monkeys and only one compound thc

318
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,919
caused sedation to the monkey

319
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,560
here we have one of the monkeys without

320
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,399
getting any material very active

321
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,000
a little bit dangerous to get near it it

322
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,958
can bite you but

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
the other one injected with uh about

324
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,719
three

325
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,760
milligrams total dose of thc became

326
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,800
sedated

327
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:40,078
and my students usually say that

328
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,199
well that particular rhesus monkey looks

329
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,599
like a professor

330
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
thinking

331
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,200
well for the next nearly 20 years

332
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
a lot of people looked at these

333
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,360
compounds

334
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,959
and we got to know a lot about the

335
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
mechanism the biochemistry the

336
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,199
pharmacology of

337
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,479
these two compounds one thing that was

338
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,079
not known

339
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,278
uh and there was a mistake in the

340
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,599
literature was the mechanism

341
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,320
there was a mistake in the literature a

342
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,920
group at

343
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,120
oxford in the uk a major pharmacological

344
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,519
group

345
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
decided or wrote or brought some

346
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,519
evidence

347
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:28,079
that thc acts in a non-specific manner

348
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,320
maybe dissolving a nerve or dissolving

349
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,439
the nerve sheet and so on and that's why

350
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,440
it acts

351
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,600
and it was not a very great interest and

352
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,839
people didn't do much about it

353
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,199
well we didn't think that that's correct

354
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,320
and we found

355
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,519
evidence that actually it is not correct

356
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,440
and therefore

357
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,560
there should be something more specific

358
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
whether it's an

359
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,719
enzyme whether cannabinoids work in an

360
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,838
enzyme work on a receptor

361
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,278
work in some other biological way and

362
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,600
a group here in the us allen howlett

363
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,958
did some excellent work and found the

364
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,240
first receptor

365
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:07,359
and that receptor was found in the brain

366
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,759
in mice in exactly those areas

367
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,600
that are relevant areas that have to do

368
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,838
with movement control

369
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,199
with body movement coordination learning

370
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,519
and memory higher cognitive function

371
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,278
reward pathways and so on so this was

372
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,879
exactly the areas of the brain

373
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:28,159
one would expect a receptor to be found

374
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,720
now we know

375
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,319
that receptors and not found just

376
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,879
because there is a plant out there

377
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,800
does we it doesn't work that way

378
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,958
otherwise we'll have

379
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,319
a fantastic number of receptors in the

380
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,518
brain and it is

381
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,639
not true we have a limited number of

382
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,320
receptors and they're there because we

383
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,360
or animals produce

384
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,560
specific compounds that

385
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,759
bind to these receptors activate them

386
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:03,119
or block their activity and

387
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,319
that's the way receptors work

388
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,000
so we had to go out

389
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,920
and find the compounds that we produce

390
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,519
and these compounds would stimulate or

391
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,759
block the activity

392
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,959
of the receptor that allen howlett had

393
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,759
found now how

394
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,679
do you find a receptor it's not found in

395
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,240
great quantities normally it's found in

396
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,679
very

397
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,799
small amounts uh frequently like

398
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,359
cannabis endocan

399
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,319
endogenous cannabinoids they are found

400
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,680
uh

401
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,399
they're formed when and where needed so

402
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,519
we would expect to have absolutely

403
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,600
minimal amounts

404
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,679
not very simple to do it well how does

405
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,560
one do that in general one takes a

406
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,198
compound

407
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,799
that is very potent and in this case we

408
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:49,519
had a compound that's extremely

409
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,879
important

410
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,799
we called it h2h hebrew university we

411
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,120
we took that compound which is very

412
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,799
potent labeled it

413
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,639
and uh try to get it to bind to the

414
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:06,000
receptor which it does

415
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,639
and then we tried fractions from the

416
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,759
brain

417
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,079
that will kick out

418
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,680
this particular labeled compound from

419
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,719
his binding to the receptor

420
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,439
and those areas that do that then we

421
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
can take them from the particular area

422
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,720
of the brain

423
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
and try to analyze it and so on it's

424
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,920
easy to tell about it

425
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,079
doesn't take much time it took us two or

426
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,319
three years to do it a lot of

427
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,198
the work because it turned out that the

428
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,759
compounds

429
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,799
ultimately are not very stable but after

430
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,839
two years so three years of work

431
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:44,000
my post docs bill devane

432
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,560
and others found and we were able with

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
some modern equipment to determine the

434
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,518
structures and the

435
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,440
two structures we found out

436
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,639
two compounds which are present in our

437
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,959
brain and

438
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,159
in our body the first one we called

439
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,278
anandamide

440
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,399
ananda in sanskrit is a supreme joy and

441
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,038
we thought

442
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,558
probably correctly to a certain extent

443
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,838
we thought that it may be

444
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,838
involved in our

445
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:16,078
in enjoy the effects

446
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,959
and we called it indeed anandamite the

447
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,159
other one

448
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,839
uh we should have called an under ester

449
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,160
but we're not sure at the beginning

450
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,678
that it is indeed a natural product so

451
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,000
we called it two aging d

452
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,798
turned out that both compounds are the

453
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,599
major

454
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,480
endogenous cannabinoids in our body in

455
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,000
our brain

456
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,839
and thc in fact mimics

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,240
the activity of these endogenous

458
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,639
compounds so here we have

459
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,558
endogenous compounds of extreme interest

460
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,640
at least to us of extreme interest

461
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,918
and these two compounds are being

462
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,120
mimicked in their activity

463
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,080
by thc so

464
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,199
here we had a good basis and it has been

465
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,038
supported by

466
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,558
hundreds of papers and there is a lot of

467
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,558
interest in the escape

468
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,399
in these compounds now those few that

469
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,639
remember their chemistry will see that

470
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,679
anandamide and two aged endogenous

471
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,919
compounds

472
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,840
are completely different structurally

473
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,400
from tetrahydrocannabinol

474
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,959
and yet they bind to the same receptor

475
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,840
they're essentially

476
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,558
equivalent in their activity although

477
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,240
thc

478
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,399
stays for a longer time in the body

479
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,599
because it has to be

480
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,919
metabolized and

481
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,519
takes some time and that's why the

482
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,160
activity is prolonged

483
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,798
while anandamite and two ag are formed

484
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,120
when

485
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,160
and where needed not throughout the

486
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,719
brain

487
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,440
not throughout the body when and where

488
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,679
needed

489
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,519
they cause whatever they have to cause

490
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,320
lower pain or do something else

491
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,359
and then they are broken by specific

492
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,119
enzymes

493
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:55,439
so we have now a system which

494
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,879
has become quite complicated first of

495
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,360
all we have the two

496
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
there are two receptors one of them it

497
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,759
causes the psychoactivity

498
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,200
the other one and i'll try to talk a

499
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,679
little bit about the second one

500
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,880
does not cause any psychoactivity but it

501
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,840
is a protective enzyme it seems to be

502
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,440
and it seems to be a receptor that has

503
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,918
to do

504
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,600
in parallel if you wish with the

505
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,280
activity of the immune system

506
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:27,038
it's a protective mechanism

507
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:29,440
activation of the cb2 receptor is

508
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,319
a protective measure it's like the

509
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,400
immune system

510
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,159
the immune system guards us against

511
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,640
mostly it does all kinds of other things

512
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,880
but it guards us mostly against

513
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,080
proteins microbes come coming from the

514
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,600
outside

515
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,480
this but there are many things that are

516
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,079
not involved this particular system

517
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,480
complements the activity of the immune

518
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:52,399
system so we have two receptors

519
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,440
we have two major endogenous compounds

520
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
that

521
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,679
affect these two receptors we have

522
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,519
enzymes

523
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,519
that form

524
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,240
these endogenous compounds and enzymes

525
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,960
that break down these endogenous

526
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
so we can work on them if we suppress

527
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,600
one of them those that form the

528
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
uh endogenous cannabinoids and we have

529
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,678
lower amounts of those

530
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,679
endogenous cannabinoids if we suppress

531
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,919
the enzymes that break down

532
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,759
these two endogenous cannabinoids then

533
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,000
we have higher levels

534
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,960
so there is a lot of there are a lot of

535
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,880
possibilities

536
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
and this is what happens in the body

537
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,240
then we have

538
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,038
thc and cbd dhcx and the receptor cbd

539
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,319
does not

540
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,279
we really do not know when

541
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,918
and where cannabidiol works we have some

542
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:49,279
indications in many diseases in many

543
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,720
different physiological states we know

544
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,558
that particular activity that our

545
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
cannabidiol works but there is something

546
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,918
missing

547
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,239
we still i'm not sure what how

548
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,720
cannabidiol works in all cases

549
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,319
and then we discovered and many other

550
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,038
groups also discovered that

551
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,759
that in addition to anandamite and 2ag

552
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,960
there is a

553
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,240
huge huge number of compounds closely

554
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,558
related chemically

555
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:19,599
now an underbite is a simple compound

556
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,918
it is a fatty acid in the body there are

557
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:25,279
about 20 of them there is a fatty acid

558
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,520
bound to amino acid that's it simple

559
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,399
a little bit of a few changes but that's

560
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,960
it fatty acid bound to amino acid now we

561
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,600
have

562
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,360
a few a few fatty acids we have a few

563
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,158
amino acids they can bind

564
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,879
to each other and therefore we have

565
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,640
something like

566
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,760
200 of them in our brain in our body

567
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,360
and we know very little about the

568
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,879
activity of these

569
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:52,558
200 or 150 200 compounds some of them

570
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,240
present in minute amounts

571
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,558
some are present in somewhat larger

572
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,960
amounts we are starting to learn about

573
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:58,480
them

574
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,000
and it turns out that those that have

575
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,759
been investigated

576
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,279
all of them all of those that have been

577
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,599
investigated have

578
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,678
some kind of activity not necessarily

579
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,599
cannabinoid type activity they may have

580
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,280
all kinds of other activities and i'll

581
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,038
mention some of them so the field is

582
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,440
becoming very complicated

583
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,480
we have so many compounds now why does

584
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,519
the body make

585
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,440
so many compounds difficult to say maybe

586
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,960
it has something to do with

587
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,558
other things that are happening maybe it

588
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,279
has to do with

589
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,399
our personality information of our

590
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,639
personality but

591
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,679
so we have an endocannabinoid system

592
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,280
which is becoming

593
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,559
quite complicated and

594
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,879
changes of this endocannabinoid system

595
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,759
may lead to pathological state to

596
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,760
diseases

597
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,960
for one type and another and we have to

598
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,798
learn that and

599
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:54,240
in order to modify the changes which

600
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,918
cause the disease so after making things

601
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,960
very complicated i'll

602
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,559
try to go into uh specific

603
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,558
uh diseases if you wish but let's see

604
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,158
what did the endocannabinoids do my good

605
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,279
friend dimaso said well

606
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,840
that was almost 10 years ago well

607
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,480
the endocannabinoids call person to

608
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,199
relax

609
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,558
eat sleep forget and protect well you

610
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,880
can see that out of these

611
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:24,240
five activities uh four are certainly

612
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,400
positive relax eat sleep protect

613
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,279
forget is that so positive well it is

614
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,360
positive

615
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,639
if you go into a supermarket and you see

616
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,319
500 people there

617
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
you definitely don't want to remember

618
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:38,319
all of them this

619
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,400
so forgetting is also positive

620
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,759
as long as it is in the right way of

621
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,278
doing it

622
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,440
now we know that it's much more

623
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,400
complicated than that

624
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,480
this is a slide that i prepared some yes

625
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,080
a year ago and we have a

626
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,960
short list i can probably add another 20

627
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,240
activities and they the endocannabinoid

628
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,600
system is involved

629
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,480
from anxiety appetite blood pressure etc

630
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,399
etc

631
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,278
down to movement disorder neuro

632
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,720
protection pain reproduction

633
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:12,960
stress so it is essentially all

634
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,400
essentially all activities so if there

635
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,798
are any changes

636
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,559
in the endocannabinoid system we can see

637
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,759
changes in that kind of activity well

638
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,678
not a very simple

639
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,038
situation certainly not a very simple

640
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,480
situation uh

641
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:28,240
for um for a clinician uh he cannot

642
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,480
treat all of these things

643
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:35,919
so i'll try to show how

644
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,278
specific these changes can be i will not

645
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,679
go into the biochemistry

646
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,880
not going to the physiologists it will

647
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,159
take too much time i'll

648
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,840
mention just one thing

649
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,000
as we know the nerves are not a

650
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,558
nerve is not a string from one place to

651
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,038
another definitely not

652
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,038
we have

653
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,919
breaks in that a

654
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,759
string if you wish and the break

655
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:12,880
is in order to make

656
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,879
possible regulation of the

657
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,159
symptom of the signal signal that goes

658
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,640
from one place to another place

659
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,480
and this break is called the synapse and

660
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,080
we have the pre-synaptic part and the

661
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,120
post-inactive part

662
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,119
and the movement the

663
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,879
movement of the signal from one part to

664
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,199
another is chemical

665
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,120
there are chemicals that go from the pre

666
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,360
synapse to the post synapse

667
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,199
well the body does it more complicated

668
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,240
it has to regulate that

669
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,679
movement of chemicals

670
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,000
dopamine or any others or glutamate

671
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,120
it has to regulate it how does it

672
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,640
regulate it

673
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,759
one of the ways is by the

674
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,320
endocannabinoid mechanism

675
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,480
then the cannabinoids when needed are

676
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,798
formed under post-synapse

677
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,839
they move from the post-synapse to the

678
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,879
pre-synapse

679
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:08,839
they bind to the to their own

680
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,480
receptors and then they can block the

681
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:15,038
release of neurotransmitters

682
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,519
from the pre-synapse to the post-synapse

683
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:20,839
so in addition to the activity

684
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,000
their own activity the activity of the

685
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:25,439
endocannabinoids

686
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,038
they also regulate the activity of many

687
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,080
other neurotransmitters

688
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,400
and that's why it ha they have so many

689
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,278
activities because they have activities

690
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,880
of their own

691
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:39,919
and they also regulate the activities of

692
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,720
quite a few other neurotransmitters so

693
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,640
things are becoming very complicated but

694
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,839
i will

695
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,559
not go into that part of cannabinoid

696
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,639
research

697
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:57,278
but we'll go and speak about specific

698
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:00,480
uh situation or clinical situations

699
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:03,839
uh like neuroprotection

700
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,440
my good friend esti shohami

701
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:10,119
she's a specialist in brain trauma

702
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,600
we looked at the levels of one of the

703
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:15,759
endocannabinoids

704
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:17,398
after brain trauma in in mice

705
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,519
and we saw that one of the

706
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:22,558
endocannabinoid 2ag

707
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:25,599
goes up nearly 10 fold

708
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,918
after brain trauma

709
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,278
so is that just because the brain has

710
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,000
been traumatized and

711
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,278
doesn't know what it does or is it just

712
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,278
a reaction

713
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,398
of the brain in order to lower the

714
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:40,558
damage

715
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:44,000
and the red thing you can see here

716
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,879
shows the level of 2ag after the brain

717
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,398
trauma

718
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,520
with after four hours quite a bit and we

719
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,798
thought well let's see

720
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:56,079
whether it's a protective mechanism

721
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:59,679
so we synthesized enough 2ag

722
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:04,000
and gave it to traumatized

723
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:07,038
mice and went on to look whether

724
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,919
the damage that has been done on the

725
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,879
brain

726
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,320
goes down and indeed i will not go into

727
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,080
great details we gave

728
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,158
we did all kinds of things but we gave

729
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:19,038
these brains to

730
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,520
the histologists and they were surprised

731
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:23,519
to find out that those brains

732
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,798
the brains of mice that had been

733
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:29,200
administered to

734
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:32,079
ag had 50 percent less damage

735
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,960
you can see the damage the white part in

736
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,558
the brain

737
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,399
those that receive 2ag have much less

738
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,079
white part that's the damage power

739
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,839
that's a dead part if you wish

740
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,000
then the controls that didn't receive to

741
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,918
2ag

742
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
and that was done several times that was

743
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,320
published in nature

744
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,320
quite quite a few years ago and so we

745
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,759
believe we strongly believe that

746
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:59,119
these compounds are neuroprotective

747
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,000
after brain trauma now why this has not

748
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,319
advanced

749
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,159
to clinical trials although we've

750
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,839
completed quite a lot of work on that

751
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,760
and other people have done also work

752
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,038
and that i have no idea but this is

753
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,640
something quite general

754
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:15,839
we have a lot of interesting data

755
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,960
in mice and that's it it has not

756
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,599
progressed further

757
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,440
although brain damage contestants are of

758
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:25,359
extreme importance nowadays

759
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,679
not nowadays it always have been

760
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,519
what about actions that go through the

761
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,840
cb1 receptor

762
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:36,879
well uh those clinicians here or

763
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,918
general public knows that cancer

764
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,120
chemotherapy

765
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,320
although it may be very valuable and at

766
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,278
times

767
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,960
causes side effects again at times which

768
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:50,480
are

769
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,519
very very unpleasant and we decided to

770
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,399
try

771
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:58,798
a thc in cases of cancer chemotherapy in

772
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:58,798
children

773
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:05,038
i was in close touch with a colleague of

774
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:08,159
mine head's a department of

775
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,640
pediatric cancer in one of the hospitals

776
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,240
and of course she was telling me about

777
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,520
the tragic situation

778
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,839
children getting cancer chemotherapy uh

779
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,240
being crying most of the time and

780
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,879
feeling terrible and it was a tragic

781
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,839
for them and for the families could we

782
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,039
do something

783
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,398
so we decided to try thc and do a double

784
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,200
blind study

785
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:31,918
50 of the children will get a placebo 50

786
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,679
will get

787
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,200
thc in addition to the cancer

788
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,120
chemotherapy of course

789
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,319
and after a week she came back to me

790
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,558
said i can't do it

791
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,439
i know exactly who is getting it maybe

792
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,599
double blind

793
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,278
or triple blind or four times blind i

794
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,519
know exactly who is getting it

795
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,038
those that are getting the thc do not

796
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,278
vomit they feel fine

797
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,158
those that are not getting it feel

798
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,558
terrible

799
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,440
so she did an open study we ultimately

800
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,798
published it

801
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,159
and we found that indeed thc

802
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:04,639
given to those children in uh

803
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,159
olive oil under the tank helped

804
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,320
essentially 100

805
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,200
of the patients very strange because one

806
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,398
doesn't see in

807
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,519
clinical trials 100 of uh activity but

808
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,599
that's what she found

809
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,599
we published it and i believe that it's

810
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,639
being used here and there but not

811
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:25,199
enough and it it can be used it's

812
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:30,159
innocuous and we can help children

813
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,159
suffering from that what happens here

814
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,880
i i can't move the slides can you help

815
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,960
oh here it is

816
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:49,599
then we tried something else we knew

817
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:53,759
that feeding eating

818
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:57,038
is affected by cannabinoids

819
00:31:53,759 --> 00:32:00,398
so pups

820
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:05,200
were injected with an antagonist

821
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,199
to the system to the cb1 and

822
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:11,599
we saw that the pups did not

823
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:14,079
[Music]

824
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,959
go to the mother and did not suck

825
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,639
anymore

826
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,640
although they obviously should have

827
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,880
sucked in order to remain alive

828
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,559
they just didn't sat around their

829
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,159
brothers and sisters did that

830
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:28,720
and continues uh growing

831
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,278
those that didn't just sat around and

832
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,919
after a week or so would die

833
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,519
so obviously the cannabinoid system is

834
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,080
important in certain

835
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,880
uh if as i said if we block it they

836
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,119
don't suck

837
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,399
but if we in the middle after two or

838
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,599
three days is seated

839
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,839
perps are not certain we give them thc

840
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,319
large amounts they will start again and

841
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:54,480
go grow and so on so obviously

842
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:57,918
it's a very important factor in

843
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,038
child feeding and sucking in this case

844
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,038
now a company

845
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,240
looked at that and they also saw that in

846
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,359
cases of

847
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,720
ace for example if aids are given thc

848
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,959
the patients remain at their

849
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,919
weight for a much longer time to those

850
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,480
that got

851
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:24,159
placebo so the company sanofi

852
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,519
had a an antagonist and they gave it to

853
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,440
pay to overweight patients and they

854
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,798
knew that that's a huge number of

855
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,278
patients the us

856
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:34,720
in most of the western countries and

857
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,119
they'll have a

858
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,159
huge number of patients they make a lot

859
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,719
of money and they

860
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,840
develop this particular compound called

861
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,558
it ramona band

862
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,038
and they put it on the market and after

863
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:47,038
uh

864
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,720
just a few weeks they took it out and

865
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:52,079
the reason for that was

866
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,200
they didn't think enough about

867
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,398
the other effects of of uh the

868
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,240
cannabinoid system

869
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,918
the cannabinoid system has to do with

870
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,720
anxiety it lowers

871
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,000
anxiety and if you give an antagonist it

872
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,360
not only blocks

873
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,559
appetite or lowers the amount of

874
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:14,319
a food one it takes but it also

875
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,559
enhances anxiety because we block

876
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,320
the system the system which has to do

877
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,559
with with anxiety

878
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,720
and quite a few patients became anxious

879
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,398
and i believe that one or two

880
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,638
wanted to commit suicide i'm not sure

881
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,118
about it i heard rumors that this was so

882
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,878
and they took it out of the market well

883
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,159
so we have to know

884
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,960
quite a lot before doing something of

885
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,878
that sort

886
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,398
maybe they should have told the patients

887
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,960
if you're anxious don't take it

888
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,398
well anyway rimono bound was taken out

889
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,240
of the market

890
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:49,279
and then another

891
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,959
effect that we worked on and this was a

892
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,320
small clinical trial

893
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:59,679
on traumatic stress disorder ptsd

894
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,960
there are quite a lot of patients with

895
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:05,118
ptsd we had about 10

896
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,159
some of them were soldiers who had been

897
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,480
involved some

898
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:11,279
maybe a friend of theirs was killed next

899
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,079
to them and they went into a

900
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,040
post trauma there were two women that

901
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,720
were raped

902
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,719
there were two

903
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,159
men and a woman i think that were

904
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,839
involved in a traffic accident

905
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:31,039
and we started giving them a thc

906
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,320
five milligrams a day twice or three

907
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,960
times a day

908
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,880
and the clinician who did that work dr

909
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,199
roidman a psychiatrist

910
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,160
he as i said gave them five milligrams

911
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,199
per day

912
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,838
and he looked at a lot of the effects

913
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,679
and there are

914
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:50,078
all kinds of clinical uh things that

915
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,879
people that are involved on ptsd have

916
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,519
developed

917
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,280
and they uh wrote them down and looked

918
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,400
at the frequency of nightmares

919
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,839
the sleep quality uh the

920
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,400
global symptom of severity and so on and

921
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,400
indeed he found that there were positive

922
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,680
effects he didn't

923
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,320
see any complete elimination of the ptsd

924
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,919
but he saw very a great improvement in

925
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,240
particularly in sleep

926
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,079
these patients frequently cannot sleep

927
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,199
or are afraid to go to sleep because

928
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,320
they are afraid that

929
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:26,159
they will uh recall the

930
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,240
if the effect that caused other

931
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,598
trauma that caused this effect whether

932
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,598
it was a

933
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,440
rape or whether it was a an accident

934
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,160
whether it was a person killed next to

935
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,039
him

936
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,078
so i believe that it can be used it

937
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,119
should be used

938
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,119
in a way that

939
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:48,000
we can help uh ptsd patients

940
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,920
what about the cb2 receptor which is

941
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,800
more interesting because the cb2 does

942
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,240
not cause any

943
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,920
uh side effects well um

944
00:36:54,239 --> 00:37:00,399
as i said i believe that the cb2 system

945
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,200
parallels to a lot extend the immune

946
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,720
system

947
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:08,719
uh it has to it can do a lot of

948
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:12,078
a lot of things which in which

949
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:15,358
external proteins are not involved and

950
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,480
indeed there are long lists of effects

951
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,598
which certainly going to show in that

952
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,519
direction

953
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,559
and we believe that the cb2 system

954
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,880
the research on the cb2 system will lead

955
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,719
us

956
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,440
to a lot of information showing that

957
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,239
the two systems together the immune

958
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,159
system

959
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:41,358
and the cb2 action work together

960
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,399
and are of major importance to what's

961
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,358
going on

962
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,240
and indeed we have prepared synthetic

963
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,000
compounds

964
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:52,399
which act only in the cb2 receptor and

965
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,119
these compounds do not bind to the cb1

966
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,039
receptor

967
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,358
you can see the numbers there doesn't

968
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:00,320
matter generally

969
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,960
the fact is they do not bind to the cb1

970
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,359
receptor

971
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,199
they bind only to the cb2 receptor and

972
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:09,039
therefore they can be used

973
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:12,319
hopefully as drugs in the cb2

974
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:14,000
system and the work that has been done

975
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,838
at nih

976
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,519
by a group has shown that

977
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,799
one of these compounds which we call

978
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:25,599
hu910 attenuates inflammation

979
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,800
lowers damage associated with hepatic

980
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,720
reperfusion

981
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,200
injury and there's all kinds of positive

982
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,639
things so i believe that the

983
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:38,319
cb2 specific cb2

984
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,199
action will be of considerable

985
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,240
importance

986
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,480
and quite a few both academic labs

987
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,838
and industrial labs are looking at the

988
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,199
cb2 system

989
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:51,199
because of its lack of side effects

990
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,239
it has been shown to act in crohn's

991
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,279
disease in

992
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:55,679
inflammatory bowel disease in asthma all

993
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,599
this

994
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:02,159
is in animals unfortunately no

995
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,039
clinical trials yes the most important

996
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,879
or most

997
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,320
interesting most advanced thing is

998
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,358
actually work

999
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,720
on cannabidiol as i said

1000
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,319
no cannabidiol does not cause any

1001
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,719
side effects it does not bind to the

1002
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,000
receptors and we have seen that it acts

1003
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,439
on anxiety

1004
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,320
very a good action in anxiety in many

1005
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,960
cases

1006
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,119
we have seen that in mice mice are

1007
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,838
anxious all the time they are afraid

1008
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,720
of of cats they're afraid of us if

1009
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,119
positive they

1010
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,358
stay in a dark part and there is

1011
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,800
something called the elevated plus maze

1012
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:41,199
which is up meter above

1013
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,000
that place where a mouse can be in the

1014
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:46,078
dark or

1015
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,559
it can get out and the amount of time it

1016
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,320
gets

1017
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:53,759
out of the dark place shows the

1018
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,838
lowering of anxiety a lot of psych

1019
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,119
people that work in psychopharmacology

1020
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,639
using this method

1021
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,800
and we found that indeed a cannabidiol

1022
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,838
as well derivatives cannabidiol do that

1023
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,880
they lower the

1024
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,799
anxiety of mice and as we well know

1025
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,079
cannabidiol also lowers the anxiety in

1026
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,760
humans unfortunately

1027
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,560
again we don't have many

1028
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,000
clinical trials i think we have just one

1029
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,039
or two

1030
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,838
inflammation a good friend of mine

1031
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,838
together with the group in the uk

1032
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,480
the person that did the work in the uk

1033
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,358
was in london at that time and now he's

1034
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,400
at oxford

1035
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:38,480
and we found that indeed cannabidiol

1036
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,358
lowers rheumatoid arthritis and

1037
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,800
in mice but here we saw something which

1038
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,838
seems to be quite typical

1039
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,560
for cannabinoids at okay

1040
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:49,279
5 2.5 milligrams per kilo we saw no

1041
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:51,358
effect

1042
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,319
at five milligrams per gallon which is

1043
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,799
the red one

1044
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,239
on the bottom yes there is a very

1045
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,880
positive effect

1046
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,879
i wouldn't explain how we get a clinical

1047
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,480
score but we get a very good effect

1048
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,240
of anti-rheumatoid arthritis

1049
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,639
great but then if we go to higher doses

1050
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:11,439
we get less effect so here we have

1051
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:13,838
something

1052
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,720
which is a double-faced i mean nothing

1053
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,358
at a very low

1054
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,559
level quite a bit of activity at a

1055
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:22,078
somewhat higher level

1056
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:24,799
but then the activity disappears at even

1057
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,680
if the concentration of the drug has

1058
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,119
gone up

1059
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:32,399
so this is not very uh

1060
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,680
simple to to to lead us to clinical

1061
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,440
trials because we have

1062
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,318
to find the amount of material that will

1063
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,960
be relevant

1064
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:41,920
to humans but again it should be done

1065
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,760
now

1066
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,880
this particular disease arthritis is an

1067
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,440
autoimmune disease

1068
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,920
the body attacks its own body so we said

1069
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,760
okay

1070
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,280
if it works and then this kind of

1071
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,359
arthritis maybe

1072
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:00,480
it will work in diabetes type one

1073
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:02,880
which is also an autoimmune disease

1074
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,920
the body attacks the cells that produce

1075
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,800
insulin

1076
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,318
and although there are drugs that work

1077
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,519
in diabetes type one

1078
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,838
insulin by itself works maybe

1079
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,119
we can have a new type of drug which

1080
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,480
will be very efficient

1081
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,760
and indeed when we gave cannabidiol

1082
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,119
to a strain of mice that all of them

1083
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,800
develop

1084
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:30,480
diabetes type one we saw

1085
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,000
a extremely good effects and we started

1086
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,800
giving the drug

1087
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,480
after the mice had were already

1088
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,760
developing the disease

1089
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,358
that is to say that during the 12th

1090
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,200
or 13th week of uh uh

1091
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:47,039
of their lives when they start

1092
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,439
developing diabetes type one

1093
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,800
their body attacks the cells that

1094
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,559
produce insulin

1095
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,519
and normally 80 to 100 percent of these

1096
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,440
mice

1097
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:01,440
get the disease and they die from the

1098
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,240
disease if we give cannabidiol

1099
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,880
at relatively high doses we see that

1100
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,239
only

1101
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,559
30 percent of the mice get the disease

1102
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:14,559
now here really it is

1103
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:18,159
open to clinical trials because the

1104
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,239
disease in this case is exactly the same

1105
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:21,598
it's not just a simple model it is

1106
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,039
exactly the same

1107
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,079
here we have a

1108
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:31,279
situation which the body attacks

1109
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,240
the cells that produce insulin this is

1110
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,680
what happens

1111
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:38,879
in diabetes type one in human patients

1112
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:42,239
we should be able to do a clinical trial

1113
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,318
essentially at once uh and

1114
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,439
unfortunately although we published that

1115
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,719
quite some years ago

1116
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,519
it is still not it is it has not been

1117
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,439
tried

1118
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,679
very unfortunately because i believe

1119
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,159
that here we have an open situation

1120
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,759
and if you look don't forget everything

1121
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,239
else just the

1122
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,119
percent intact eyelets the cells that

1123
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:03,759
produce it

1124
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,240
though the controls only eight percent

1125
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,599
of the

1126
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:11,358
cells are still intact but

1127
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:14,318
if we give cbd 77 of the cells

1128
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,920
that produce insulin are intact a huge

1129
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,639
difference and here we have a

1130
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,680
good explanation and i see no reason why

1131
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:23,279
it shouldn't happen

1132
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:24,078
in humans as well we shall have a

1133
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,359
lecture

1134
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:29,920
on epilepsy later on but

1135
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,838
try to tell you something that we did

1136
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,240
more than 35 years ago

1137
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,318
after looking at animals in animal

1138
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:39,279
trials we decided to go into

1139
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:41,119
epilepsy in humans gave we took 15

1140
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,319
epileptic patients that nothing was

1141
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,119
helping them anymore

1142
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,358
or separated into those that got the

1143
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,920
placebo and those that got

1144
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:51,039
the drug and of those that got the drug

1145
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,318
we gave them for

1146
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,759
four and a half months pure cannabidiol

1147
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:57,599
at very high doses

1148
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,880
now that was not simple because i had to

1149
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,160
prepare in the lab

1150
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,800
about 400 grams almost half a kilo of

1151
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,799
pure cannabidiol which it's not very

1152
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,640
simple for an academic lab to do

1153
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,359
but we got the 400 grams send them to

1154
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,799
south america and they did that that and

1155
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,598
found that

1156
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,000
the four patients out of eight remained

1157
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,200
almost

1158
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,920
completely free of seizures and three

1159
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,239
had a

1160
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,119
partial improvement and one showed no

1161
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,239
improvement

1162
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,200
which was what one would expect in a

1163
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:31,199
clinical trial

1164
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,318
and of course the placebo people

1165
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,719
continue to have

1166
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:35,440
their seizures so we thought 35 years

1167
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:39,039
ago

1168
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,519
well here we have a small trial

1169
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:42,639
it should be expanded by a clinical

1170
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,599
group or by a

1171
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:49,519
company and here we can have a new

1172
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:52,000
anti-epileptic drug and we know that not

1173
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:54,000
all epileptic patients

1174
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,559
are helped by the drugs that exist at

1175
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,880
the moment but then nothing happened

1176
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:03,838
for 35 for almost 30 years

1177
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,200
nothing happened nobody bothered to

1178
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,679
repeat it nobody

1179
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,960
bothered to go ahead and give it to

1180
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,679
adults or children

1181
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,920
but then parents that had epileptic

1182
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,358
children nothing was helping them

1183
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,519
learned of this paper learned of

1184
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:20,639
observations that show that well some

1185
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,119
cannabis

1186
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:25,039
strains with a lot of cannabidiol help

1187
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,440
let's try it because nothing else

1188
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:28,239
helps so there have been a lot of

1189
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,559
individual

1190
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,519
cases in which patients parents have

1191
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:33,440
given

1192
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,599
the drug to their children and it has

1193
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,720
helped and there has been quite a lot of

1194
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,359
noise around it

1195
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,318
in the u.s in particular and therefore

1196
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,639
two years ago

1197
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,318
a clinical trial was started and i

1198
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:47,358
understand the

1199
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:50,559
results are quite positive at the moment

1200
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:52,639
in israel cannabidiol strains

1201
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,599
cannabidiol containing strains

1202
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,480
are officially allowed to be

1203
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,480
administered

1204
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,039
to be given to children and there are

1205
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,838
quite a lot of children that get it

1206
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:05,358
and so this is also happening here but

1207
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,480
it shouldn't have waited

1208
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:13,920
35 years it could have been done

1209
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:18,159
30 years ago why didn't well it didn't

1210
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:21,920
there is there is so much that the clint

1211
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:24,000
that an academic lab can do and i'm

1212
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,079
and this is the situation with quite a

1213
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,318
few of the things i'm describing

1214
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,318
uh schizophrenia slightly different

1215
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:36,159
we had shown that in individual cases

1216
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,358
cannot be dialed very high doses help

1217
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:40,159
schizophrenia

1218
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,119
and a german group did a relatively

1219
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,159
major study

1220
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,280
they looked at schizophrenia and they

1221
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:49,838
found that

1222
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:53,839
indeed a cannabidiol

1223
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:55,119
is equivalent to one of the major drugs

1224
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:56,799
that's being used today

1225
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,640
in schizophrenia with one small

1226
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,359
difference

1227
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,400
although the results were as the same

1228
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:04,078
between the

1229
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,160
drug that's being used today and

1230
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,599
cannabidiol the drug that's being used

1231
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:09,598
today has side effects

1232
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,800
many of these drugs have side effects

1233
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,160
strong side effects

1234
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,400
cannabidiol had no side effects so

1235
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,920
they come as i said they compared cbd

1236
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,960
with sulprite

1237
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,680
and they found that they have

1238
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,880
the same type of activity and i hope i

1239
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:29,679
sincerely hope

1240
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:33,599
that cannabidiol will be used in

1241
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:37,039
schizophrenic patients but i haven't

1242
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,760
heard of any additional clinical studies

1243
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,960
although the

1244
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:44,559
german paper was published 98

1245
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,679
about four four and a half years ago

1246
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,960
and i will end

1247
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:52,480
because of lack of time with graft

1248
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,119
versus hose disease now

1249
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,119
this is a

1250
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:03,358
man caused disease many patients

1251
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,760
with certain cancers have

1252
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:11,279
their bone marrow transplanted

1253
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,640
and this causes

1254
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,640
serious side effects many of the

1255
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:20,480
patients are very sick

1256
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:22,719
and the disease is basically again a

1257
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,480
disease in which the body attacks its

1258
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,639
own body in this case the

1259
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,599
body attacks something that we have

1260
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,318
transplanted

1261
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,800
and the transplant itself attacks the

1262
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:33,920
body

1263
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,359
so what's going on is that the person

1264
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,680
is very sick in cases of children

1265
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,119
i've seen children that have

1266
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,558
transplanted

1267
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:48,559
a bone marrow and they're in a terrible

1268
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:53,359
shape really one cannot stand that

1269
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:57,200
and it was found that

1270
00:49:53,358 --> 00:50:00,480
it lowers the effects

1271
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:04,318
by nearly 50 percent uh

1272
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:07,679
in 100 patients that served as control

1273
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:10,960
we had 46 percent with

1274
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,078
gbhd with the disease and only 12

1275
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,800
percent

1276
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,318
in those that got cannabidiol and those

1277
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,720
that really had a bad

1278
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:19,599
bad case is called the three or four

1279
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:23,358
grade

1280
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:27,519
of uh gvhd we lowered that from 10

1281
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:28,480
to 5 and now a further clinical trial is

1282
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:32,079
going on

1283
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:35,519
with many more patients now um

1284
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,079
i think that uh i'll have to stop here

1285
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,880
though

1286
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,160
i have quite a few other things i would

1287
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,760
have liked to tell you

1288
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:48,399
like new cannabidiol type compounds

1289
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,920
and some regulation vasodilation

1290
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,760
and just mention one thing the

1291
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,960
endocannabinoids like anandamide

1292
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,000
are additional compounds as i mentioned

1293
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,240
first was i said the beginning

1294
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,679
quite a lot of additional compounds way

1295
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:05,598
which do the same thing

1296
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,440
on the top you can see an andamite on

1297
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,400
the bottom you can see a compound called

1298
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,559
arachido oil serine which are not very

1299
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,800
different structurally but they do

1300
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,599
completely different things and we hope

1301
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,839
that

1302
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,880
investigations will go on with these

1303
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:22,558
compounds

1304
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:26,240
and we shall know quite a lot

1305
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:29,280
about them within the next few years

1306
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:33,199
and i want to

1307
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,720
summarize the endocannabinoids are

1308
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,279
involved in a large number of

1309
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:40,879
physiological processes

1310
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,640
with both thc and cbd there are those

1311
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,920
compounds which i didn't have enough

1312
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,078
time to discuss

1313
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,318
that are fatty acids bound to amino

1314
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,480
acids we still have to learn

1315
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:51,920
a lot about them i believe there are

1316
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,838
extreme importance

1317
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,519
surprisingly we know very little about

1318
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:59,039
it and i hope

1319
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:02,159
that specific cb2 agonists will lead to

1320
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:04,639
new types of drugs and i

1321
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:05,759
want to thank the collaborators in

1322
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,039
israel you can see

1323
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,000
on the left people that worked in my lab

1324
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,960
i collaborate with a lot of colleagues

1325
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,800
my lab is

1326
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,800
essentially a chemical about chemical

1327
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,599
lab but i collaborate with people that

1328
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,119
work in

1329
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:24,240
bones in traumas and so on

1330
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,358
and i work with a

1331
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,959
large number of colleagues abroad and

1332
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:32,000
here are some of them

1333
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,039
uh roger pertwee in the uk and you can

1334
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,318
see bone and

1335
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:39,838
the czech state and many many others and

1336
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:41,279
they visit me i visit them and we drink

1337
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:46,239
a lot of coffee together

1338
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:49,440
and we enjoy unchanging information

1339
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,159
and i've visited all of them enjoy going

1340
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,480
in

1341
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,679
to their labs i've been to all of all of

1342
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,440
them except

1343
00:52:53,679 --> 00:53:00,639
one dr masloff in siberia

1344
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,760
had a meeting in a few months ago in

1345
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,480
february

1346
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,359
and he wrote me that no you don't have

1347
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,760
to worry

1348
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,279
the the weather is okay usually it's

1349
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,400
minus 35

1350
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:15,200
centigrade now it's only 25 centigrade

1351
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,680
and i said thank you maybe next time

1352
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:17,679
thank you

1353
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,839
no problem

1354
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,159
we have a few minutes for questions

1355
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,679
folks so if you'd like to ask the doctor

1356
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,838
a question please step up to one of the

1357
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:43,838
mics

1358
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,480
any questions at all we'd love to have a

1359
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,679
few questions

1360
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,679
i'd like to ask a question

1361
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:57,679
if i'm clear you're saying we have found

1362
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,720
anandamide these endocannabinoids and

1363
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:03,279
now we're finding 200 more

1364
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,959
and you're sorting out that code to all

1365
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,640
those

1366
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,519
endocannabinoids is there being a

1367
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:09,759
correlation

1368
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:11,039
made just the way anandamide correlates

1369
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,000
with thc

1370
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,039
are we seeing or are we studying the

1371
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,039
correlation of

1372
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,199
all those other endocannabinoids and

1373
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,759
associating them with the

1374
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:22,838
action or chemical structure of all the

1375
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,520
other

1376
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:28,078
phytocannabinoids from what we know at

1377
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:28,079
the moment

1378
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:35,039
anandamite or thc mimics an endomite

1379
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,919
it doesn't mimic the other compounds the

1380
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,440
body

1381
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,599
[Music]

1382
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,720
is uh lazy so once it knows how to make

1383
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,920
an endomite

1384
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:48,879
it makes a lot of other compounds uh

1385
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,159
going to the same enzyme system but the

1386
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,798
compounds that are formed not

1387
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,239
necessarily

1388
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:55,519
endocannabinoids in their action they do

1389
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:58,159
all kinds of other things

1390
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:59,280
this is known throughout our system for

1391
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:02,159
example

1392
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,920
the steroid system once the body knows

1393
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:06,558
how to make the steroid

1394
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,318
by making small changes on the steroid

1395
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,680
you get different type of

1396
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:14,480
compounds estrogens that work

1397
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,078
as female hormones but you have

1398
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,880
compounds that have nothing to do with

1399
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,440
estrogen

1400
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,559
again with the same basic structure here

1401
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,400
we have the same

1402
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,200
we have the same basic structure an

1403
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,200
amino acid

1404
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,400
bound to a fatty acid but it has

1405
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:31,199
completely different

1406
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,079
activities and as we have 150 compounds

1407
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,519
of that type

1408
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,160
who knows what they are doing so we have

1409
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:38,960
yes

1410
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:40,480
anandamai that is being mimicked by thc

1411
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,679
but we also have a lot of

1412
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,480
other compounds of which we know

1413
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,279
just a tiny little bit one compound that

1414
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,679
i may

1415
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,960
discuss this afternoon is a compound

1416
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,919
which we found that

1417
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,358
has to do with osteoporosis and it

1418
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,798
blocks

1419
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:59,519
the destruction of bones after a certain

1420
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:01,119
age

1421
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,719
so here we have something completely

1422
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,440
different and yet

1423
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,480
it goes following the same chemical

1424
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,358
system

1425
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,039
because the body knows how to do it well

1426
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:11,838
to make a correlation you've discovered

1427
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,838
this

1428
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:17,199
endo chemical that affects osteoporosis

1429
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:20,480
and then would there be

1430
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:21,759
a logical jump then to cbg or another

1431
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,240
phytocannabinoid

1432
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:29,200
that is known as bone growth stimulator

1433
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:30,959
probably i think the answer is yes

1434
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,759
probably yes

1435
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,760
thank you so much

1436
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:43,119
hey my question for you dr micholim is

1437
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:46,798
how much research are you doing

1438
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:49,519
specifically with terpenes and terpenes

1439
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:52,239
in conjunction with cannabinoids

1440
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,759
and what i mean by that is dr sue sicily

1441
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:56,959
who is studying

1442
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:59,760
ptsd with cannabis

1443
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,960
she's not permitted to study terpenes

1444
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,720
with her research

1445
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,119
and we all know that you know the

1446
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,399
d-limonene is what causes

1447
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:10,880
ptsd patients to have bad reactions

1448
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,880
whereas linalool

1449
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,680
is kind of the opposite effect how much

1450
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,720
of your work is devoted to terpenes

1451
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:22,239
well uh the cannabis plant

1452
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,959
contains a large number of additional

1453
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,679
compounds

1454
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,039
compounds that are not cannabinoids

1455
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,519
tonight's terpenes

1456
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,679
flavonoids all kinds of other things

1457
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,599
many years ago we

1458
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:35,279
found that there is something we call

1459
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,920
the entourage effect

1460
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,760
we call it entourage effect meaning that

1461
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,159
compounds that by themselves are not

1462
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,520
very

1463
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:46,798
active or not active at all change

1464
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:48,480
the activity of other compounds in this

1465
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,119
case of cannabinoids

1466
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,838
and indeed this has been seen by many

1467
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,480
people

1468
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:55,838
taking cannabinoids saying well the

1469
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,119
total plant

1470
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,838
works much better than just plain thct

1471
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,160
it sees

1472
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:03,440
an official drug in this country but not

1473
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,798
a

1474
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,838
particularly successful one

1475
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,880
but the plant is and it seems to be that

1476
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:14,000
there is a

1477
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,920
major uh thing for going on

1478
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,519
and it's this unto raj effect

1479
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,599
unfortunately

1480
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,559
in addition to our own paper quite a few

1481
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,599
years ago

1482
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,920
there has been very little work done

1483
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,798
undone to raj effect we know that it

1484
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,480
exists

1485
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:32,880
but it has to be much more

1486
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,480
investigated and it has not been

1487
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,760
investigated which is a

1488
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,798
pity but again it's one of those lacunas

1489
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,920
if you wish that

1490
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:44,719
have to be looked into thank you

1491
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,079
thank you hi my name is valeria and i

1492
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,919
wanted to ask you

1493
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,599
first of all thank you for a wonderful

1494
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,798
presentation

1495
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,760
secondly i wanted to ask you to share

1496
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,239
your

1497
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,559
ideas about the role of cannabinoids and

1498
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:01,519
the transmission of the pain

1499
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,480
signals in in the body the reason i ask

1500
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:04,239
is that

1501
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,000
i went through the literature and i

1502
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:09,838
found out that

1503
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,480
many researchers indicated that

1504
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,400
thc and cannabinoids they do not have

1505
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,358
profound effect on the severe pain

1506
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,160
they may have some effect on the local

1507
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:21,358
pains

1508
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,318
and i know that the recent studies made

1509
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,880
in the uh

1510
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:27,599
performed in the united states by the

1511
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,960
combination of cbd and thc

1512
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:34,240
in the cancer pain didn't produce any

1513
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,599
hopeful results so i want to hear what

1514
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:38,879
you think about that

1515
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:40,400
well i believe you're right it seems

1516
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,280
that a mixture

1517
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,318
in the case of pain at least of cbd and

1518
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,839
thc

1519
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:50,719
seems to be better than thc alone

1520
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:52,880
i wish we had more information of the

1521
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,358
amounts of the types of pain or not

1522
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,039
every pain of course is the same

1523
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,679
cannabinoids do not work on

1524
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:00,480
acute pain but they work on neuropathic

1525
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,519
pain

1526
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:07,280
and we have to know more about it

1527
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:10,400
yes chances are that it's better to

1528
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,240
have both cbd and dhc chances are that

1529
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,039
it's better to have

1530
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:15,838
thc and maybe some of the other

1531
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,960
compounds

1532
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,519
done to rush compounds but again the

1533
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,199
data

1534
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:25,519
in the literature is insignificant

1535
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:26,639
thank you we have time for one more

1536
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:28,880
question

1537
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,480
and then uh uh dr machula will be

1538
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,280
available during coffee break because

1539
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,119
your questions

1540
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,960
um so if you will be out in the lobby

1541
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:39,119
and uh you'll get a chance to meet him

1542
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,318
uh after we break here sir

1543
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,720
first of all thanks for speaking that

1544
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,279
was mind-blowing um but i wanted to say

1545
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:44,239
i just wanted

1546
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,640
to like when you're talking about the

1547
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,000
the cb1 receptor i can't hear you well

1548
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:49,199
oh yeah hold on yeah let me see

1549
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,838
when you're talking about the there we

1550
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,399
go um the cb1 receptor and how you had

1551
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:54,159
that whole

1552
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,440
um program for like how the synapses

1553
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:56,960
work i was wondering what were like the

1554
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,559
obstacles you were facing with the

1555
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,400
like with the cb2 receptor i know you

1556
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,880
were saying we don't know a lot about

1557
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,599
that when compared to the cb1

1558
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,920
i'm sorry i mean i didn't get what did

1559
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:08,000
he

1560
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,000
ask just like the difference between

1561
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,440
studying the cb1 receptor when you have

1562
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,920
the nerve synapse before

1563
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,920
compared to the cb2 well

1564
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:24,519
there should be investigations in both

1565
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:25,919
the cb1 is acted upon by thc by both

1566
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:30,000
endocannabinoids

1567
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:33,280
the cb2 is also acted on

1568
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,239
by thc and both endocannabinoid

1569
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,200
receptors

1570
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:38,159
it acts therefore the activity is

1571
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:41,358
dispersed

1572
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:43,199
i believe that the way we and many

1573
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:46,558
others are going ahead

1574
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:51,118
by trying to have specific

1575
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:53,920
cb2 agonists is very promising

1576
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,480
having the activity only in the cb2 and

1577
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,119
this

1578
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:01,039
in this way eliminating any possible

1579
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:01,680
psychoactivity and this but at the

1580
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,319
moment

1581
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,440
there isn't a single drug on the market

1582
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:08,719
which is

1583
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:11,838
cb2 specific this is yeah

1584
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:15,279
if this was if i understood you well

1585
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:21,838
thank you thank you doctor

1586
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:21,839
thank you i appreciate it

1587
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:27,759
you
