1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,278
thank you for getting up and offering

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,169
your questions please go ahead thank you

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,519
what about pharmacogenetics we all

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:12,509
respond differently

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:16,019
I started cannabis cannabinoid

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:22,560
pharmacogenetic company but recognizes

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:24,028
science just isn't there yet and yet

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,820
there's a few companies that are

9
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:30,539
swearing that they have it what do you

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,030
know what's your opinion so one of the

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,239
comments I have is I had a chance one of

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,270
my patients did do one of those kind of

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,570
cannabinoid genetic tests and the thing

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,899
that bothered me about it was that on

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,200
the paperwork that came back it reported

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,808
that she her child was at a high

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,020
likelihood of becoming cannabis

18
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:58,140
dependent and that really bothered me

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,059
because she got she was like oh now he's

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,189
going to be addicted and all this and

21
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,948
there's really no evidence of that and

22
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:06,329
again medical use we're not talking

23
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:07,188
about addiction independence we're

24
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,000
talking about an endocannabinoid

25
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:11,309
dysfunction and we're trying to treat

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,118
that so if you do one of those tests be

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,040
very careful with what results you get

28
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,250
and make sure that you remember that

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,500
just because you may have a snip or a

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,469
gene it does not necessarily correlate

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,349
to what your experience is going to be

32
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:30,000
with cannabis so I had talked to that

33
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,578
company and said you need to remove that

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
off of the test because again it's kind

35
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:36,359
of like saying oh you're 85 and you're

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,700
starting cannabis and you did this test

37
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,959
now you're gonna turn into a person

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,359
who's addicted to cannabis and is

39
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,030
extremely unlikely so I just want to

40
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:50,908
make sure that people interpret those

41
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:53,790
results carefully I just want to point

42
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,490
out that while our genetics can point us

43
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,560
in directions and give us a few clues

44
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,899
about what might be the case there's

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,490
this huge realm of epigenetics which are

46
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,950
the factors that turn on and off the

47
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,169
genes and affect what happens when those

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,270
proteins are expressed and that there's

49
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,460
just so much complexity I

50
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,950
I like the idea that people are trying

51
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,050
to tie up these levels of complexity

52
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,569
into systems that may eventually give us

53
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,610
usable data but I think as you mentioned

54
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,609
we're pretty far from that right now

55
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,390
just a really quick comment on the

56
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,729
epigenetics and it's largely affected by

57
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:33,389
lifestyle so it comes back to the idea

58
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:35,310
of of physiological context what exactly

59
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:37,649
is happening in the system what is it

60
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,719
bombarded by what kind of conditions has

61
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,260
it been under that's gonna largely

62
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:45,000
affect your response to whatever it is

63
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,929
whatever stimulant we're talking about

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,099
whether it be cannabinoids or a

65
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,740
pharmaceutical or you know any other

66
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,419
compound yep

67
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,460
awesome day guys thanks for everything

68
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:59,099
in your leadership and mentorship

69
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:03,300
through the years I'm from Florida my

70
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,650
name is dr. Barry Gordon Bonnie you said

71
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,260
something that was so interesting to me

72
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,210
that is California advanced out of their

73
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,590
medical into the legal adult responsible

74
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,260
use stage that actually the medical

75
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,849
products were harder to get right and

76
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,889
that's one of the things that we're

77
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,449
seeing in Florida right now we're in

78
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,579
that middle zone where we're still

79
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:23,759
medical but we know we're going towards

80
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,030
legal adult responsible use who do you

81
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,439
think are the best people to impact to

82
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,500
the extent of making sure that we

83
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,409
maintain the medical program in Florida

84
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,360
to the excellence that we have now the

85
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:37,710
ratio products the tinctures the

86
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,230
suppositories things of that nature

87
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,270
because what I found is that in many of

88
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:44,219
the states as they go legal adult

89
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,060
responsible use the medical programs get

90
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,250
left behind

91
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,750
second question now that it's legal in

92
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,169
California have you ever given any

93
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,060
consideration towards slipping a little

94
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:56,489
sublingual five milligram mint or

95
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,229
something into the sublingual space

96
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,629
while you're actually examining your

97
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:03,239
elderly patient for the first time so

98
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,609
that in that in that half hour in that

99
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,010
half hour visit with family and patient

100
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,910
that they can actually experience that

101
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:14,099
first time so you know so to speak

102
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:16,139
intoxication of cannabis right so okay

103
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,209
so the first question is to who do you

104
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,759
address you have to go to your

105
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,979
government you have to

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,680
and it might behoove you to go as a

107
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,680
group the society cannabis clinicians is

108
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,420
a great group to use as a resource you

109
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,980
don't want to repeat what happened here

110
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,689
in California I mean we were the grand

111
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,540
social experiment it got passed by

112
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,100
Californians and nobody the state didn't

113
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,350
want to do anything politicians didn't

114
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,360
want anything doctors called in law

115
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,360
enforcement to go after the doctors in

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,569
the in the beginning it was terrible so

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,800
what really wasn't done very well and

118
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,689
what ended up happening here in

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,810
California is that we had a mandate to

120
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:57,410
regulate medical and then legalization

121
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,959
became on the ballot and that passed and

122
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,510
it just so turned out that both needed

123
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,969
to be kind of completed programs by

124
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,529
January 2018 so our government said well

125
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,720
we're not going to do it separately that

126
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:11,029
will cost too much money so we need to

127
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,800
do it together and I still think it

128
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:16,639
should be separated so if there's a way

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,350
to sever separate it out it Colorado

130
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,089
model so to speak which has the

131
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,960
Department of Revenue control record

132
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:24,079
that's exactly right

133
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,659
so taxes on medical patients in

134
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,269
California can run anywhere from 20 to

135
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,310
35 percent what else is taxed that high

136
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:33,319
that's medicine you don't pay that on

137
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,430
your prozac you don't pay that on your

138
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,230
blood-pressure medication you don't pay

139
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,360
taxes on your medication so I don't

140
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,590
understand why and and I think it just

141
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,120
goes back to the fact that our

142
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,609
government still looks at this as a

143
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,889
medical cannabis as a hoax despite all

144
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,110
this time and all these reports and that

145
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:49,550
oh yes select oh this patient it might

146
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,500
help and that little child it might help

147
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,730
but they don't really realize because

148
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,050
they just don't live in the world that

149
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,090
that we live in here

150
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,949
your second question I'm not allowed to

151
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,859
dispense cannabis in my office so I

152
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:02,659
cannot medicate my patients however they

153
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,449
did have a patient that came in with

154
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,280
lung cancer she was terribly nauseous

155
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,839
she could barely keep her head up she

156
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,329
actually put her head on my desk and

157
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,810
then we had our go lie on the bed and

158
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:17,029
her adult son said I have a bag full of

159
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,310
stuff I bought that I have no idea what

160
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:22,549
it is but can I give something to my mom

161
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,530
we gate we there was a little vaporizer

162
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,600
and there was again before all the vape

163
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,299
nonsense that's going on now and we

164
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,129
broke it open and we gave her a puff he

165
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,129
gave her a cuff in the office I did not

166
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:36,519
and

167
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:39,219
within minutes she had color back in her

168
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,750
face she hadn't said any you know when

169
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,140
you're so nauseous you can't talk

170
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,240
she started talking she was smiling she

171
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,490
walked out of my office so happy so

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,930
there I probably first rally didn't

173
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,790
might be allowed to give somebody

174
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,860
medicines right for this medicine again

175
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,930
we have to get it off the schedule yeah

176
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,330
to me when it becomes legal you know to

177
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,740
a certain extent it would be interesting

178
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:03,789
if you could do that for the first time

179
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,699
in the office hi I'm Susan Sklar I'm

180
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,770
local here in Long Beach in Southern

181
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,379
California I have two clinical questions

182
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:14,279
one is patient with autoimmune hepatitis

183
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:17,250
and fibrosis and there's been talk about

184
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:20,019
some of the can of cannabis products

185
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,439
doing something about fibrosis in the

186
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:25,180
liver and the second one is I treat

187
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,529
patients women with a condition called

188
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,160
burning mouth syndrome

189
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:32,379
that's a neuropathic pain condition they

190
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,450
do very well on hormone restoration

191
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:37,569
about probably about 80% of them but

192
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:39,430
then there are 20% that don't and so I'm

193
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:41,439
just wondering I've heard a lot of talk

194
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,840
about neuropathic pain and pain

195
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:47,589
syndromes which products would I

196
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:49,659
recommend to those women thank you so

197
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:50,919
the answer to the first question I'm not

198
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,930
sure when we did our little stretch

199
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,150
break I kind of covered the liver stuff

200
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,000
maybe you stepped out but the synopsis

201
00:07:55,149 --> 00:08:00,039
is lean heavier on CBD which is anti

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,529
fibrotic and if you want a non-invasive

203
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,050
way to track liver fibrosis in response

204
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:08,799
to an intervention you can use the hepa

205
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:11,889
score or even the FIB for fib - 4 which

206
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,829
is a calculation based on a CBC and CMP

207
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,379
that accurately correlates with a liver

208
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:19,000
biopsy results in terms of fibrosis so

209
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:20,769
you can track it and then as far as

210
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,019
neuropathic pain I mean the best

211
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:24,789
evidence that we have comes from the new

212
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:27,849
pics of moles trials a one to one ratio

213
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,910
is a pretty good place to start I will

214
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,099
say that in cases where oral mucosal

215
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,370
dosing doesn't work sometimes inhalation

216
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,370
does

217
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:45,659
oh hi thank you so much for this and I

218
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,169
hope there's a lot of doctors here I'm

219
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:54,058
from Carmel California I've been doing

220
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:57,328
consulting for seniors since 2012 and in

221
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:59,219
their home and my question is this or

222
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,008
it's an actually a statement and on how

223
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,809
you all feel

224
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:05,669
you know since seniors a lot of them are

225
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:10,588
deficient in their endocannabinoid

226
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:14,128
system and wouldn't it seem right for

227
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:17,639
them to maybe start cannabis like we

228
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:19,889
started now so we're not deficient in

229
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,919
our endocannabinoid system it's just a

230
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:25,049
question because more I'm learning you

231
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:27,919
just want to take it you know to prevent

232
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:30,628
there was a prophylactic perhaps and

233
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,729
then my other quick question was seniors

234
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:34,800
because they're not making tinctures

235
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,009
with alcohol it was a little bit it

236
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,078
burned them to do the sublingual

237
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:43,110
starting out so now that there's more

238
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:45,419
oils the coconut oil and olive oils etc

239
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:52,709
how are they absorb some sublingually

240
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:55,799
are they as well absorbed do we know all

241
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:59,099
right okay so the first question that

242
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:02,458
you asked about preventive so we don't

243
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,278
really have studies but when you see all

244
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,558
the literature I agree with you why not

245
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,938
why wouldn't you there was something I

246
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:11,750
came across when I was doing the

247
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:13,289
literature review where one of the

248
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,929
researchers who looks at

249
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:19,049
neurodegenerative illness wrote in his

250
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:22,219
article I've been looking for something

251
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:25,109
to help prevent neuro degenerative

252
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,139
diseases and the only thing I've come

253
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,980
across is cannabinoids so that's the

254
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,448
answer to that question thank you yeah

255
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,490
you bring up a really good point it

256
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:37,469
comes back to context physiological

257
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,629
context so you want to lay a really

258
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,550
strong foundation right and one of the

259
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:44,459
things that we tend to forget I think in

260
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:46,558
the cannabis field is that

261
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,739
endocannabinoids are made out of fatty

262
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:50,278
acids and so the quality of your diet is

263
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,028
gonna

264
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,438
have a very significant impact on your

265
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:57,328
endogenous endocannabinoids how much

266
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:59,639
endocannabinoids have got then it's not

267
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:02,878
just to AG in anand amide now they're

268
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,009
made out of arachidonic acid and they're

269
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,509
in the 80s and the 90s people were

270
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,730
showing flow charts that show that

271
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:10,769
arachidonic acid went to pge2

272
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,819
which of course is inflammatory except

273
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:17,009
in the gut where it's protective if you

274
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:20,128
so nature paths were telling people that

275
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,360
they shouldn't eat chicken because it's

276
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:23,879
one of the richest meats and arachidonic

277
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,769
acid well okay that's all well and good

278
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,720
but remember any compound in the body

279
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,120
uses a double-edged sword it's got two

280
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,769
directions that can go or multiple

281
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,629
directions actually and so in this case

282
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:36,299
we're a katana Casa de de is actually

283
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,209
beneficial as well so there's a rakha

284
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:42,208
donek acid and then there's the oleic

285
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:45,419
acid the allele derivatives that are

286
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:47,549
endo cannabinoids and even DHA and EPA

287
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:50,610
potentially have got some sort of

288
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:53,938
endocannabinoid effect on tone so if

289
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,459
we're eating well and so remember this

290
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:58,620
if your endo cannabinoid deficient it's

291
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:01,588
not about taking cannabis it's about

292
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,629
let's see well play up regulate our

293
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:06,629
physiological system by playing and

294
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:09,569
having a euphoric experience and not

295
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:11,819
just cannabis induced but life induced

296
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:13,078
and those things in themselves will make

297
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:15,028
a huge difference in terms of the

298
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,479
baseline of the endocannabinoid system

299
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:22,308
then certainly if we need cannabis or

300
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,308
some other compound that makes sense

301
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:32,338
yeah I don't think that there's much

302
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,899
pharmacokinetic data on the sublingual

303
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,939
absorption of oil except for what I

304
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,438
showed you that Italian study but I

305
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:39,659
think it varies widely based on the

306
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:41,849
terpene content in that oil there's some

307
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:44,188
that you can absolutely feel in a minute

308
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,689
or less after that hitting your oral

309
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:47,998
mucosa and something that might take a

310
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:53,219
while and in terpenes are known

311
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:55,139
permeation enhancers hi thank you all

312
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,579
three for a very informative day I'm

313
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,620
Ryan Zack and I'm a physician in

314
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:01,649
Massachusetts I have two questions one

315
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,269
I'd love to hear your experience with

316
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:06,539
cancer patients

317
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:08,370
that come in asking about our so I mean

318
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:10,019
do you have a strategy with them for my

319
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,389
patients I try not to take their hope

320
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:15,960
away but I try to you know suggest

321
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:17,460
multiple strains and several dots or

322
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,509
whatnot so I'd love to hear your take on

323
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:24,150
that and if you had any experience with

324
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:26,340
success because I mean the the original

325
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,409
story is based on a basal cell which

326
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,050
doesn't never made any sense to me in

327
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:33,539
the first place and then the other one

328
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,879
is topicals do what do you have you had

329
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,459
any experience with systemic success

330
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,769
with patients that use topical

331
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,379
preparations or is it mostly from

332
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:45,389
localized areas you mentioned trigger

333
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,620
points eczema or you know skin

334
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:51,569
conditions or more local conditions I'm

335
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,759
happy to answer the cancer question so

336
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,650
we see a wide variety of presentations

337
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,659
and requests right I want to use

338
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,669
cannabis exclusively I want to use it in

339
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:01,079
kanne kanne combination with

340
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:02,969
conventional treatment that's kind of

341
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,530
one major fork in the road and when I

342
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,080
look at people that are wanting to use

343
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:08,850
it exclusively I very often find a

344
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,670
patient that is unaware of their

345
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,990
prognosis and the treatment course what

346
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,399
that would look like if they went

347
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,289
through conventional treatment and

348
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,509
there's a lot of death anxiety in that

349
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:21,539
patient population so that's my first

350
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:24,090
target actually is addressing the death

351
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:27,089
anxiety and getting better information

352
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:29,250
so that we can then make a real decision

353
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,200
and so that I lean with the low-dose

354
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,759
cannabis and I paint the picture of what

355
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,009
we're gonna introduce you to this get

356
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,689
you feeling really good maybe follow

357
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:38,730
some cancer markers you know if there's

358
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,830
non-invasive markers and things that

359
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,029
don't require an expensive skin a lot of

360
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,070
people aren't aware of things like

361
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:48,509
neutrophil the lymphocyte ratio is very

362
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:50,310
easy to follow HSC RP yeah you know ESR

363
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:51,629
there's a lot of markers that can tell

364
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:55,379
you what direction the cancer is going

365
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:57,059
monocyte levels so you know we follow

366
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:58,649
that and then we have the real

367
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,509
conversation at the first follow-up

368
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:02,159
visit which is are we going to shift

369
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:04,409
gears here into the super high-dose

370
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,569
approach which I don't really have a lot

371
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:09,120
of evidence will help you now Mike in my

372
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,310
clinical experience I have cases that

373
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,350
have absolutely responded to cannabis

374
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:15,149
mono therapy at low and moderate doses

375
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,069
one that I'm following right now

376
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,588
testicular cancer

377
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:21,778
that produces HCG so it's very easy to

378
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:24,360
follow and no other treatment in the

379
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:26,429
history of this case beyond cannabis

380
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,379
about 40 milligrams total daily and

381
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:29,219
those levels are down and the patient's

382
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:31,829
doing fine

383
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,350
so while most of the anecdotes you hear

384
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:37,799
about are related to these like 500 to

385
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:41,600
2,000 milligram doses as far as a

386
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,599
response I don't think that's always

387
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,379
recommen my cases that we've seen do

388
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,970
great are those that combine everything

389
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,369
right they use cannabis they

390
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,079
intelligently choose what fits for them

391
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:54,360
personally best from conventional

392
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,068
treatment they paint the picture of hey

393
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,509
I'm sitting in the infusion room

394
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:59,039
everyone else is turning green and

395
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:01,558
looking sick and I'm feeling great

396
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,058
you know it's that that's usually what I

397
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:04,860
see but I think so many people just

398
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:06,899
don't know what they're dealing with and

399
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,649
come in with a lot of anxieties so it's

400
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,899
a good place to start I'm gonna leave

401
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,089
the topical to you but I'm just gonna

402
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,980
comment on the cancer so again because I

403
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,749
take care of children if they're in my

404
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,428
office and they have cancer it's usually

405
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:25,649
because they are at the end of the line

406
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:27,058
and it's unfortunate you know you as an

407
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,519
adult have a right to choose your

408
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:31,588
treatment but pediatric patients do not

409
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,209
if you choose not to have your child

410
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:34,769
treated with chemo and they have cancer

411
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,599
they will take your child away from you

412
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:44,698
and subject them to the chemo and

413
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:47,639
radiation I have had numerous who came

414
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:50,389
to me with end-stage what stage four

415
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,220
there is no stage 5 right metastatic

416
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:57,389
cancers where we have actually achieved

417
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,069
remission I have a Wilms tumor patient

418
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:03,839
who had a kidney removed and then she

419
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:05,970
three months later relapsed pulmonary

420
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,600
relapsed and we have her she's now like

421
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,250
I don't know almost five years out and

422
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:16,198
that was with high-dose cannabinoids

423
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:18,838
added to chemo about she was on I think

424
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,850
nine out of twenty eight plan chemos she

425
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,788
was already cancer-free so they decided

426
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:25,230
to discontinue the rest of the treatment

427
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:28,199
and she's done very well she has

428
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,730
continued on cannabinoid treatments her

429
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,000
mom says she's going to be on it for

430
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,970
life

431
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,329
we and we usually recommend that you

432
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:39,539
should not stop there is a case dr.

433
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:41,730
Jeffrey hergenrother who's a cannabis

434
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,259
physician in Northern California had a

435
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,990
patient who was nine and a half years

436
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:47,789
free from glioblastoma multiforme II and

437
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,819
stopped using cannabis and he relapsed

438
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:52,409
so remember it's not just you you can't

439
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,149
see the little stem cells the cancer

440
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,810
stem cells that are floating around I

441
00:17:54,150 --> 00:18:00,600
have one case of a stage four boy with

442
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:02,700
stage four osteosarcoma who had over 20

443
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,949
or 30 tumors in his chest who became

444
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,380
cancer free on very high doses of CBD

445
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,799
THC it was a Hail Mary I'll just share

446
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,290
that with you combination with chemo

447
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,970
that wasn't working we added in high

448
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:16,950
dose CBD and th so you might say

449
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,289
high-dose 500 milligrams of each that

450
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,920
was in 2015 he is still alive and

451
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,980
cancer-free 500 milligrams daily daily

452
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:28,350
yes and the 500 milligrams of t8 3

453
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,230
divided and tid so about a hundred and

454
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:33,599
sixty-five milligrams of each THC two

455
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:37,680
separate products and he did take it in

456
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:40,829
the RSO formulation sublingually and he

457
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,720
is he just he came to me at 16 wasn't

458
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,669
supposed to make it to 17 and he turn he

459
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,850
just turned 20 so that's a great report

460
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,830
however not you know we don't get that

461
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:52,169
with everybody he was on gemcitabine and

462
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:55,099
Taxotere there is a record in the

463
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:58,170
literature of mice with pancreatic cell

464
00:18:55,099 --> 00:19:00,000
Xena graphs that have gems that when

465
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,640
they take gemcitabine and cannabinoids

466
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,890
there's a synergistic effect so for him

467
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,210
I wanted I wanted to do that but by the

468
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,910
way I'll just share with you I had a

469
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,460
young lady come in 14 years old with

470
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:15,630
stage 4 osteosarcoma with visible tumors

471
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:19,079
coming out of her legs and her father

472
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:21,920
misheard my dosing and when I said 500

473
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,179
per day he thought I said 500 per dose

474
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,220
but I will tell you already

475
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:29,250
everything is shrinking and it's been

476
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,860
maybe eight weeks now well when they

477
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:34,230
emailed me so she has hurt her she had a

478
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:37,019
lung tumor that was inoperable that was

479
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:40,860
12 centimeters it's down to 8 the two

480
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:42,629
leg large tumors are no longer lighting

481
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:48,178
up on the nuclear scans

482
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:49,799
and she came off oxygen off opiates got

483
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,830
up and started walking around so there

484
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:54,028
are sometimes cases I'll be honest with

485
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:56,329
you these are somebody this is

486
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:59,579
somebody's child that's in my office and

487
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:01,798
the last thing that I'm gonna do is harm

488
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:03,629
them but cannabis and high doses is not

489
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,460
going to harm a child we can always stop

490
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,159
it so I figure especially because so

491
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:12,690
many cases come in so late why wouldn't

492
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:14,700
you try I'll throw in a little on the

493
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,528
cancer side too one of them one of the

494
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,710
first gigs I had in the in the cannabis

495
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:24,058
industry was helping a company up scale

496
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:27,259
scale up who basically did a lot of

497
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:30,359
cancer treatments and they were rather

498
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:32,788
inflexible in their protocol but they

499
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,829
were using about a gram a day and I was

500
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:36,569
great great to hear Dustin here say that

501
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:39,028
and Bonnie that you don't need

502
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,859
necessarily a gram a day but if you're

503
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:42,659
using a gram a day to treat cancer you

504
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:44,490
got to know that that's chemo like

505
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:47,220
you're gonna be sick you're gonna be

506
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:50,038
wiped out a Cox inhibitor by the whale

507
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,389
help with some of the side effects but

508
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:53,970
like you're gonna need somebody to take

509
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:56,069
care of you so I saw people have

510
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,399
remarkable recoveries in 12 to 24 weeks

511
00:20:56,069 --> 00:21:01,439
I also saw people die because they this

512
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:03,750
company insisted that they couldn't use

513
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,120
anything else any other drugs which is

514
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,579
not an intelligent way to go what was

515
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,589
the topical topical is just what kind of

516
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:13,199
have you seen any systemic benefits from

517
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:15,928
topicals than local so there's a

518
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,808
physician in on the East Coast named dr.

519
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:20,490
Deborah Kym Ellis who is actually got

520
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:22,950
some interesting case studies on using

521
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:26,339
topicals for cancer which makes you

522
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:29,460
think about dosing because certainly if

523
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:32,099
if the effects of the topicals are to

524
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,919
reduce the cancer if it's a direct

525
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:36,408
effect then that's pretty low dose you

526
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,090
can just can't absorb that much

527
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:40,350
cannabinoid through your skin so it's

528
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,119
definitely interesting is something that

529
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:44,490
should be checked out I do know a case

530
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:47,869
actually in my land in Southern Oregon

531
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:51,569
where a guy was using really tiny doses

532
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:55,528
of THC I think it was under 20

533
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:56,339
milligrams a day and had stopped a liver

534
00:21:55,528 --> 00:21:58,950
cancer

535
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,689
and had when I was four years into his

536
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,200
treatment it was it had been a Stage

537
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,840
four

538
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,460
so there's lots of anecdotal stuff out

539
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,439
there there's some direct clinical

540
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,700
experience here there's definitely

541
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,860
something to think about but I think

542
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,440
topical check out Deborah Kim Ellis I

543
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:18,479
think she's got a website what's that

544
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,170
she's in Maryland thank you and I think

545
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,539
she's got a topical company No one last

546
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,279
thing is the report that I talked about

547
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:28,200
from GW pharmaceutical where they

548
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,170
combined team Adar with CBD and THC

549
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:42,720
those are not high doses they used low

550
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:47,039
doses in that report hi so I just wanted

551
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,160
to ask about applications of of cannabis

552
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,490
for acute pain I know of course it seems

553
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,640
to suit well for chronic pain but with

554
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:59,460
acute pain my understanding is that it

555
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,040
can magnify that can you speak to like

556
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,650
what kind of protocol and dosage you may

557
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:08,579
suggest for acute pain if it is at all a

558
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:10,680
good match for that so topical cannabis

559
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:13,139
is an excellent first aid remedy for

560
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,539
acute pain even in the naive user I

561
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,930
think it's great on beestings and other

562
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:21,329
things like that this really needs to be

563
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:25,080
framed in some ways as a first aid kind

564
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:29,189
of a home remedy but systemic use in a

565
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:32,009
naive user THC can absolutely exacerbate

566
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:34,559
acute pain less likely to do so in

567
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:37,140
someone that is an experienced THC user

568
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,569
and I don't think there's much data on

569
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:43,470
CBD for acute pain and I haven't seen it

570
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:44,029
used that way very much thank you thank

571
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,920
you

572
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:49,500
hi Derek Johnson physician from Park

573
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,180
City Utah thank you all for sharing your

574
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,259
knowledge with us today we touched

575
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,490
briefly on perinatal exposure and based

576
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:00,210
on the current literature I'm just

577
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:02,609
curious as to how you all are counseling

578
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:05,700
your patients who are either pregnant

579
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:07,979
and using or new moms who are either

580
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,669
using or interested in using

581
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:14,970
sure so you know number one is really

582
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:16,919
document this clearly and copy the OB

583
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,538
team with your chart notes and a letter

584
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,700
and everything but you know the way I

585
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:23,009
think about it is in a couple different

586
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,899
categories so there's the women that are

587
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:26,369
doing really well using cannabis to

588
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:28,469
treat a chronic condition that then

589
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:30,268
become pregnant right and in that

590
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,860
situation we have to weigh the risks and

591
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,870
benefits of removing this current

592
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:36,000
treatment what the alternatives might be

593
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:38,129
and what their risk is for mom and baby

594
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,630
and you know I I think these categories

595
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,880
have kind of been done away with but we

596
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,590
might consider cannabis like a category

597
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,320
C medication or maybe somewhere in

598
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:48,599
between B and C when it comes to

599
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,918
pregnancy so you know one example we

600
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,719
could talk about which is probably more

601
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,080
the two most common would be chronic

602
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,548
pain and PTSD right so if a mom is doing

603
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,980
really well treating her chronic pain

604
00:24:56,548 --> 00:25:00,538
and PTSD she becomes pregnant and then

605
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,558
we want to remove the cannabis what are

606
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:04,798
our other options

607
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:06,359
well how about NSAIDs in Tylenol not

608
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,730
great you know for pain

609
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,469
how about opioids in pregnancy not great

610
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,319
neonatal abstinence syndrome right

611
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:15,778
cannabis does not cause na yes let's

612
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:19,980
look at PTSD more mild treatment might

613
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:22,349
be SSRIs those do cause any neonatal

614
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,480
abstinence syndrome and they're not very

615
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:26,609
effective so then what are we left with

616
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,769
the benzodiazepines and other inXile it

617
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:31,408
exciting the risk benefit ratio favors

618
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:33,480
the cannabis over the benzodiazepines so

619
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:35,549
that's that's how you kind of work it in

620
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,288
the assessment and really spell it out

621
00:25:35,548 --> 00:25:39,690
that there's already a level of efficacy

622
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:42,148
and what we're going to do is make sure

623
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,980
that it's there's no combustion so mom's

624
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:45,898
not inhaling smoke we're using the

625
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,669
lowest effective dose we're avoiding

626
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:50,099
tolerance building which means we're

627
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,570
avoiding causing a dysregulation of the

628
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:53,819
endocannabinoid system and we're gonna

629
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:56,730
follow this mom and monitor her and then

630
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:58,798
be extraordinarily vigilant when it

631
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,899
comes to the perinatal period because

632
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,940
you do not want an interruption of

633
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:05,398
bonding and initiation of breastfeeding

634
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,080
which will happen when Child Protective

635
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:09,209
Services gets involved because some

636
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,849
nurse is concerned about THC in the

637
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,380
urine drug screen so I very vigilant

638
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:16,230
around that time make sure it's in the

639
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,179
birth plan that THC is not going to be

640
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,038
tested for in the urine because the

641
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,470
results are clinically irrelevant just

642
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,259
do

643
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:26,169
test that's that's I mean it requires a

644
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:27,609
lot of work in communication but you can

645
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:29,740
do it successfully so then the other

646
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:31,058
case is someone with morning sickness

647
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,589
and no we're not going to just say oh

648
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:34,089
you've got my own morning sickness why

649
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:36,158
don't you try cannabis it's more like

650
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:38,109
why don't you try ginger right and try

651
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,690
changing your diet but when it's

652
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:42,609
hyperemesis gravidarum that's refractory

653
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,890
to antiemetics and we're considering a

654
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:47,048
PICC line which is the more favorable

655
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,669
risk benefit ratio cannabis or the PICC

656
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:51,308
line I mean it's it's not rocket science

657
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:54,299
but it requires a lot of work and

658
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:54,298
advocacy and education

659
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:03,959
I'm just gonna share with you I had to

660
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:08,140
take care of a woman who had bipolar

661
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,259
she's been my patient for probably ten

662
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:13,900
years and she came in pregnant and she

663
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:16,538
said to me I'm terrified of talking to

664
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,370
my OB about using cannabis so we

665
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:20,980
actually called the OB right there and

666
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:23,259
then during the appointment and the OB

667
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,960
was actually quite lovely about it and

668
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:27,849
what they said was that now that they

669
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,460
know what they're gonna do is counsel

670
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:31,869
her and they felt that it was important

671
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,400
to tell her that they would prefer that

672
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:35,798
she didn't use this but that they were

673
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,880
not going to drug test her at the time

674
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:42,158
that the baby was delivered because we

675
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,380
had made this phone call and because it

676
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,870
was now documented and because there was

677
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,940
a reason for her to be using medical

678
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:51,399
reason and she was medically approved it

679
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,529
wasn't the same as someone who was not a

680
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,820
medical patient so I think that was very

681
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:59,529
helpful the communication is huge and I

682
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:01,629
think we're out of questions and right

683
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:05,558
on time thank you all for sticking

684
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,210
around for the whole day amazing let's

685
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,918
see before you get up and leave I want

686
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,870

687
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,259
sign has anyone not signed in for the

688
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:15,939
