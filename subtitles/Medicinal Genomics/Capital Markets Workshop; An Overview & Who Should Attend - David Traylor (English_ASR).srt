2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,839
yeah and so I guess kind of to tie it

3
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:20,799
back all back to the uh the workshop

4
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,240
here so is that really sort of who

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,480
you're tailoring this this content for

6
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:30,320
is sort of the the small company who is

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,079
is starting up and is looking into some

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,960
of these novel compounds and they're

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,558
looking for funding they can come to the

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,200
workshop and kind of learn some best

11
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,359
practices to the best way to to get some

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,800
funding no actually it's meant to go

13
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,439
across the Spectrum it's meant to reach

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,919
out to biotech companies they meant to

15
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,320
reach out to Pharma companies they meant

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,000
to reach out to small companies it's

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,159
meant to reach out to PNG you know

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,039
companies that are not biotech or faral

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,078
Orient are out on the outside looking in

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
because what we've all been about GP

21
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,198
Golden Eagle partners has always been

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,000
about Ben is is help TR providing you

23
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,319
know trying to find the best capital for

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,359
the best companies whether it's inside

25
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,039
or outside of cannabis and that also

26
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,000
means to be the purveyor of objective

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,240
information to a lot of these companies

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,319
that are on the outside looking in that

29
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,839
don't understand the sector and frankly

30
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,758
we understand it better than a lot of

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,719
people and and Frankly Speaking whether

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,799
it's a big company or small company and

33
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:27,118
they want to get into cannabis the

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,720
smartest thing that they could do is

35
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,200
come to Golden Neagle partners and say

36
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,158
what should we do instead of trying to

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,759
go in there and throw a lot of money at

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,040
it and lose it because I can guarantee

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,719
you one thing that's for sure in

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,600
cannabis there's been a lot of money

41
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,759
lost by people that have been too

42
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,000
arrogant and with too little arrogance

43
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,799
and too much too too much arrogance and

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,319
too little humility it's a fact so if if

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,840
companies want to understand the

46
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,919
Cannabis sector better especially where

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,200
the science is going then yeah they

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,960
would be prudent to show up at the the

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,960
Cal markets

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
