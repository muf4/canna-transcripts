1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,459
now we've got the backdrop for our

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,669
bodies endocannabinoid system a

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:13,370
self-healing self-regulatory system this

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:17,039
concept of network pharmacology complex

5
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:19,948
interactions and hopefully letting go of

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,320
some of the need to understand all that

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,730
complexity in a reductionistic way but

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,039
feeling a little more comfortable

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,618
zooming out and understanding that the

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,179
future of medicine and the past may be

11
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:35,909
these complex botanical medicines used

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:39,808
appropriately and I really believe and

13
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:42,390
am seeing now that cannabis is the

14
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:45,628
gateway cannabis is leading medicine

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,480
back to greater comfort with a botanical

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:53,280
treatment greater comfort with multi

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:55,140
Constituent treatment and and complexity

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,480
levels of complexity that we don't fully

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,030
understand yet are comfortable enough

20
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,319
with because of the safety profile to

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,728
use in our patients so let's dig into

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,829
cannabis or actually specifically

23
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,769
cannabinoid pharmacology the following

24
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:13,950
lecture will address the terpenes and so

25
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:16,769
here we have the flower the compound

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,049
flower of cannabis sativa and if we zoom

27
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:22,349
in a little bit more we see the

28
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,049
trichomes these are resin glands present

29
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:27,059
on the little flowering structures and

30
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,259
this is where all the magic happens

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,420
these are factories of dozens hundreds

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,079
of compounds that have physiologic

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,939
activity and so just zooming in you know

34
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,209
the things that we're focused most on

35
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,639
would be the THC in the CBD and of

36
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:47,849
course as dr. Michelin pointed out this

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,460
morning very low levels of THC and CBD

38
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:53,309
are found in the raw cannabis flower

39
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,828
it's actually the THC a and the CBD a

40
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,618
the acidic forms and you can see that

41
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:00,959
little carboxylic acid moiety and the

42
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,569
molecules there and those were

43
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,639
considered the inactive forms of these

44
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,539
compounds for a long time and now

45
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,330
they're starting to gain some

46
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,300
recognition but of course raw

47
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,460
or very slightly heated preparations of

48
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,560
cannabis have been used in medicine for

49
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,110
a very long time so we're gonna dig in a

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,509
THC and CBD first and then we'll take a

51
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,470
tour of some of the other cannabinoid

52
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:28,469
compounds so THC is a partial agonist at

53
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:32,400
the cb1 and cb2 receptor much like

54
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:34,889
Ananda mind THC very closely mimics the

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,020
activity of our endocannabinoids and

56
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,419
probably the biggest difference is that

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,150
when someone is exposed to th see this

58
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:45,179
exogenous vital cannabinoid they end up

59
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,039
with a global cannabinoid effect right

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,590
it's going to be distributed into all

61
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,479
the tissues and affect them systemically

62
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:57,240
I'm just gonna try to get this a little

63
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:59,280
closer compared to compared to when our

64
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,230
bodies make an and amide it's done in a

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,349
very specific manner and it has very

66
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:09,060
short term activity but the effects of

67
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:11,430
THC analgesic antipruritic agonist at CB

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,459
1 excuse me bronchodilator a neuro

69
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,620
protective anti-inflammatory antiemetic

70
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,180
and then of course the psychoactive but

71
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,020
that's just to name a few really

72
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,780
anything that cb1 and cb2 can do THC can

73
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,450
do now that's probably the most

74
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,379
clinically relevant function of THC but

75
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:34,469
a lot of people aren't aware the THC is

76
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:36,389
extraordinarily active or promiscuous if

77
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:38,580
you would say at other targets we don't

78
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,919
know how relevant some of these targets

79
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,590
are but THC activates two other

80
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,238
g-protein couple receptors that are at

81
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,849
least peripherally involved in the

82
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:52,319
endocannabinoid system that's 18 and 55

83
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:54,269
P power gamma trip a one trip v two trip

84
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,579
III and Trippi before so notice the

85
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,820
absence of trip v1 which is the

86
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,560
capsaicin receptor but THC is active at

87
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,500
other receptors in this Vanna Lloyd

88
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,199
system and then THC has some receptor

89
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,449
inhibition activity as well again these

90
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,399
show up mostly in in-vitro work we don't

91
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,709
know how clinically relevant they are

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,620
but they probably some of them are in

93
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:20,069
some situations THC also has a lot of

94
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,660
effects actually enhancing or decreasing

95
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,860
the activity of various enzymes

96
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,110
throughout the body

97
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,509
again not really sure how clinically

98
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,870
relevant but I like to point out what we

99
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,729
don't know because I think that helps us

100
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,889
helps us prevent ourselves from assuming

101
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:38,038
we know everything there's a lot going

102
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:41,658
on with just THC THC is also inhibiting

103
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:45,449
or enhancing transporters of various

104
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:47,598
neuro trend yeah you will you can see

105
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,389
there adenosine dopamine noradrenaline

106
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:53,279
serotonin so the transport of these from

107
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:56,759
the synapse back into the cell can be

108
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,769
enhanced or inhibited by THC it's a lot

109
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,960
going on there with THC although it's

110
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:04,348
probably mostly this partial agonist

111
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,388
effect it's cb1 and cb2 now CBD is quite

112
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:08,938
different it has a lot of overlap with

113
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,918
THC in its clinical effects both can

114
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,259
help with pain both can help with

115
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,750
anxiety with inflammation and so forth

116
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,569
and it's interesting that CBD does not

117
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,300
directly act upon the main targets of

118
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:23,669
THC the cb1 and cb2 receptors it has

119
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,838
very low affinity for those receptors

120
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:31,109
and in fact it acts as a non-competitive

121
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:32,699
inverse agonist so a competitive agonist

122
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,069
or a full agonist is something that

123
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,620
would just completely block the activity

124
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,479
of either THC or the endocannabinoids at

125
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,120
this receptor we have a molecule that

126
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,848
does this called Ramana bent very useful

127
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,370
in research it was actually approved as

128
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:49,288
a drug given to people in Europe they

129
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,538
experienced severe side effects

130
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:54,088
including dysphoria depression and

131
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:56,430
suicide and so it was polled the goal

132
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:59,399
with Ramana Banta as a therapeutic agent

133
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,158
was to limit the munchies and actually

134
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:05,008
be an anti obesity drug but it limited a

135
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:06,688
lot more than the munchies CBD is very

136
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,389
different from that it doesn't block the

137
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:10,759
cb1 receptor as you can if you can see

138
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,918
in the bottom image there it's

139
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,468
interacting at an allosteric site so the

140
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,930
anandam ID the two AG the THC could

141
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:20,759
still bind to the receptor but the

142
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,588
signal that comes out of this receptor

143
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,110
is turned down so CBD is basically

144
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:28,288
turning down the volume of the activity

145
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,449
of these cb1 agonists and likely cb2 as

146
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:32,839
well even though that's not super clear

147
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:35,030
yet but that's not

148
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,859
exactly how CVD is that's not the only

149
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:39,019
way that CVD is working and I think a

150
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,439
lot of the benefits that we attribute to

151
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:44,629
CVD are not based on this negative

152
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,490
allosteric modulation of cb1 and cb2

153
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:49,129
they're based on these other targets

154
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:52,490
especially the 5-htt one a serotonin

155
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:55,009
receptor which is likely the mechanism

156
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,439
of CBDs anti-nausea properties and

157
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,779
probably some of its mood boosting

158
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,490
properties as well as some of its

159
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,529
ability to protect the central nervous

160
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,389
system after an insult because

161
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:09,679
interacting with that receptor can

162
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:13,009
improve vascular supply to damaged areas

163
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,709
the trip v1 through trip v4 and that

164
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,719
includes the trip v1 capsaicin receptor

165
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:19,969
which is a great target for pain

166
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,340
inflammation in some psychiatric illness

167
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,460
p-per gamma has been mentioned several

168
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,709
times today also the glycine receptor

169
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:30,529
which has implications for pain and then

170
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,969
CBD antagonizes a variety of receptors

171
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:35,029
we don't have to go through them all and

172
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:37,340
it inhibits the transporter reuptake of

173
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,379
various neurotransmitters and if you

174
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:42,769
notice the bottom one there anand amide

175
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:45,699
which is quite important so i'll CBD is

176
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:50,689
turning down the volume at cb1 and cb2

177
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:52,699
as well it's also enhancing the activity

178
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,250
of an animai by keeping it around in the

179
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:58,399
synapse by inhibiting its reuptake and

180
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,199
also weakly inhibiting foul which is the

181
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,859
enzyme that breaks down anonymized so

182
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,569
actually two different mechanisms of

183
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,930
increasing in an amide activity which

184
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,490
would then enhance cb1 signaling so CVD

185
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,189
is kind of working on cv one in two

186
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,620
different directions here and then CBD

187
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:17,389
also has activity in the mitochondria

188
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,978
which is interesting we didn't have time

189
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,930
to mention it this morning but the

190
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:25,038
mitochondria have cannabinoid receptors

191
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,269
as well and so much of medicine is now

192
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,019
starting to look at mitochondrial

193
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:31,490
function as a major player and

194
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:33,528
neurologic illness and chronic disease

195
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,778
and I think the cannabinoid system has

196
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:38,450
some things to offer us there but to tie

197
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:40,939
this all up with CBD we see these

198
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,919
antispasmodic a Ning Xia lytic an

199
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,410
antidepressant and so forth no

200
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:50,059
protective effects just a base

201
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:53,328
summary slide and my experience CBD

202
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:55,909
works the best in combination with THC

203
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:58,628
this is where it really shines as a

204
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:01,639
standalone agent a single molecule

205
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:03,649
pharmaceutical CBD absolutely has some

206
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,629
power but it really in the context of

207
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:08,120
some of the other aspects of the plant

208
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,670
in particular THC CBD works well why

209
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,610
because it antagonize --is some of the

210
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:15,948
side effects of THC while enhancing some

211
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:19,129
of the benefits of THC basically widens

212
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:21,859
the therapeutic window of THC when used

213
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:24,019
together in it even decreases the

214
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,959
appetite of effects of THC for those

215
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:29,269
worried about the munchies again we

216
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:33,099
don't need Romana bands to help us with

217
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:36,019
that but I will mention that that hasn't

218
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:41,089
this idea that CBD kind of limits the

219
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:42,709
high of THC is likely the case to some

220
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,720
extent but it doesn't show up that

221
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,309
clearly in all the literature there's

222
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,560
kind of mixed results so I just want to

223
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:51,049
paint a picture that's not black or

224
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,919
white this was a study that showed that

225
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:57,769
administering fairly generous doses of

226
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,708
CBD at 90 minutes before smoking fairly

227
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:02,568
weak cannabis cigarettes containing THC

228
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,129
night is supplied you can see it's like

229
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:07,610
5% THC

230
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:09,588
by weight it didn't it basically didn't

231
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,870
make people say that they were not high

232
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:14,420
it didn't work like that I don't know

233
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,360
based on this study if a oral dose of

234
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:19,549
CBD administer prior to THC smoking will

235
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,560
diminish the high you can see really no

236
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:25,099
difference in the results what it did

237
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,859
diminish though was the in the adverse

238
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,980
aspects of the psychoactive effects the

239
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,930
anxiety and the paranoia and the

240
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:36,019
uncomfortable feeling I suspect that a

241
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:38,299
lot of the UV phoria and the inXile Isis

242
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,100
and the other desirable psychoactive

243
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:43,099
properties of THC are able to shine

244
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,980
through even a very high dose of CBD

245
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,170
administered beforehand but when we look

246
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,709
at the really severe adverse effects of

247
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:55,159
THC like an acute psychotic experience

248
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:56,379
CBD actually does seem to limit that so

249
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,319
this is from

250
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:01,059
McCallum and Rousseau from a couple

251
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,640
years ago their paper on dosing which

252
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:06,099
was well done looking at kind of the the

253
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,939
threshold for toxic psychosis of marinol

254
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:14,110
which is just a pure THC drug was about

255
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,550
18 milligrams and it's shows it pretty

256
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,100
small here so I can't quite see it but

257
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:21,129
if I remember correctly a combination of

258
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,230
approximately one to one CBD and THC the

259
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:26,139
threshold for toxic psychosis was around

260
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,170
50 milligrams so half of that would be

261
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:32,259
25 so basically in the presence of an

262
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:35,740
equal quantity of CBD the threshold for

263
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:37,840
psychosis from THC went from 18 up to 25

264
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,460
and you can see that's widening the

265
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,850
therapeutic index someone could tolerate

266
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,139
more without experience this severe

267
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,360
experiencing 'no severe side effects so

268
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,319
these two do go very well together and I

269
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,500
think we have more to learn about

270
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,200
exactly how they interact and how they

271
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,259
work together but this this story is not

272
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,780
just about CBD and THC this plant is

273
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:00,519
just a treasure trove of phyto

274
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,519
constituents that have therapeutic

275
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:06,340
activities many cannabinoids terpenes

276
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,970
the acidic s-- and then also important

277
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,610
to remember as Kevin mentioned earlier

278
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,139
that plants figure this out a long time

279
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,330
ago since they can't run away from

280
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,090
predators how do they defend themselves

281
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,460
it's it's with these factories so the

282
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,070
trichomes are on the female reproductive

283
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,590
structures of cannabis the structures

284
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,050
that are going to be the most vulnerable

285
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:33,100
to damage from ultraviolet and other

286
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:35,439
accidents to pests molds invaders and so

287
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,779
these antimicrobial and antioxidant

288
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,730
properties that the plant is producing

289
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,740
these compounds to achieve in the plant

290
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,860
they are also conveyed to people who

291
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,970
take these as anti microbials and

292
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:51,490
antioxidants so moving along cbn just

293
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,279
some of the pharmacology it binds to CB

294
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,560
2 a little bit better than CB 1 in both

295
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,350
cases it's less potent to tea less

296
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:02,829
potent than THC but very similar to THC

297
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,019
now CBN is not produced by the plant per

298
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:09,200
se but it's an oxidative breakdown

299
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:10,850
product of THC so especially in regions

300
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,100
where there's a lot of humidity and you

301
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,500
would traditionally dry the cannabis

302
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,200
flowers out in the Sun that ultraviolet

303
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,629
light will convert some of the THC into

304
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,879
CBN and that gives the flower a bit of a

305
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:26,090
different quality mildly sedated

306
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,710
according to a report in 1976 I think a

307
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,050
lot of people in the cannabis field

308
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,480
assume that CBN is sedating and I think

309
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:34,370
for some people it is but there what

310
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,680
I've observed is a lot of inter

311
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,299
individual variability where CBN does

312
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,339
seem to help some people sleep and it

313
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:42,379
seems to wake some people up and there's

314
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,330
probably dozens of factors in there

315
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:46,789
including the oxidation of the other

316
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,580
components that nobody's looking at that

317
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:50,539
we're not really considering

318
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,870
anti-inflammatory properties and also

319
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:56,929
antibiotic properties including opponent

320
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,889
agent against mersa antibiotic

321
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:03,169
resistance not resistant to cbn and some

322
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,350
of the other cannabinoids as well so

323
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:09,860
moving on to CBG we have very low

324
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:12,710
activity at cb1 and cb2 it does activate

325
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:16,730
the trip v and the trip a receptors and

326
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:19,370
the alpha-2 adrenergic that's the

327
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,500
adrenal scepter like clonidine and

328
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,200
guanfacine so clonidine used for

329
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,230
treating blood pressure but also a very

330
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,570
valuable some paths oolitic guanfacine

331
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,250
which is and has less of the blood

332
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,400
pressure effects but used more for

333
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,049
attention deficit so perhaps CBG will

334
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,029
emerge is something that can help with

335
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:40,069
that by suppressing excessive

336
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:41,959
sympathetic activity do any of your

337
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:48,610
patients have excessive sympathetic

338
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:51,430
activity do any of you inhibits a

339
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,840
variety of receptors as well also

340
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:56,299
antineoplastic antimicrobial and anti

341
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,230
depressant effects and there may be some

342
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:02,479
evidence that CBC in the presence of th

343
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:05,450
so you can actually potentiate the THC

344
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,889
to some extent and I have had reports

345
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,259
that varieties that contain a little

346
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:11,929
more CBC than typical seem more

347
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:14,419
psychoactive but that's not due to the

348
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:18,319
CBC that's due to enhanced THC activity

349
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:21,740
then we have THC v which is a cb-one

350
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,470
antagonist at low doses but a cb1

351
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,289
agonist at higher doses could this plant

352
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,710
throw us at any more curveballs

353
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:32,659
hopefully yes but this is an interesting

354
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:36,350
one so at these low doses this could

355
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:39,250
also be an anti Munchie drug so to speak

356
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,990
because of this gentle antagonism

357
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,480
producing weight loss decreased body fat

358
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,029
and decreased leptin concentrations

359
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,600
increased energy expenditure at least in

360
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:52,909
mice has anticonvulsant properties

361
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,480
decreased edema and hyperalgesia in a

362
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:58,549
mouse model and also it lacks the

363
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,639
adverse effect liabilities of your

364
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:04,219
typical in inverse agonist like ramana

365
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,409
Bant it does not cause that dysphoria

366
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,500
and that dysregulation of the no

367
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:11,659
cannabinoid system as far as we know

368
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:15,139
moving on to some of the acidic ste HCA

369
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:18,529
is none psychoactive but I will say that

370
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:21,220
anytime there is any THC a present there

371
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:24,169
is always at least a tiny bit of THC

372
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,269
some of the earlier work on THC a was

373
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:29,509
very confounded because some researchers

374
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:31,220
found that it's got some cb1 stimulating

375
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:33,620
activity and some researchers found it

376
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,750
didn't and it was kind of confusing but

377
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,330
there's no such thing as a pure THC a

378
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:41,509
standard even the most pure will have a

379
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:44,330
small amount of THC in it that was shown

380
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:46,850
by McPartland a few years ago but not

381
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,980
psychoactive nevertheless a strong

382
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,620
inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha

383
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,399
release which is a major inflammatory

384
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:58,070
component of a chronic disease

385
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,049
anti-cancer effects also it's at least

386
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,230
to some extent via the P PI receptors

387
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:06,649
and it has some inhibitory activity at

388
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:09,170
trip m8 activating trip a one-in trip

389
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,720
before and and some of these other

390
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,789
cation channels so that's

391
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,720
THCA in my practice i found it very

392
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:19,399
useful for treating arthritis it takes a

393
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,250
little bit longer for people to respond

394
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,439
to it because it's not an analgesic per

395
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,420
se it's an anti-inflammatory but usually

396
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,860
at the two or four week mark people are

397
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,279
starting to notice a difference and I

398
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:33,079
usually am recommending it via T because

399
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,039
there's not a lot of THC a products

400
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,740
available and I think can

401
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:40,220
he is a really great delivery method

402
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:44,390
moving on to CB da the CB da is much

403
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:46,670
more similar to CB d than th CA is to

404
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,820
THC if you look at the pharmacology of

405
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:52,250
THC a and THC they're very distinct CBD

406
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:54,589
a has a lot of overlap with CBD and it

407
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:58,519
seems to be more powerful it activates

408
00:17:54,589 --> 00:18:01,490
the 5-htt 1a serotonin receptor but much

409
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:06,049
more strongly does not seem to act on

410
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:08,750
the CB 1 or cb2 receptors so as we

411
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:11,180
described before in many situations it's

412
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,900
valuable to get that negative allosteric

413
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:17,330
modulation of cb1 and cb2 in order to

414
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,150
make people tolerate their THC better

415
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:22,399
but that's not always what we're looking

416
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,190
for sometimes we want the full power of

417
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,220
THC to shine through yet we also want

418
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,350
some CBD like effects and the mix and in

419
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,140
my opinion that's where CBD a comes in

420
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:35,480
because it can convey many of CBDs

421
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,970
beneficial qualities at a much lower

422
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,269
dose without the negative allosteric

423
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:45,920
modulation of cb1 and cb2 so that's a

424
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:47,720
strategy to consider CBD a is also with

425
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,170
the only cannabinoid that's a strong

426
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,819
cox-2 inhibitor and again we don't know

427
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,769
if CBD a would share some of the

428
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:58,039
liabilities and side-effects of some of

429
00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:00,079
the other cox-2 inhibition drugs and

430
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,359
when used at high doses I would be

431
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,519
cautious with some of the other problems

432
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,349
like gastrointestinal and cardiovascular

433
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,049
but the beautiful thing about it is we

434
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:11,659
don't need to use it in high doses so

435
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:14,960
here's a little data from 2013 in a

436
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,100
rodent model of nausea they're counting

437
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,670
something called gapes

438
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:23,289
because these rodents don't vomit they

439
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:25,580
they just gag and so you can count them

440
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:28,069
after administering a high dose of

441
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:30,740
lithium chloride which would make most

442
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:33,529
of us gag and see what the antiemetic

443
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:36,200
activity is and so I point out the

444
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:38,930
increased efficacy of THC a compared to

445
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,789
th see the this dosing here on the

446
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:44,720
bottom you can see it's milligrams per

447
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:46,059
kilogram so point zero five milligrams

448
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,819
per kilogram of tea

449
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:51,639
see a a tiny tiny dose even for humans

450
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:54,730
especially tiny for rodents suppress

451
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,759
their nausea ten times that dose of THC

452
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:00,460
a didn't make it any better but it

453
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,470
really was ten times that dose of THC

454
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,750
that was required to even show some

455
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:09,250
effect so there was no effect of THC Oh

456
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:11,440
point zero five it was 0.5 0.5 of THC

457
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,680
where you began to see the effect so 10x

458
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,539
the potency at least on THC a how did

459
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,509
these researchers know to look in these

460
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:21,759
very low dosing ranges of THC a I'm not

461
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,680
sure I'll tell just a quick story about

462
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,230
THC a because I've been looking at the

463
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:29,500
very low dosing range of it for a while

464
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:35,170
for about five years now with great

465
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:36,940
surprise still so back in 2013 as many

466
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,830
of you are aware Sanjay Gupta came out

467
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,710
with his first documentary weeds and

468
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:43,629
people were you know looking for CBD to

469
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,480
treat their seizures and their kids

470
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,550
especially and at the time we had just

471
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,799
started a cannabis analytic laboratory

472
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:53,289
in my clinical practice and I was very

473
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,210
excited when a patient came in and said

474
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:57,519
I got this bottle of CBD from the

475
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,950
dispensary and it's working my daughter

476
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,389
seizures are way down and I said well

477
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,100
yeah and I had heard that story a couple

478
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,100
times before but this was the first

479
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:07,809
chance I had to really find out what the

480
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:10,119
dosage was because back then there was

481
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:12,759
no labeling no testing we were the first

482
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,739
analytic lab in our state and so I

483
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:17,170
grabbed a bottle and we took a little

484
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,359
sample of it we ran it through the HPLC

485
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,850
and I was expecting to find out how much

486
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,240
CBD this kid was getting the answer was

487
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:25,059
zero

488
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,019
there was no CBD in that bottle there

489
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:32,950
was pretty much no THC in that bottle it

490
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:35,259
was a very weak glycerate of THC a that

491
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,140
was the only peak that was significant

492
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:41,109
in their THC a and the kid was getting

493
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,670
such a low dose I had a very hard time

494
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:45,159
believing that that was working for

495
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,960
seizures but but you know I'm not sure

496
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,820
about the placebo effect in cases like

497
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,100
this certainly parental report can be

498
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:53,740
influenced by things that the parent

499
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:55,480
hopes is working and so I didn't really

500
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,859
know what to make out of it except that

501
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,259
the dispensary was selling something

502
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:00,619
that

503
00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:02,329
what they said it was it was some kind

504
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:04,819
of a cannabis oil that didn't get people

505
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:07,490
hi it must be CBD but it was actually

506
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:10,789
just a tea raw cannabis infusion into

507
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,380
glycerin anyways that happened a few

508
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,730
more times and I talked to a few people

509
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,690
around the world that we're seeing the

510
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:20,599
same thing before I believed it THC a

511
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:22,730
has an efficacy range way way down lower

512
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,459
than most people would expect in certain

513
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:28,730
situations then the authors who did that

514
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,860
last study looked at CBD a but notice

515
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:34,250
the scale is different now micrograms

516
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:36,859
per kilogram they went even lower on CBD

517
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,410
a and they found that a half of a

518
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:41,689
microgram per kilogram again that is so

519
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:44,660
small and rodents it's hard to even

520
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,580
describe maybe the equivalent in a human

521
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,320
would be brushing up against a cannabis

522
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:49,159
flower and letting some of that resin

523
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,839
get on your arm

524
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,930
and absorbed through the skin I mean

525
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:56,569
this is tiny tiny dosing reduced nausea

526
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:59,570
in a similar rodent nausea model and

527
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:02,269
here we just have the chart looking at

528
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:04,700
cox-1 and cox-2 in comparison with

529
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:07,970
indomethacin and diclofenac and you can

530
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:11,360
see the big signal and CBD a at the

531
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,309
bottom of the graph there now there has

532
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:17,839
been some anticonvulsant activity

533
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:22,700
reported around THC a way back in 1970

534
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:25,639
what was s in 1974 I think 1979 it was

535
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,610
at very high doses in rodents and again

536
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,520
as you'll learn from the rest of today

537
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:33,139
the cannabinoids are very dichotomous so

538
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,759
you know they they work in very high

539
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,620
doses they work in very low doses

540
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:38,150
there's bi-directional effects and

541
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:41,659
biphasic effects we're going to cover

542
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,340
all of that later but it again doesn't

543
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,800
surprise me that we see some activity

544
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:48,559
against seizures of very high doses and

545
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,089
at extraordinarily low doses now let's

546
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,599
talk about some of the pharmacokinetic

547
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:56,179
properties of THC and how our bodies

548
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,219
deal with this and we know surprisingly

549
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,170
little about the pharmacokinetics and

550
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,450
the metabolism of many of the other

551
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:05,450
cannabinoids but it's likely analogous

552
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,880
to THC where we have the absorption the

553
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,798
concentration into the body fluid we

554
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,049
have

555
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,868
metabolism in the liver and I'll show

556
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:17,148
you some of the metabolites in a future

557
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:18,978
slide and then we have excretion both

558
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:22,028
through the feces and through the urine

559
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:26,749
as well as through the skin and the hair

560
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:29,269
so bioavailability of THC as you can see

561
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:30,889
it ranges quite a bit this is an older

562
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:33,979
study that summarized some of the data

563
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:36,709
that was available but oral by oval

564
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:38,869
bioavailability is pretty low regardless

565
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,819
of what study you look at inhalation

566
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:42,738
gets a bit higher and then there were a

567
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:45,829
couple studies of recto by rectal

568
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:48,348
bioavailability which showed that Hemi

569
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:51,228
succinate preparation was much more

570
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:53,450
bioavailable than a regular suppository

571
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:56,058
and in general worked a little bit

572
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,340
better than oral but let's take a look

573
00:24:56,058 --> 00:25:01,519
at some of these curves so on the left

574
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:03,228
and um and thank you for getting this up

575
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,028
here I appreciate it maybe in the future

576
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:06,470
there is a way to switch this up so that

577
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:08,778
it's a little bigger because the slides

578
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,999
appear quite small on this monitor but

579
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:14,329
you don't have to deal with it now so

580
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:18,139
looking looking on the left I believe we

581
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:20,569
have the oral you guys tell me where are

582
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:23,478
we on the Left chart is this

583
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:28,538
maybe yeah Wow we need some help here

584
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:31,940
has this sorry say it again

585
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:34,190
inhaling okay so oh right inhaling I can

586
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,109
see it now so with the inhaled cannabis

587
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:39,798
you can see the dotted line is the peak

588
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:42,439
of THC and that Peaks very very high

589
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:45,378
early on 15 minutes we give this peak

590
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,859
effect and then it drops rapidly we

591
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:51,199
don't see a lot of 11 hydroxy THC that's

592
00:25:48,858 --> 00:25:53,329
the larger dashed line towards the

593
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,700
bottom because there's not that first

594
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:58,339
pass metabolism with inhaled but over

595
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,919
time what we see is the carboxy THC

596
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:02,178
which is an inactive metabolite and I'll

597
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,788
review those metabolites on the

598
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:07,309
following slide now as we go over to the

599
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:09,259
right we have a different scale on the

600
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:11,808
y-axis so I just want you to note that

601
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:14,839
look what happens when people take THC

602
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:17,210
by mouth the blood level of THC stays

603
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,699
way down do you see it way down there at

604
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,990
the bottom there's a decent level not

605
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,840
not decent I mean

606
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:26,720
slightly higher level of 11 hydroxy THC

607
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:29,089
which is an active metabolite and then

608
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,789
we have this large quantity of the

609
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:34,428
inactive metabolite so we have low oral

610
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:37,730
bioavailability and a lot of first pass

611
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:39,800
metabolism that really ends up making

612
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,319
very low levels of these active

613
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:45,019
constituents in the blood but what I'll

614
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:47,808
say is that the blood levels of these

615
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:49,670
compounds don't correlate directly with

616
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:52,308
the clinical effects and a really good

617
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:56,870
example of that is when people inhale

618
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:58,399
THC their peak blood level of THC occurs

619
00:26:56,869 --> 00:27:00,739
at a different time than the peak

620
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,570
psychoactive experience when they're

621
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,490
peaking psychoactive lis their blood

622
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:06,950
level has already dropped and so you

623
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,589
could give someone that tiny little bump

624
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:12,230
of THC you see in the bottom of the

625
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:14,359
middle chart there and that might feel

626
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,910
stronger than what you're seeing over to

627
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,189
the left as far as a as far as a

628
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,950
psychoactive effect so it's it really

629
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:25,929
doesn't correlate directly and and it's

630
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:46,370
not just psychoactive it's analgesic and

631
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:50,300
anti-inflammatory HC it's very likely to

632
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:52,399
cause psychotic transient experience so

633
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,899
the metabolism of THC is mainly in the

634
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,420
liver but there's extra hepatic

635
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,070
metabolism as well and you can see just

636
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,170
as I've mentioned a few times here

637
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:03,649
there's an 11 hydroxy form that is an

638
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:06,019
active metabolite I think people assume

639
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:08,630
that it's more psychoactive it certainly

640
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:10,549
may be that way for some but I think

641
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,429
it's just qualitatively different people

642
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:16,339
that take cannabis more via an oral

643
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:18,230
mucosal route versus swallowing it would

644
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:19,639
be able to kind of describe some of the

645
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,200
difference between having more

646
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,900
first-pass and less first pass

647
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,000
metabolism and usually there's a

648
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,370
qualitative difference some people say

649
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,289
the first pass you know by swallowing it

650
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:32,509
they get more of a muscle relaxant

651
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:34,579
effect or maybe a more of a body effect

652
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:36,500
less of a cerebral effect

653
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:42,399
and some people say the exact opposite

654
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:44,990
so I'm not sure now here we have CBD

655
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,880
pharmacokinetics very high doses as you

656
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,620
can see unfortunately most of our

657
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,080
patients can't afford 6,000 milligrams

658
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:53,689
but I guess it's worth trying that in a

659
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:56,808
single dose just to see how safe it is

660
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:59,360
which is ridiculous it's that safe but

661
00:28:56,808 --> 00:29:02,269
twice daily dosing it's still very high

662
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:05,959
levels for six days and evaluating the

663
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:08,720
effect of having it after a meal or on

664
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,440
an empty stomach and this was delivered

665
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,660
via the new drug epidemics and so first

666
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,440
of all the adverse effects diarrhea

667
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:20,540
nausea headache and somnolence time to

668
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,789
the maximum plasma concentration was

669
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:25,700
four to five hours it reached a steady

670
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:28,909
state after approximately two days with

671
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:31,130
very moderate accumulation and so

672
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,259
probably some of the time a steady dose

673
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,140
of CBD for even you know we could say

674
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:39,049
maybe three days then we've reached a

675
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,490
steady blood level and I think that's

676
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:43,190
important when we talk later about how

677
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,019
frequently to titrate a dose we wouldn't

678
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,850
want to titrate it one day after the

679
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:49,150
next we want to give that much time for

680
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:52,699
someone to achieve a steady level

681
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,290
half-life 10 to 17 hours no change in

682
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,440
their labs even with the super high

683
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:59,990
doses physical exam vital signs ECG or

684
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,000
body weight no consistent effect on

685
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,269
sleep or sleepiness this shows up a lot

686
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,039
in literature in my experience CBD seems

687
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:09,230
to help some people sleep it seems to

688
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,289
keep some people awake hard to predict

689
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,599
who's gonna be who and no clear evidence

690
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:15,200
of any drug withdrawal syndrome during

691
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,719
the trial

692
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,460
so quite safe and some of the

693
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,769
conclusions or takeaway points

694
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,670
twice-daily administration seems to make

695
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:25,549
sense

696
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:28,730
taken with a high-fat meal you can get 4

697
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:30,379
to 5 fold the oral absorption so that's

698
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,970
probably a good idea to recommend people

699
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,610
to take it after breakfast and after

700
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:36,170
lunch is usually what I'm doing again

701
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:38,500
because sometimes I'm cautious about

702
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:41,210
after dinner in case it keeps them awake

703
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,750
all adverse effects from mild or

704
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,789
moderate

705
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,859
and safety data is consistent with

706
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:48,920
what's currently established we'll skip

707
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:51,419
that little part on the side there so

708
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,710
here's some pharmacokinetics published

709
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,660
for the first time in the last year

710
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,789
about the acidic cannabinoids as you can

711
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,580
imagine I got very excited to see this

712
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:01,319
it confirmed what I was suspecting so

713
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:04,159
the acidic cannabinoids having a

714
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:08,759
carboxylic acid group on there they are

715
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,650
more hydrophilic right there they're a

716
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,529
little more water-soluble and maybe get

717
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,840
better distributed in the body so let's

718
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:19,609
take a look at what happened here first

719
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:22,259
we can see a comparison of THC and CBD

720
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:24,719
when taken in two forms one is a

721
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:26,279
decoction which is like a tea except

722
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,500
it's simmered for a prolonged period of

723
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,869
time while covered and the other is an

724
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,289
oil and you can see that these were

725
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:36,000
so-called bill enok preparations out of

726
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:37,349
Italy some of the studies out of Italy

727
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,170
are looking at the right things but I

728
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:42,299
feel like the rigor of their starting

729
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,640
materials and procedures can be a little

730
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:47,819
weak but I'm so glad they're looking at

731
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,920
THC a and and so you can see that there

732
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:52,019
was some variability especially in the

733
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,820
decoction quite a bit of variability and

734
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:55,559
actually what people were taking but

735
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:58,319
nevertheless some interesting results

736
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:01,259
here some more THC absorbed

737
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:04,769
excuse me more CBD absorbed than THC in

738
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:06,240
the decoction and then over here when we

739
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:10,200
start looking at the acidic s--

740
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,200
so that orange peak that's THC a if

741
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,360
you're looking for the THC peak as far

742
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,069
as what was absorbed you can see it's

743
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:21,929
just way way down there and yeah I could

744
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:23,519
do a better job of exploring explaining

745
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:27,210
if I could actually see it from up here

746
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:30,000
but what I think you'll notice is that a

747
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,460
lot greater absorption of THC a compared

748
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,619
to THC in both the oil and the decoction

749
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,170
and if you look at the top of this slide

750
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,029
you'll see that there were roughly equal

751
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,950
parts right so we're getting much better

752
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:42,809
absorption the other thing that's kind

753
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,250
of flipped on its head and that the

754
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:46,379
studies showed and it's a little hard to

755
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:49,200
see remember the oral dosing a

756
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:52,350
pharmaceutical grade THC we saw higher

757
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,720
levels of 11 hydroxy than we saw of the

758
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:57,959
parent compound THC that

759
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,380
back that's reversed in this so here we

760
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,269
have higher levels of THC than the 11

761
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,700
hydroxy and that's likely because the

762
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:08,069
presence of these other cannabinoids the

763
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,009
acidic cannabinoids is inhibiting some

764
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:12,329
of that first pass metabolism of THC

765
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:15,299
right and that's something that happens

766
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:17,159
a lot in complex botanical medicines is

767
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:19,769
that the variety of compounds with

768
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,759
Sherriff similar structures when they

769
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,740
get to the liver

770
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:24,750
they have pharmacokinetic effects on the

771
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,910
metabolism and can really change well

772
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:29,069
even before it gets the liver can change

773
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,990
the absorption and it can change the

774
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:32,720
metabolism and so it looks like having

775
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:35,789
some of these acidic cannabinoids can

776
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,660
decrease that conversion to 11 hydroxy

777
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:43,500
looking over here at CBD a again we see

778
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:47,670
some really pronounced absorption of CBD

779
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,470
a compared to CBD and this was just some

780
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,450
of the data so you can take a look at

781
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,880
the area under the curves and I did the

782
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:57,390
math for you and so it's looking like

783
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:00,300
THC a versus THC in the decoction was

784
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:03,330
absorbed 50 times better and 30 times

785
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:05,879
better out of an oil and more modest for

786
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:08,880
CBD but still a much higher absorption

787
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,849
for CBD a compared to CBD I'm just going

788
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,410
to wrap up here with a few more slides I

789
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,690
think this is a very important but

790
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:18,539
controversial topic and so I want you to

791
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,429
just be aware of the science that we

792
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:23,099
have behind it right now a good review

793
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:25,519
in the 2017 National Academies of

794
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:29,009
Sciences engineering medicine report

795
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,599
which looked at all the data on infants

796
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:33,260
that had been in children that have been

797
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,909
exposed to cannabinoids perinatally and

798
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:39,600
in prenatally and what they found was

799
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:42,809
that the only consistent finding was

800
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,329
smaller for gestational age this wasn't

801
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:48,269
dangerously small this was an ultra low

802
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:50,579
you know preterm and all that stuff but

803
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:53,280
it was smaller for gestational age which

804
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:54,440
was consistent with any exposure to

805
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,940
smoke

806
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,740
basically when someone's smoking they're

807
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,650
getting carbon monoxide they're getting

808
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:03,989
other chemical compounds that could

809
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,700
interfere with blood supply and other

810
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:07,679
factors in the fetus and cause a

811
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:08,399
slightly smaller baby we see it with

812
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,889
tobacco

813
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,690
as well and so these authors attributed

814
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:16,170
the small-for-gestational-age to the

815
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:18,480
smoke itself not to the cannabinoids and

816
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,088
and that's a very high-level summary

817
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,309
from the 2017 report there were actually

818
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:24,960
just three new studies that came out in

819
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:27,859
the last couple months looking at

820
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,289
cannabis and pregnancy and lactation and

821
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:33,210
their basic conclusion was that all the

822
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:35,039
rest of our data is really unreliable

823
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:37,858
because so much of it is based on

824
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,270
self-report and what one study came out

825
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:42,058
that looked at the difference between

826
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:44,788
self-report and urine toxicology screens

827
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:46,980
and as you can imagine there's a lot of

828
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:48,390
differences there for many good reasons

829
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,108
why moms aren't self reporting in

830
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:54,019
cannabis and why some are not sure and

831
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:56,608
in the current political environment

832
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:58,710
cannabinoids and lactation they are

833
00:35:56,608 --> 00:36:01,858
present in breast milk once an early

834
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:05,429
study from 2013 estimated that the

835
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:08,130
neonate would be exposed to less than 1%

836
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:11,009
of the mothers exposure and that's per

837
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,838
kilogram of body weight so it is getting

838
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:15,390
into the breast milk but the exposure to

839
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,009
the infant is very small a subsequent

840
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:20,659
study found a little bit of a higher

841
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:23,369
result there 2.5% of the maternal dose

842
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:26,368
being delivered to the infant per

843
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:28,349
kilogram of body weight so unless mom's

844
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:31,380
taking a lot it's still very little

845
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:33,180
exposure to the infant but I'm not

846
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,599
saying that so that you assume very

847
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:39,239
little is irrelevant very very small

848
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:41,220
doses of cannabinoids can absolutely be

849
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,689
relevant I don't think we can say right

850
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:45,088
now if this is a good thing or a bad

851
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:48,298
thing because it probably depends on the

852
00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:50,429
situation which is a complex family and

853
00:36:48,298 --> 00:36:52,259
community situation that involves

854
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:54,419
factors like maternal stress and

855
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,430
maternal sleep and some of moms other

856
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,289
health issues and some of the babies

857
00:36:56,429 --> 00:37:00,598
issues and the babies genetics that may

858
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:02,970
relate to the moms health issues and and

859
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,950
all sorts of factors here what we know

860
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:07,048
is that lots of kids have been exposed

861
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:09,149
to cannabis during pregnancy and

862
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:11,429
lactation and they don't develop

863
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,740
differently sometimes there's a little

864
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:16,288
acceleration or a little deceleration of

865
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,179
certain milestones prior to age five but

866
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:20,940
by the time they reach age five it's a

867
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:21,639
wash and so this this doesn't seem like

868
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,159
it's a

869
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:26,699
inherently dangerous for children to be

870
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:30,469
exposed to low levels and that is the

871
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:35,399
cannabinoid pharmacology talk thank you

872
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:35,399
