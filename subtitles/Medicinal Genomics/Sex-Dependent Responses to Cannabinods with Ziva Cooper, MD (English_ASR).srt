Institute of medicine her current

49
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,139
research involves understanding

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,599
variables that influence both the

51
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,059
therapeutic potential and adverse

52
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,639
effects of cannabis and cannabinoids

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,699
through double-blind placebo-controlled

54
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,799
studies one of the variables Ziva and

55
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:37,318
her team are studying is the difference

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,780
between men and women and their response

57
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,060
to the abuse related and pain relieving

58
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,060
effects of cannabinoids and the role

59
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,199
that circulating hormones and

60
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,420
endocannabinoids contribute to these

61
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,238
differences and that's the subject of

62
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,518
our conversation today we talk about the

63
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,340
key differences in how cannabis affects

64
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,120
males versus females how females

65
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,280
metabolize THC differently than males

66
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,620
cannabis use tolerance differences in

67
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,080
males versus females how female

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,340
reproductive hormones play a role in

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,019
sensitivity to THC the importance of

70
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,759
placebo-controlled studies and male

71
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,280
versus female differences in

72
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,179
self-reporting pain side effects and

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,860
more

74
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,900
before we get to my conversation with

75
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,300

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,400
good afternoon Ziva thanks so much for

97
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,860
joining us on the podcast

98
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,839
Ben thanks so much for having me on the

99
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,379
cammed Coffee Talk podcast it's great to

100
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,599
be here all right so today we're talking

101
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,180
about sex differences when it comes to

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,280
cannabis and I got the idea for this

103
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,959
topic because we were gonna I was

104
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,399
excited to have you on the podcast and I

105
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,319
was looking through the many

106
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,659
Publications you've authored and

107
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,139
co-authored and I noticed one of the

108
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,240
most cited is sex dependent effects of

109
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,579
cannabis and cannabinoids a

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,319
translational perspective uh which I

111
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,659
thought would be a great topic to dive

112
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,779
into and I noticed that there are other

113
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,180
papers in your in your repertoire who

114
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,459
that explored sex differences so I I

115
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,978
imagine it's a topic that's that's close

116
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:19,560
to your heart or at least

117
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,839
um very important to you so I guess my

118
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,780
first question to you is why do you feel

119
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:27,359
it's an important topic to explore when

120
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,179
it comes to cannabis

121
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,479
I think in general there's an increasing

122
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,840
awareness of how important it is to look

123
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,418
at both sex and gender effects across

124
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,519
medical research at this point right so

125
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:44,099
it's interesting I was looking at some

126
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,519
some of the landmark cannabis studies

127
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,100
back in the 1970s and all of those

128
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,038
landmark cannabis studies involved only

129
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,439
men between the ages of like 19 and 30

130
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,079
and I just think that you know since

131
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,319
then we've evolved so much

132
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,079
um in our appreciation for really

133
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,719
understanding how

134
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,079
biologically and also culturally how

135
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,120
important it is to understand

136
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,099
across you know pharmacological classes

137
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,019
and across different Medical Health

138
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,960
endpoints

139
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:21,359
um the differences between men and women

140
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,239
are males and females and so you know

141
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,759
cannabis is definitely not any exception

142
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,340
to this and it's especially relevant

143
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,520
given the fact that there's been a sharp

144
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:34,638
increase in cannabis use among females

145
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:38,399
over the last decade and specifically

146
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,800
medical cannabis use so we're starting

147
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,899
to see that a lot more women are

148
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,340
starting to gravitate towards using

149
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:46,918
medical cannabis for specific

150
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:49,799
indications and that even more gives us

151
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,620
you know the real justification and need

152
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,300
to understand the effects of cannabis

153
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,399
and cannabinoids between both men and

154
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,720
women

155
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,399
and understand if there are differences

156
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,979
and why there might be differences

157
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:05,339
between the two sexes

158
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:07,620
great and so what I imagine one of the

159
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,719
main differences could be and you can

160
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,300
tell me if this is the case are there

161
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,360
sex differences when it comes to the

162
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,100
endocannabinoid system

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,098
interesting

164
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:24,599
um so we know that there are

165
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:26,939
fluctuations of endocannabinoids across

166
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:29,939
menstrual cycle phase

167
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,860
um so you know we know that even in

168
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,899
women themselves if you just take them

169
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,379
that their endocannabinoids are going to

170
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:39,079
be changing over the course of of that

171
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:42,360
month at least in

172
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:46,318
premenopausal women we don't actually

173
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,560
know very much about how these how the

174
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,620
fluctuations in in post-menopausal women

175
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,360
and of course this is becoming a area of

176
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,180
Interest especially since a lot of women

177
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,479
are turning two cannabinoid-based

178
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,098
products for

179
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:04,199
perimenopausal symptoms

180
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:08,219
um there's been some documented studies

181
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:11,280
looking at the CB1 receptor in humans

182
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,139
using Imaging techniques and how those

183
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,339
receptors change over time and how there

184
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:19,740
are differences as a function of sex and

185
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:22,019
age so you know we're learning more

186
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,280
about the endocannabinoid system and I

187
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,219
think that

188
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,079
um some of the key studies that

189
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,580
that have tried to understand

190
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,519
differences in the endocannabinoid

191
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,740
system between males and females are

192
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,179
a lot of them are based off of you know

193
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,219
the pharmacological studies so

194
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,038
understanding

195
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:44,399
um differences between males and females

196
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,958
in their response to THC and what are

197
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,940
some of the

198
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,039
um

199
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,100
hormonal modulation of those differences

200
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,019
of THC and so that kind of gets at

201
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,339
sex differences in the endocannabinoid

202
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,580
system

203
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,899
great okay so let's let's talk about the

204
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,339
effects of cannabis and how they may

205
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,799
differ so what are some of the key

206
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,560
differences that have been observed When

207
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,099
comparing how cannabis affects males and

208
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,099
females

209
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,338
the key difference is thus far that we

210
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,459
know of

211
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,740
um again I always like to to turn back

212
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,719
to the animal literature and a lot of

213
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,000
that is is rooted in that in that one

214
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,759
paper that you first talked about

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,799
we've learned a lot from the animal

216
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,059
literature with respect to how males and

217
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,219
females might differ and what we're

218
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:35,278
doing now in the human lab those people

219
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,019
who study humans Volunteers in the

220
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,958
laboratory is we're really trying to

221
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:43,080
translate what's been observed in the

222
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,759
animal studies and to see if those

223
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,240
effects are

224
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:51,319
are preserved or translated to to humans

225
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,220
so some of the key things that

226
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,600
pre-clinical researchers or animal

227
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:00,480
researchers have found is that

228
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,000
across the board female animals seem to

229
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,800
be more sensitive

230
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,720
to thc's effects now you know THC has a

231
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,599
lot of different effects and what's

232
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,600
interesting here is that females seem to

233
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,940
be sensitive to a lot of those different

234
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,278
effects so it's not just one end point

235
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,260
it seems to be a number of different

236
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,740
endpoints for example

237
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:27,720
females appear to be more sensitive to

238
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,700
the pain relieving effects of THC

239
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,399
compared to males and here again we're

240
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,160
just we're talking about animals here

241
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:39,659
female animals are also more sensitive

242
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:43,740
to what we call abuse related effects of

243
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:45,899
THC and THC like drugs compared to males

244
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,959
now it's interesting

245
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,620
um in those animal studies is that

246
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:56,338
although there is clearly a sensitivity

247
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,320
to THC into two THC like substances in

248
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,380
female animals compared to compared to

249
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,420
males what's interesting is that when

250
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:07,320
you when you give these groups of

251
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:10,139
animals THC or THC like substances

252
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,839
um these drugs repeatedly for many

253
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:15,179
different days let's say for two weeks

254
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,000
or three weeks what you see is that both

255
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:21,359
groups do develop tolerance right so the

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,458
effects of the THC will be lower such

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,980
that you'll you'll need higher doses to

258
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,479
achieve the same effect that you get

259
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,680
with that first day of Drug

260
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,200
Administration

261
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:35,278
but what's interesting is that among the

262
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,100
female animals the tolerance is much

263
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:41,220
more Stark so the female seem to develop

264
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,159
tolerance at a much faster rate or at a

265
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,278
higher magnitude than the males

266
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,259
um and we see something very similar

267
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,899
um in in our human studies

268
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:53,220
we can go into that a little bit then if

269
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,458
you like

270
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,220
um where what we've found this is

271
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:01,559
similar to the animal studies where you

272
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,720
know females

273
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:10,259
um women will actually show a blunted

274
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,120
pain response when exposed to THC I'm

275
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,720
sorry a blunted analgesic response when

276
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,759
exposed to THC compared to men but

277
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,639
what's interesting is that we see this

278
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,399
specifically in in people that are using

279
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,319
cannabis every day or almost every day

280
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,019
so we're we're dealing with a population

281
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,019
there that is that is using cannabis on

282
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:34,379
a daily basis and presumably

283
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,060
probably more tolerant to thc's effects

284
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:40,019
and let's say somebody who's using

285
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:42,419
weekly or maybe you know bi-weekly

286
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,879
um what's interesting also is that in in

287
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:47,819
that group of people we're not looking

288
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:51,059
at people who who have a chronic pain

289
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,120
condition where we're looking to see in

290
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:56,338
a normal healthy population if we look

291
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,519
at a pain response

292
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,320
um due to a painful stimulus will THC

293
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,120
decrease that pain response and so we

294
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,700
see that pretty clearly in males but not

295
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,159
but not in females and so we're building

296
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,620
on that now to understand

297
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,240
um how much this tolerance play a role

298
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,339
in that effect so do we see the same

299
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,620
effect in people that don't use cannabis

300
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,959
every day or several times a day and

301
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,919
also

302
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:24,899
to what degree do do the hormones do

303
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,539
female reproductive hormones play a role

304
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,578
in in differences here between the males

305
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,860
and the females

306
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:35,278
excellent so now you mentioned animal

307
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,740
studies versus human studies so

308
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,379
are you seeing a lot of the results in

309
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,940
the animal studies you know confirmed by

310
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,740
human studies or is there a departure

311
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,320
there

312
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,560
so thus far based off of the the studies

313
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,379
in in our laboratory as well as other

314
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,539
people's studies it does seem like

315
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,278
there's an inter interesting kind of

316
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,439
parody here between uh the animal

317
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,139
studies and the human studies so it

318
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,860
doesn't always work out such that

319
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,259
um

320
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,000
what's observed in the animal world is

321
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:08,639
necessarily translated into humans right

322
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,200
I mean humans a mouse is not a rat is

323
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,940
not a non-human primate it's not a it's

324
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,339
not a human right so we have there's

325
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,779
there's a there's a long chain of

326
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,639
evolution here

327
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:19,919
um and so it isn't always the case that

328
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,560
what we see in a rodent model is going

329
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,778
to be translated to to humans but there

330
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,879
are some really nice

331
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:30,000
um data suggesting that there is some

332
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:33,360
nice translation between between animals

333
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,360
and humans here and one of these areas

334
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,180
um is with respect to how males and

335
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,199
females metabolize THC differently and

336
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:45,958
how pharmacokinetics and the way that

337
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,240
the way that THC is metabolized of the

338
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,479
pharmacokinetics of THC

339
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,240
we think probably has a

340
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,339
um direct effect on

341
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,379
its impact on physiology and behavior

342
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,380
right so if somebody metabolizes THC

343
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:04,078
very quickly into metabolites that are

344
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,698
inactive then that

345
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,799
plays a role in what we're going to see

346
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,299
on the behavioral endpoint the

347
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,838
physiological endpoint

348
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:15,899
and so what's nice is that other labs so

349
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:19,620
lab and Johns Hopkins with Ryan vandry

350
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:22,259
and spindle and and scholar and others

351
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,339
they you know they've found in humans

352
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:27,778
that um females

353
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:30,420
metabolize THC in a different way than

354
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:32,639
males in a very similar way that's been

355
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:36,419
and show that's been shown in animal

356
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,778
studies as well where females

357
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:42,059
um will show higher levels of an active

358
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:44,820
THC metabolite after a THC

359
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:49,259
Administration compared to males so that

360
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:51,540
active metabolite is 11-hydroxy THC and

361
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:53,338
the group at Johns Hopkins also sees

362
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:56,278
this effect where females will show

363
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:58,380
greater 11-hydroxy THC levels after

364
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,240
being exposed to THC compared to males

365
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:02,879
so there there have been some nice

366
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,459
parallel parallels there as well

367
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,458
excellent so males and females actually

368
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,599
metabolize THC differently I have that

369
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:12,359
right

370
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,820
yeah so based off of animal studies and

371
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,639
and based off of human studies

372
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,800
um as far as as we know right now you

373
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,220
know it does it does seem like they are

374
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:25,019
metabolizing the THC differently now why

375
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,879
are they metabolizing the THC

376
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:29,039
differently that's like uh you know

377
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,500
that's an important question it could

378
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,778
have to do with the

379
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,360
um the metabolic enzymes they might be

380
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:38,278
different in both in both

381
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,680
um the animals and the humans with

382
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,620
respect to males and females

383
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:47,399
um it might have to do with other other

384
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:50,940
aspects that impact metabolism

385
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,820
um in our lab we we're looking at uh

386
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,860
differences in how THC is metabolize or

387
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,660
the pharmacokinetics of THC between

388
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,519
males and females

389
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,679
to try and understand

390
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,539
why there might be a behavioral

391
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,818
difference so why it is that males and

392
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:10,078
females might respond differently to THC

393
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:13,199
on the pain relieving aspect of things

394
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,899
as well as other aspects like mood

395
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,900
related effects abuse related effects

396
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,120
and we're also looking to see if maybe

397
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,819
some of these differences are due to

398
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,019
differences in

399
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:27,599
endocannabinoid levels and so we're

400
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:29,220
drawing blood from women to see if the

401
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,959
differences that we see between males

402
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,419
and females if they're somewhat

403
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,779
associated with differences in Baseline

404
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:40,740
endocannabino levels or is it you know

405
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:43,319
are differences really rooted in levels

406
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,079
of female reproductive hormones which is

407
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:49,678
an interesting variable also because in

408
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,899
animal studies there's data to suggest

409
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,460
that

410
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,620
estradiol

411
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:59,700
plays a significant role in the

412
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:02,639
sensitivity to THC in female animals so

413
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,580
it does seem like females food

414
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,340
productive hormones do play a role in

415
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:11,819
sensitivity to THC

416
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:15,000
great and now how wide is the difference

417
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:16,740
yeah I mean you say that you know

418
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,038
females are more sensitive or they

419
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,859
metabolize THC differently is it vastly

420
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:26,099
different is it slight

421
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:28,678
right so in science we say significantly

422
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:30,719
different right right

423
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,880
um but no so here's here's a sense of

424
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,960
things um Ben

425
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,700
um

426
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,558
this is one difference and again we're

427
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,179
probing this right now to figure out

428
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:40,259
what variables are underlying this

429
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,019
effect and it's something that I

430
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,000
mentioned before where in our volunteers

431
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,679
who are using cannabis daily and again

432
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,419
they're not medical cannabis users

433
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,580
they're using for non-medical reasons

434
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,020
but when they come to our lab and we

435
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:54,659
give them cannabis

436
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,038
with THC in it specifically I'm not

437
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,620
talking about other cannabinoids at this

438
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:01,379
point when we give them a cannabis with

439
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:03,538
THC and we look at the pain response

440
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,299
between males and females essentially we

441
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:08,460
see a significant

442
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:10,259
analgesic effect in the males uh such

443
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,298
that you know it's significantly

444
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:14,579
different from Placebo if you looked at

445
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:16,200
the data you'd say okay they the males

446
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:18,119
in this group the male Volunteers in

447
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,640
this group are getting some pain relief

448
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,739
here when you look at the females the

449
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,620
the female volunteers after a smoking

450
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,720
cannabis with THC in it essentially they

451
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,939
look like they just received Placebo so

452
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,700
Placebo cannabis with no THC so there's

453
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,298
really no difference they're not getting

454
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,279
um any type of that pain relieving

455
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:40,819
effect of THC that the males are getting

456
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,500
and so in that case it is quite a stark

457
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:46,139
contrast between the two

458
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,298
we have and keep in mind again these are

459
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,280
people who are using cannabis every day

460
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,379
and so we think that there's probably a

461
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,460
development of of Tolerance the

462
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,020
development of Tolerance is probably

463
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,940
different between these two groups and

464
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:59,339
males and the females

465
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,960
um as shown in in animal models we're in

466
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:03,298
animals when you expose them to THC

467
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,700
every day the females will show this

468
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:08,279
robust tolerance to the pain relieving

469
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,460
effects of THC that the males show but

470
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:13,079
not as as significant of an effect there

471
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,319
are other aspects where we don't

472
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,079
necessarily see such a stark contrast

473
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:22,200
um so for example

474
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:24,480
among some of our female volunteers when

475
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,038
we ask them how how them how much they

476
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,079
like the Cannabis you know what kind of

477
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:31,558
good effect they have

478
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:34,199
um they'll they'll rate that cannabis as

479
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,599
having a good effect to a higher level

480
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,640
than the males the male volunteers and

481
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:41,759
that's also it's similar to what's shown

482
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,919
in the animal models but it's not as as

483
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,538
Stark of a difference as you know what

484
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,679
we see on the pain relieving end of

485
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,538
things

486
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,320
um so I think that depending on the end

487
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,079
point

488
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:55,079
depending on the person

489
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,058
um depending on how much cannabis

490
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,639
they've been using and for what reason

491
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:01,558
they've been using it

492
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,980
will probably probably see differences

493
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:08,339
in the magnitude of

494
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,839
how much sex plays a role in cannabis

495
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:11,159
effects

496
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,019
um and

497
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,700
you know it's it's going to take time to

498
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,740
work out what are some of the variables

499
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,960
in play here

500
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,599
um but it will be really important

501
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,360
information I think

502
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:27,659
as more women are turning to cannabis

503
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:29,959
for pain in this case right for for pain

504
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:34,140
relief

505
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,179
understanding you know what

506
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,600
what

507
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:42,000
can people expect with respect to the

508
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,678
dose that might be helpful the mode of

509
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,240
administration so here we're just

510
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,519
talking about

511
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,859
um inhaled cannabis right what happens

512
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,259
when they use it orally right and so

513
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:53,759
that's a that's a very different

514
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:56,519
metabolic process that occurs when

515
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,519
people when people are using THC orally

516
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:03,918
And So It ultimately the hope is that

517
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:07,139
this information will be helpful in

518
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,259
informing people what they might expect

519
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,820
when they use THC and other cannabinoids

520
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,919
for pain relief

521
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:16,918
both for the pay relief side but also

522
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,380
you know potentially for some negative

523
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,360
aspects as well so you know it's been

524
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,100
shown the Groupon does Hopkins has has

525
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,139
shown that females might be more

526
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:30,359
sensitive to the anxiety provoking

527
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:33,299
aspects of THC right and so that's

528
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,279
something important to relate to uh to

529
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:37,019
the community as well is that you know

530
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,139
females might be more sensitive to that

531
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:42,839
aspect of of cannabis as well

532
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,100
yeah no I think that is important and

533
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,959
now I wanna

534
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,759
talk about you know the difference

535
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,380
between animals and humans again because

536
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,140
correct me if I'm wrong but when you're

537
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,120
measuring the effects of cannabis in

538
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,580
humans a lot of it's self-reported

539
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,399
correct where you know the the patient

540
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,500
is telling the researcher you know yeah

541
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,200
it reduced my pain or yeah it gave me

542
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,500
anxiety talk a bit about the difference

543
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,200
between males and females and how they

544
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,179
re they self-report because when I spoke

545
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,779
to Daddy Mary on the podcast a while

546
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:17,280
back he he observed that there was a

547
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:20,279
difference that you know the females

548
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,200
might be reporting more information or

549
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:23,700
have more thoughtful responses and then

550
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,679
the males need a little bit more

551
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,400
prodding to get to get the information

552
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,919
out of them yes Ben and I think that you

553
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,240
know you're hitting the hammer on the

554
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,440
nail of how important it is to do

555
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,120
placebo-controlled studies especially

556
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,720
when you're relying on something like

557
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,639
self-report right and so when you do a

558
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,620
placebo-controlled study what you can do

559
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,000
is you're essentially looking if it's a

560
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:51,000
what's called a within subject design

561
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,380
where the person is exposed to all the

562
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
different drug conditions so in the

563
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,780
placebo-controlled study they're exposed

564
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,220
to the placebo drug and they're also

565
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:01,139
exposed to the active drug so in this

566
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,600
case let's say it would be cannabis

567
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,759
without THC and nothing else or Placebo

568
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,619
cannabis and then our cannabis with THC

569
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,200
and then what you would do is you can

570
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:12,119
subtract out the placebo response from

571
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,220
the active response and so there you're

572
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:17,639
you're actually looking at

573
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:21,120
people as their own controls right and

574
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,679
so yes females they might show

575
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,298
differences with respect to their

576
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,720
self-reported

577
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:28,339
pain or their or their self-reported

578
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,798
um

579
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:34,918
anxiety uh or how good of a drug effect

580
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:36,960
they have but presumably they would have

581
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,679
a similar

582
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,058
um

583
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,460
a similar self-reported

584
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:46,558
um behave self-reporting Behavior under

585
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,960
the placebo situation as well or under

586
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,460
the Lo the very low cannabis dose right

587
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,380
whatever whatever you're doing in our in

588
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,419
our lab we generally look at a couple of

589
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,299
different Doses and so you're able to

590
00:24:54,419 --> 00:25:00,720
kind of subtract out that type of effect

591
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:02,879
but you're right so animals are are you

592
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,620
know they're they're good test subjects

593
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,760
right because

594
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,219
um you don't have to worry about if

595
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,419
they're blind to the dose uh you know

596
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,720
you're you're really looking at

597
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:16,740
objective measures of of behavior there

598
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,839
that you can that you can you know feel

599
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,339
good about the data and say that you

600
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,599
know these are objective you don't you

601
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:23,579
have to worry about the animal telling

602
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,980
you things but at the same time

603
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,899
at the end of the day you know when

604
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,620
you're talking about patients and you're

605
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,640
talking about thinking about how certain

606
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:34,139
medicines might be helpful or you're

607
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,740
thinking about

608
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,038
um

609
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,319
uh symptoms and disease states it is so

610
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,839
important that the patient can

611
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,939
communicate to The Physician or to the

612
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,699
scientist to the researcher about what

613
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,580
it is they're feeling right so you know

614
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,298
when somebody talks about pain and and

615
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:56,339
the objective measure of pain what to

616
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:58,619
what level does this chronic pain

617
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:59,639
patient have an objective measure of

618
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,819
pain

619
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,620
versus what they're telling you how and

620
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:06,298
how much pain are they how much pain are

621
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:08,819
they feeling right now

622
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:12,658
when you're giving them a medicine

623
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:14,460
you know to help reduce their pain

624
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:16,140
hopefully you know you're really trying

625
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,360
to get at that you know what they're

626
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,919
what they're telling you they feel you

627
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,839
know so having an objective measure of

628
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,480
pain is important but really you know

629
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,058
they're self-reported pain is really

630
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,759
critical and also understanding

631
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:31,619
how that self-reported pain might be

632
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,240
impacting their quality of life for

633
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,979
their daily functioning and so those are

634
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,919
other proxies that I think are really

635
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,259
important to address when doing you know

636
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,538
randomized clinical trial of chronic

637
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,099
pain patients and understanding how

638
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:46,440
cannabis and cannabinoids might be

639
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:48,000
helpful so having a a range of endpoints

640
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,620
there not just self-reported pain but

641
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,099
also understanding how is that pain

642
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:54,479
impacting you know the

643
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:56,939
holistically their life

644
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,860
um from that lens

645
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,480
right yeah because at the end of the day

646
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:03,479
we're just trying to help people feel

647
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,460
better right exactly yeah

648
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,860
yeah all right so I wanted to shift a

649
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,340
little bit and maybe talk about how

650
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:12,538
males and females use different cannabis

651
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:15,298
products

652
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:17,460
um is there much information around that

653
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:19,139
so Ben I think that

654
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,860
um

655
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,720
there there are data and you know I'm

656
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:27,479
I'm terrible I forgot

657
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,919
I can't I can't recall

658
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,839
a good study that has looked at how you

659
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,179
know women are using cannabis products

660
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,119
versus men and what the you know are

661
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,340
there differences like I do

662
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,658
inhaled cannabis even though there are

663
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,959
lots of different products available now

664
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:48,539
inhale cannabis is still the most

665
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,798
popular mode of administration at a

666
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:52,798
population level

667
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:55,319
but what we hear is that you know from

668
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:58,379
media sources and you know anecdotally

669
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,939
is that you know females women might be

670
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,580
using

671
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,919
um oral cannabis products

672
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:08,460
um they may be they might gravitate

673
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,980
towards those more than inhaled for X Y

674
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,558
and Z reason but and I can't I don't

675
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,298
have a good paper to you know usually

676
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,859
like I I like to pull out those peer

677
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:19,200
review Publications and say this

678
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,819
researcher and this place demonstrated

679
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,740
that females use this mode of

680
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:26,639
administration where the males

681
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:31,919
um I will say though that you know as

682
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:34,860
the Cannabis Market is evolving we are

683
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,259
starting to see products that are

684
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:40,918
available specifically for medical

685
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:43,158
indications in women right and so some

686
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,440
of these products

687
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,659
are geared the the way that they're

688
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,980
administered are specifically geared to

689
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,840
females

690
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,339
um and so you can imagine some of those

691
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,139
different products that might be geared

692
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:57,418
more towards females that don't really

693
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,059
aren't relevant for males

694
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,919
um and I don't necessarily know you know

695
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:03,658
the rates of use of these types of

696
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,759
products among females I think it'll be

697
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:11,120
interesting to see over the long term

698
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:13,079
you know as there becomes some

699
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,519
generalizability with respect to what's

700
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:16,678
available across States right because

701
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,898
right now states are functioning very

702
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,100
differently and you know there's one

703
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:22,019
product that's available in California

704
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:25,379
but it's not available in New York City

705
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:28,440
I think over time as you know the dust

706
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:31,500
settles and there is

707
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,460
um there is some continuity between the

708
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,278
types of products that are available

709
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,919
across States it will be interesting to

710
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,380
see what types of products females are

711
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,720
using what are they using them for

712
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,120
um compared to males and

713
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,839
how do the motives are the reasons for

714
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,500
use differ between females

715
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,720
um

716
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,740
and you know as an example like there's

717
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,200
certain

718
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,480
um Health indications or you know

719
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,340
medical issues that are more prevalent

720
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,339
among females than males for example

721
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:05,278
fibromyalgia right so

722
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:07,619
um more females have fibromyalgia than

723
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:13,259
males and so what type of products are

724
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:15,658
are those patients uh drawn to we have a

725
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:18,179
um a study look we haven't talked about

726
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:21,539
cannabidiol yet but we have a study here

727
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:24,179
at UCLA that I'm working on with a

728
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:26,759
principal investigator who I

729
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,679
um who's really wonderful her name is

730
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,000
um Vino ranganath and she's a

731
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,399
rheumatologist and we have a study

732
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,599
looking at cannabidiol for rheumatoid

733
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,939
arthritis

734
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,759
and what we're finding is that you know

735
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,380
as expected we have a lot of females in

736
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:43,019
that study just because you know

737
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,480
rheumatoid arthritis occurs at a higher

738
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:48,298
frequency among females and males and so

739
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,640
you know that's an example of over time

740
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:52,500
we're going to see how

741
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,659
different

742
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,119
um males and females might differ with

743
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:59,880
respect to their reasons for cannabis

744
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,379
use as well as the type of cannabinoid

745
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,179
they're using and the mode of

746
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,460
administration

747
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,500
yeah you're right we have been the the

748
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,319
conversation has been centered a lot

749
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,298
around THC so what do we know about the

750
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,220
other cannabinoids are there sex

751
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:16,259
differences there as well

752
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,538
yeah and even in the pre-clinical

753
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:21,179
literature right now then

754
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:23,519
um you know this is an area that is so

755
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,860
new uh

756
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,599
as far as I know you know the one or two

757
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:29,639
studies that I've looked at cannabidiol

758
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,579
and sex dependent effects and animals

759
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,980
they haven't really found

760
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:37,199
Stark differences

761
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,399
um and I know that uh there's been a

762
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,679
study

763
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,658
um comparing males and females with

764
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,100
respect to cannabidiol and hail

765
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:46,260
cannabidiol again this was our

766
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:48,298
colleagues at Johns Hopkins

767
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:51,000
um that show that females might be a

768
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:52,859
little bit more sensitive to how the

769
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,440
drug makes them feel how cannabidile

770
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:57,658
makes them feel compared to males but

771
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,880
you know this is just kind of the tip of

772
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:01,320
the iceberg you know cannabidiol

773
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,000
understanding how males and females

774
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,819
differ in their response to cannabidal

775
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,679
what about some of the other

776
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:09,480
cannabinoids that people are using now

777
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,360
people are being drawn to for example

778
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,880
Canaveral CBG

779
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,639
um CBN so we're seeing in California you

780
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,260
know CBN is becoming more popular people

781
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,460
think that CBM might be helpful for

782
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,898
Sleep

783
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,798
um so are there sex dependent effects

784
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:27,359
with CBN what about terpenes right and

785
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:29,398
so you know we're starting to see an

786
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,459
Emerging Market of cannabis based

787
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,019
products that have specific terpenes in

788
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,880
them and so are there sex dependent

789
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:37,440
effects with terpenes too and the truth

790
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,240
is is that it's hard for me to

791
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,740
hypothesize if there will be a

792
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,960
difference because even in animal

793
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,759
studies right now they're haven't really

794
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,640
been

795
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:50,819
good efforts to understand if there is a

796
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,919
sex dependent effect in part because the

797
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:55,379
studies on those cannabis constituents

798
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,640
are kind of just starting also so you

799
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,620
know I think that pre-clinical

800
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,899
researchers are now just trying to get a

801
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:03,359
hold of what do these terpenes do what

802
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:06,000
do these minor cannabinoids do

803
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,219
and then to try and delve into you know

804
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,398
are there differences between males and

805
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,038
females so there's a lot of work being

806
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:16,979
done in this space and I think there is

807
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:18,419
a lot of attention being paid to

808
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,620
how

809
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:24,120
sex can impact

810
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:25,379
the biological if that's physiological

811
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,339
effects

812
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,120
um

813
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:32,519
effects in the central nervous system so

814
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:34,259
over time I think we'll get a better

815
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,359
picture of

816
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:38,460
you know what's happening as a function

817
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,558
of sex and then also you know we didn't

818
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,058
talk about sex versus gender you know

819
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:46,019
and I think that's also a really

820
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:47,639
important topic that as scientists the

821
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,159
scientific Community as a whole I think

822
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,880
were just kind of waking up to you know

823
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:57,960
understanding does gender how somebody

824
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:00,059
you know defines their gender not sex is

825
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,120
a biological variable but gender you

826
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:04,980
know can that also impact

827
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,079
um how people use cannabis and

828
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,358
cannabinoids and what the outcomes might

829
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:12,480
be and I think over time as well we're

830
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,059
going to see uh some nice data in that

831
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,219
area specifically because I think that

832
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:20,099
the the funding agencies are starting to

833
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:22,319
pay more attention to this as well so

834
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:25,619
you know this idea that you know there

835
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,320
can be sex dependent effects of drugs

836
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:30,000
um you know we're able to really look at

837
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,338
this in part because there is funding

838
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,139
available to to study it because there's

839
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:35,519
clearly an interest and need for it and

840
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,260
there's also funding from federal

841
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,019
federal sources

842
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,179
and now you know the NIH is is becoming

843
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:43,739
very interested in gender as well as sex

844
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,418
so it'll be

845
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,118
you know interesting to see how the

846
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:50,878
stories how the story unfolds over time

847
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,460
yeah for sure and I've been trying to be

848
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,500
precise in my language and and say sex

849
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,139
and male and female but I did want to

850
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,219
you know ask the question too that you

851
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,259
know we've talked a lot about the

852
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:03,118
biological differences and are there

853
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,859
cultural differences that could be

854
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,579
playing a role here and that would sort

855
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:10,559
of factor into gender identity

856
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:12,199
absolutely and I think that

857
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,179
um you know we think about

858
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:16,980
socio-cultural differences I mean

859
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:19,500
you could take you know the United

860
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:23,338
States as an example I mean even with

861
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,440
respect to you know what jurisdiction

862
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:27,000
you happen to live in and if that

863
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,079
jurisdiction

864
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,739
um has

865
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,079
cannabis dispensaries is there

866
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:36,358
um a perception of stigma around

867
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,740
cannabis because that will also you know

868
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:40,078
impact

869
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:41,819
what people are using and how they're

870
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,160
using it how open they are with our

871
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,519
physicians to talk about it or are they

872
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:50,279
in a place where there's dispensaries on

873
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,559
every block right and so that just in

874
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:58,079
and of itself like you know you're where

875
00:35:52,559 --> 00:36:00,059
you are geographically who who you are

876
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,160
um socializing with what is your family

877
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:03,659
like what is

878
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,598
um

879
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:08,539
what's your occupation right um all

880
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,039
these different aspects are going to

881
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:14,099
feed into

882
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,539
you know who is using cannabis for what

883
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,300
reason

884
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:21,838
um and what are some of the Health and

885
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,880
Social outcomes of of their use of

886
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:27,420
cannabis um will it be

887
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,800
helpful or will they feel like their you

888
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,320
know their uses

889
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,660
um stigmatized and

890
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,280
um will it have to be done

891
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:38,519
um you know secretly for whatever reason

892
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,260
or are they are they scared of law

893
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:43,440
enforcement all these different things I

894
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,760
think are going to go into over time you

895
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,639
know

896
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,940
what is the impact of

897
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:53,879
of cannabis use on health outcomes right

898
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,099
yeah a lot of things to consider all

899
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,680
right Ziva Before I Let You Go I want to

900
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:00,960
give you a chance to mention any other

901
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,219
papers or resources uh that you could

902
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,039
share with the audience if they want to

903
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:08,159
read more or um and then for you

904
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,900
personally if there's social media or a

905
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,358
website that you'd like to plug please

906
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,680
let us know Ben thank you so much for

907
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:15,239
the opportunity so one thing I would

908
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,879
just like to plug we talked a little bit

909
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:20,779
about this in the very beginning was

910
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,480
um you know the importance of looking at

911
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:28,079
age as well as sex so so we know that

912
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,519
there has been a really

913
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,820
uh

914
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,679
sharp increase in cannabis use among the

915
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,260
older population

916
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,838
um and we know very little about the

917
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,579
impact of you know the pharmacokinetics

918
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,739
and pharmacodynamic effects of of

919
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,240
cannabis in in the older population just

920
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,799
because that's probably been studied

921
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:50,819
very much

922
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,560
and so understanding you know the

923
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,420
effects the potential therapeutic

924
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,619
effects potential risks associated with

925
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,838
cannabis use in that older population

926
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:00,240
but also as a function of age so like I

927
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,699
said before we know from animal studies

928
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,639
that you know reproductive hormones play

929
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:08,460
a role in thc's effects well what

930
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:10,858
happens you know when when we reach an

931
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,199
age where you know

932
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:15,000
circulating hormones change drastically

933
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,159
right specifically in women who are

934
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,420
perimenopausal or postmenopausal and so

935
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:22,858
at UCLA we are we're we have a grant to

936
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,599
actually look at this question that

937
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:28,380
we're really excited to look at not just

938
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:30,900
you know inhaled canop cannabis with THC

939
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,119
but also look at Oral THC Administration

940
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,500
as well so to try and understand you

941
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,579
know differences across mode of

942
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,199
administration

943
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,960
um so we're really excited for that and

944
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,358
you know just a plug for our Center at

945
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,400
UCLA so the University of California Los

946
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:47,279
Angeles we have a center for cannabis

947
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,160
and cannabinoids in that Center we have

948
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,920
our our lab that does control Drug

949
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,299
Administration studies but we also study

950
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,280
cannabis from a public health

951
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,680
perspective public policy perspective

952
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,780
it's a really wonderful Center

953
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:04,078
um so so you know feel free to look us

954
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,940
up UCLA cannabis and then you know we

955
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,560
have a Twitter handle as well although

956
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,900
we're not that good about about keeping

957
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:12,719
up with it but it's UCLA cannabis so

958
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,000
thank you so much ben for having me this

959
