all right so this episode we brought

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,079
back Dr zamir punja to talk about total

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,140
yeast and mold

32
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,699
zamir is a professor of plant

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,680
biotechnology at Simon Frazier

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,439
University in Canada

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,360
his research interests include the

36
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,179
etiology and management of plant

37
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,200
diseases on vegetable and Horticultural

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,820
crops

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,879
and the application of plant

40
00:01:53,819 --> 00:02:00,059
biotechnology for disease management

41
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,578
since 2018 his work has shifted on

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,560
Research in cannabis and his group has

43
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,199
described a range of previously

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,199
unreported pathogens affecting the crop

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,000
and has evaluated various methods for

46
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,459
disease management

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,459
his team just published the results of a

48
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,739
three-year study that identified several

49
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,479
factors that have a direct effect on

50
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,180
yeast and mold levels

51
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,280
they include factors related to Growing

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,840
drying and trimming cannabis

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,479
specifically

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,239
this is important because when Growers

55
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,280
fail for microbial testing yeast in mold

56
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,080
is often the reason

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,878
so if you are a grower that has

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,580
struggled with total yeast and mold

59
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,919
perhaps these findings in the paper and

60
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,819
on this podcast can help you get back on

61
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,919
track

62
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,439
I've put a link to the paper in the show

63
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,958
description and if you're watching on

64
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,939
YouTube I've added several figures and

65
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,019
images from the paper throughout the

66
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,139
conversation

67
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,180
we cover the different species of yeast

68
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,039
and mold that are commonly found on

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,719
cannabis and which are potentially

70
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,299
harmful to humans

71
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,818
the value of total yeast in mold testing

72
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,200
as an indicator of product safety and

73
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:12,780
quality

74
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,459
what is a reasonable threshold for total

75
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,098
yeast and mold

76
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,598
how cannabis genotype affects totally

77
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:22,560
stumbled levels

78
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:25,079
why Leaf litter drives up tym levels why

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,280
hang drying is a better method than wet

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,080
trimming

81
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,000
the drawbacks of a radiation and more

82
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,980
before we get to my conversation with

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,580
Samir I want to thank this episode

100
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,539
good morning zamir thanks again for

101
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,360
joining us on the podcast

102
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,919
hi Ben good to see you again yeah I know

103
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,419
we had to get you back in we had to get

104
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,519
you back in quick too because I know

105
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,519
that you and your team you recently

106
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,439
published um a great paper

107
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,478
um about total yeast and mold in

108
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,579
cannabis and uh that's one of our

109
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,860
favorite topics here on the podcast and

110
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:01,379
at medicinal genomics as you know uh

111
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,180
total yeast in mold seems to be one of

112
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,360
those tests that Growers really struggle

113
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,639
with and more often than not if if a

114
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,620
batch is failing for microbial it's

115
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,680
either for total yeast and mold or maybe

116
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,600
more specifically aspergillus which is a

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,019
fungi and would be kind of included in

118
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,060
that category so always good to to

119
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,579
explore that topic and I know that your

120
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,978
paper it includes some factors that

121
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:29,639
you've identified for causing high tym

122
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:32,219
levels so hopefully we can get some good

123
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:35,100
best practices or recommendations for

124
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,139
Growers that they can enact so that uh

125
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,460
they have fewer failures but before we

126
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,918
get into that

127
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,758
I wanted to ask you why you and your

128
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,038
team

129
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,660
um were interested in investigating tym

130
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,060
and cannabis

131
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,680
right so you know t t who I am in

132
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,780
cannabis is certainly

133
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,360
um one of the most common things that

134
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,038
that Growers will encounter

135
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,379
um it's it's everywhere in the sense

136
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,240
that yeast and mode is not specific to

137
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,219
cannabis

138
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,160
um apples blueberries raspberries

139
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,860
strawberries you name it uh peanuts any

140
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,900
product that's grown out either in the

141
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,879
field or even indoors will always

142
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,459
capture a certain proportion of Eastern

143
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,399
mold because these these organisms feed

144
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:19,560
off of plant material so any exudates

145
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,758
any nutrients anything coming out of a

146
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,978
flower or or a potato or a pod will

147
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,220
attract some level of yeast and mold

148
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:31,219
for the most part these yeasts and molds

149
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,840
aren't necessarily harmful to people

150
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,000
when you consume an apple that's got

151
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,519
some yeast in mold the Tendencies for

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,680
the body to break it all down and digest

153
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,659
it all in it and it's basically gone

154
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,220
cannabis of course because of the

155
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,639
various ways it's used whether it's

156
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,460
inhaled or Vaped or extracted from

157
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,740
yeast and mold apparently has raised

158
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:56,758
greater concern in in cannabis than it

159
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,379
has potentially on other food crops and

160
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,439
so of course the Regulatory Agencies

161
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,839
have established the criteria for

162
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:05,579
testing for yeast in mold and

163
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,839
established levels that will cause a

164
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:08,758
product to fail

165
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,379
so the reason it's hard to manage and

166
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,900
the reason we were interested in it is

167
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:14,699
because you know it is everywhere and we

168
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,399
wanted to find out are there certain

169
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,460
things that Growers may be doing or not

170
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,739
doing that may increase or decrease the

171
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:23,579
levels of yeast and mold in their

172
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,800
product

173
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:27,120
so we didn't actually manipulate the

174
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,038
yeast and moles that were naturally

175
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,500
occurring but what we did was we tried

176
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,439
to understand if you if you planted a

177
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,079
certain genotype if you had a certain

178
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,180
type of air circulation if you were

179
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,180
leaving a lot of leaf litter on the on

180
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,340
the floor would those things increase or

181
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,038
decrease the levels of yeast and mold

182
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,538
and um up until now nobody's actually

183
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,879
looked at that you know we've looked at

184
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,860
yeast and mold after a product is

185
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,379
harvested so for example if you

186
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,439
irradiated what happens if you heat it

187
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,000
up to a certain temperature what happens

188
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,160
if you analyze it in the lab using

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,399
different methods what happens we wanted

190
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,560
to find out from a grower perspective

191
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:11,038
what could they be doing to try to

192
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,620
reduce those those levels in flour

193
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,379
yeah excellent and

194
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,598
so what did you find I mean more

195
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,879
specifically um you know I know that

196
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,139
you've identified like certain types of

197
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,120
species

198
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,379
um that you found in more abundance than

199
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,939
others I don't know if that might be a

200
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,060
good thing to explore

201
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,038
right so um so we we sort of analyzed

202
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,379
all the types of Eastern mold you know

203
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,718
we found a total and and we actually

204
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,458
went a step further and identified all

205
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,479
the different species using molecular

206
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:45,059
methods and um penicillium penicillium

207
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,759
was the one that seemed to be the most

208
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,799
prevalent on on cannabis flower now

209
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:53,039
again penicillium is everywhere you you

210
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,740
can find it indoors if you've got a home

211
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,639
that has you know slightly damp

212
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,159
conditions you'll find it in your

213
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,259
basement you'll find it in your rug

214
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,259
you'll find it sometimes in your clothes

215
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,838
I mean it's there you know and it it

216
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,179
obviously most of us can can deal with

217
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,459
it you know in our bodies because we're

218
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,639
used to it we may be inhaling it it's

219
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,838
not so much of an issue but in cannabis

220
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,419
um and we don't know enough about

221
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,060
penicillin actually it may or may not be

222
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:23,159
of concern so that was the first the

223
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,958
most prevalent one we've known and then

224
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,000
we found a bunch of others that normally

225
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,759
occur in the air things like Alton area

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,120
and another fungus called cladysporium

227
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,379
which which is quite common in the air

228
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,360
aspergillus wasn't that high you know

229
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:37,080
the overall levels of aspergillus we

230
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,300
found

231
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,820
wasn't high now this is under Greenhouse

232
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,259
cultivation right so you know we don't

233
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,120
have a lot of plant material laying

234
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,819
around it we're not next to a wooded

235
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,679
area or a forest where you may have a

236
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,300
lot of aspergillus flying in you know

237
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,699
blowing in through the air

238
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,740
so that wasn't a big concern in terms of

239
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,440
the sampling we did in the greenhouse we

240
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,440
found primarily the the penicillions and

241
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,320
then some Alton area and um titusporium

242
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,120
species present

243
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
yeah I know I'm glad you mentioned

244
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,299
aspergillus

245
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,700
um and were you looking specifically at

246
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:14,458
the species level too like where is it

247
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,860
um sort of the pathogenic strains of of

248
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:19,500
aspergillus your flavus fumigatus Niger

249
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,419
terrius yeah so we the primers we use

250
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,159
should have been able to to separate

251
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,299
those out because then we also looked at

252
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,299
sequences

253
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:29,419
we didn't find a lot of fumigatas we

254
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:32,458
didn't find a lot of the the pathogenic

255
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:36,000
strains the one we found was it was

256
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:37,819
called aspergillus or gracious or

257
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,659
gracious and it's it's actually a yellow

258
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,640
aspergillus you know sometimes you can

259
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:44,639
on a petri dish when you grow these

260
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,019
moles like we do for for a long time one

261
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,078
you know one of them is black another

262
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:51,600
one's green another one's gray ours is

263
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,578
yellow and and it's a species that is

264
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,639
not on the current list

265
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:58,379
of regulated aspergillus species now

266
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,059
that's not to say it's not important

267
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,759
it's just for some reason it's never

268
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,278
made it onto that list and maybe it's

269
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:08,278
not pathogenic right it's it hasn't been

270
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,799
uh flagged as being a pathogenic species

271
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,240
but because it's aspergillus they're

272
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,338
pretty much everywhere they're on

273
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,060
decaying plant material they're in the

274
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,860
air

275
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:18,479
it just so happens that in the

276
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,899
greenhouse we picked up more of this

277
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,519
yellow aspergillus species they want the

278
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,519
second one we found was aspergillus

279
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,200
Niger which is a black aspergillus and

280
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,220
again that's not one of the the really

281
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,320
uh species of concern the ones like the

282
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,259
fumigators and the other ones we didn't

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,720
see a lot of in in the greenhouses that

284
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:41,578
we were working with yeah no Niger

285
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,259
actually is on the list for for many

286
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:45,838
states as one of the the big four

287
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:47,519
pathogenics okay so we did we found a

288
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,620
few of those yeah interesting

289
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,419
interesting yeah

290
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,220
um any of the others that you've

291
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,519
mentioned um are they known to be

292
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,740
pathogenic or even benign to people like

293
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,720
what's what are we looking at there so

294
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,759
you know the the biggest concern I would

295
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,060
say with a lot of these Eastern moles is

296
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,799
is the the toxins and when I say toxin I

297
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,899
don't mean something really scary just

298
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,120
they produce these chemical byproducts

299
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,360
as they grow if you if you're growing up

300
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,399
in in the lab as these cultures grow as

301
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,500
they get a little bit older they produce

302
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,019
these chemical structures that are

303
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,659
referred to as mycotoxins both

304
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,120
penicillium and aspergillus will produce

305
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:30,419
some of these mycotoxins which again

306
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,459
it's on the radar for testing uh

307
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:35,458
OTA for example okra toxin is a

308
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:38,359
microtoxin produced by both aspergillus

309
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:41,458
and penicillin species and it can cause

310
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,959
some issues if it's ingested in a very

311
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,299
high concentration

312
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,159
so for example you know penicillium you

313
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,740
see that on moldy cheese

314
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:52,379
cheese that turns blue has penicillium

315
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,879
on it if you ate a lot of that you'd

316
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:55,860
probably end up with some issues in your

317
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,399
tummy because you know there's secondary

318
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:02,339
metabolites or or toxins produced we

319
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,278
don't know how much or if any toxins are

320
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,440
produced by the penicillium species in

321
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,320
in cannabis that's something that

322
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,260
perhaps will end up on the radar uh

323
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,959
eventually how much of these toxins are

324
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,759
produced fusarium on the other hand

325
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:21,539
which is known to infect wheat and

326
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:23,519
barley and other agricultural crops does

327
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,319
produce a lot of very dangerous

328
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,600
mycotoxins

329
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,639
one of them is called vomitoxin which

330
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,100
when it's ingested when The Barley or

331
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,919
wheat is ingested by by animals like

332
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,420
like cows or cattle they'll vomit like

333
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,778
they'll throw up because there's so much

334
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:42,838
of it in the green we probably as humans

335
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:45,600
wouldn't be exposed to as much but there

336
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:49,500
are cases where poisoning has occurred

337
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,959
by fusarium mycotoxins but again we know

338
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,179
nothing about what they may be doing or

339
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,518
if they're even present in in cannabis

340
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,799
the whole Focus has been primarily on

341
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,078
aspergillus so Better or For Worse I

342
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,719
mean that's what the Regulatory Agencies

343
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:06,659
decided was a priority

344
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,278
yeah I mean and I know that we've uh

345
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,838
We've written about it before it's been

346
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,778
I mean it's one of the tests that we

347
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,180
that we sell to of course

348
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:18,000
um but it is one of the few if not the

349
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:20,338
only you know contaminants on cannabis

350
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,659
that has been shown to uh be actually

351
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,339
fatal

352
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:24,419
um so maybe for a good reason that that

353
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,519
we're there we're testing for

354
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,019
aspergillus yeah that's the one that's

355
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,078
definitely the most well known you know

356
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:33,360
it causes the aspergillosis in in lungs

357
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,338
of humans Farmers it's sometimes

358
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,320
referred as Farmers lung disease because

359
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:40,260
when Farmers work with a lot of hay with

360
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,600
a lot of barley wheat over years they

361
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:45,360
develop a sensitivity to the aspergillus

362
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,480
spores uh and certainly people that are

363
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,480
are immunocompromised or have you know

364
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,839
health conditions uh sometimes diabetes

365
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,060
or even have had organ transplants they

366
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,519
will be more susceptible to problems

367
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:01,859
with aspergillus but for the most part

368
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,198
you know healthy individuals and I would

369
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,839
consider myself healthy and you look

370
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:09,319
pretty healthy to me I doubt either one

371
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,420
of us would suffer from aspergillosis

372
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,660
unless we were smoking you know 12 14

373
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:18,659
joints a day that that had aspergillus

374
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,698
in it on a regular basis we probably

375
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,620
wouldn't suffer from this unless you

376
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:26,099
know we had some underlying conditions

377
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,919
but as you said it can cause problems in

378
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,440
humans and so if there's any doubt any

379
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,939
concern in its flight and so aspergillus

380
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,680
is like

381
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,600
right and now when you were talking

382
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,739
about you know different species and

383
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,360
everything

384
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,919
two that kind of stood out to me that

385
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,959
maybe you didn't mention or maybe you

386
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,000
didn't even find powdery mildew and

387
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,458
botrytus

388
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,980
um yeah did you find that so poverty

389
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,599
mildew uh is there and uh you know

390
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,699
you've seen it on buds I've seen it on

391
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,040
buds it has you know white white sort of

392
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:58,198
a moldy appearance because we were

393
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,000
growing these unconscious media plates

394
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:03,479
in the lab that one doesn't actually

395
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,940
grow on on the plate and so

396
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,000
um it is actually fortunate or

397
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,920
unfortunate not on the radar for total

398
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,320
yeast and mold testing because you can't

399
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,838
you can't test it you can't grow it

400
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,000
so you may see a mole a bud that's

401
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,680
almost white covered in powdery mildew

402
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,659
it may pass

403
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,638
um because it it you know it doesn't it

404
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,838
doesn't grow well tradus was an

405
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,120
interesting one

406
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,579
um we can't we don't see a lot of it

407
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,620
growing on yeast and more plates

408
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:34,679
we know it's there I mean you can see

409
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,659
the treaders mold but uh for some reason

410
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,439
it's it's overgrown by some of these

411
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:40,679
other

412
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,259
um other fungi which in some ways sort

413
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,179
of leads to me to question some of these

414
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:48,300
decent model testing accesses that are

415
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:50,458
done uh from a cultural perspective how

416
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,019
do you know when you do a yeast and mold

417
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,659
test that you're you're culturing

418
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,578
everything that's important for from a

419
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:58,919
disease perspective you may be missing

420
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:01,319
or you meaning the person doing the test

421
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,659
may be missing certain species of fungi

422
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,640
and I think botritis is one that's being

423
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:07,439
missed for some reason it doesn't seem

424
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,540
to want to grow as much

425
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,439
now this botritis cause problems in

426
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:12,418
humans

427
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,000
um we don't know for sure it does

428
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,799
produce some of these metabolites these

429
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,619
mycotoxins that I referred to earlier

430
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:22,439
but again it's not on the radar for for

431
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:26,519
uh for testing from a regulatory

432
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,860
perspective so it it skips it's passed

433
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,418
unless it's super moldy as you know I

434
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,819
mean if it's that bad you don't want to

435
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:35,580
sell that product anywhere

436
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:37,439
sort of the The Moldy strawberry analogy

437
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:39,298
that we always talk about you know even

438
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,620
if you're if you're in the grocery store

439
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:42,720
and you see strawberries that are

440
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,519
covered in mold you're not going to say

441
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,779
it well I guess at past testing so I'm

442
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,819
going to buy it you're just you're going

443
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,798
to go on to a different package and it's

444
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:52,918
interesting that the biggest mold on

445
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,298
strawberry is bertritus interesting yeah

446
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,220
that's the one that tends to cause

447
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:57,900
stories to go bad if you haven't eaten

448
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,019
them in a couple of days

449
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,460
um is detritis so we've been we've

450
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,440
probably been swelling but trying to

451
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,179
spores for for a very long period of

452
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,980
time

453
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:09,720
wow and that I mean and maybe that's a

454
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,860
good thing to bring up too in terms of

455
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,779
like a total yeast and mold test is it

456
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,579
is it really kind of to protect the

457
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:19,379
consumer from potentially getting sick

458
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:22,139
or is it more of just like a check on

459
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,900
just good sanitation or hygienic

460
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,299
processes that are going on in the grow

461
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,400
yeah so I think it's both

462
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:31,139
um the reason it's it's flagged from a

463
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,240
regulatory or health perspective is

464
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:37,500
because of the fact that there are these

465
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,900
reports from the 70s and 80s of uh

466
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,240
aspergillosis occurring or aspergillus

467
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,519
infections sometimes in patients that

468
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,339
have us have smoked cannabis so there's

469
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,379
been a correlation there now how often

470
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:51,720
is it I don't know is it one in a

471
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,460
hundred thousand is it one in ten

472
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,860
thousand we don't have those numbers to

473
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,319
say that out of all the population of

474
00:18:55,859 --> 00:19:00,418
cannabis uh consumers a certain

475
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,879
proportion will get aspergillus

476
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:06,780
infections but I guess if one person

477
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,419
gets it that's enough to to raise a flag

478
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,279
a radar the other yeasts and moles that

479
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,440
are in there that you are you and I are

480
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,859
consuming every day in our diet whether

481
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,440
it's uh strawberry or or blueberry or

482
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,599
some other fresh fruit our bodies deal

483
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,860
with it and break it down and it's it's

484
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,980
not an issue

485
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:28,079
in cannabis we really don't know when we

486
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,599
do these yeast and mole tests and

487
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,178
somebody comes to me and says I got 20

488
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,980
000 or I got 40 000.

489
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,600
I don't know what that means from a

490
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,339
health perspective and I don't think the

491
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,659
health practitioners know what that

492
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:42,538
means either

493
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,100
certainly the more it is you know the

494
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:46,619
more the chances of getting a problem

495
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:49,740
but if you told me that twenty thousand

496
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,418
is twice as bad as ten thousand I

497
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,359
wouldn't believe you because there is no

498
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:56,759
data to support that now if it's a

499
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,558
hundred thousand I would say boy that's

500
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,798
a lot like you shouldn't have a hundred

501
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,779
thousand cfus in a gram when we put that

502
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,779
on a picture there's that petri dish is

503
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:09,000
is covered you can't see the pikriatives

504
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:11,700
it's just got so much mold on it to me

505
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,859
that's not a great product itself

506
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,319
but if you told me it's forty thousand

507
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:18,959
versus ten I have no idea what that

508
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:22,019
means now in Canada we've set the limit

509
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,960
at 50 and and so 50 seems to be a doable

510
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:27,839
number it's a reasonable number in that

511
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,400
uh if you're below 50 you're you

512
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,859
probably have a product that's that's

513
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,900
other than the aspergillus species a

514
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:36,119
product that that's doable in a sense

515
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,740
the body can deal with that level of

516
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,959
mold

517
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,519
um if it's less than that so much the

518
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,279
better because it's getting closer and

519
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,200
closer to being almost almost clean

520
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,639
so different states have set up

521
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,160
different numbers I think Massachusetts

522
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,280
is probably up around 100 000 other

523
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,340
others maybe less uh countries like

524
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:59,160
Israel uh where if you're using cannabis

525
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:01,079
for medical purposes it's zero like the

526
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,840
product has to be essentially irradiated

527
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:06,240
to make sure it's totally clean

528
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,399
so we don't have data on what these

529
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,900
numbers actually mean in terms of a

530
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,179
health perspective

531
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,340
yeah no and I think that's interesting

532
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:17,038
that in Canada it's set at 50 because

533
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:20,099
like you mentioned here in the states I

534
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,140
mean it ranges Iowa I believe if you

535
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:25,319
look on the map that we have on our

536
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,799
website Iowa has it set at 10. literally

537
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:30,240
10 cfu which seems almost impossible

538
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,619
um and then you have Florida and I

539
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,839
believe Michigan and maybe Connecticut

540
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,219
too they're up to a hundred thousand and

541
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,199
everywhere in between but it's all

542
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,640
orders of 10.

543
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,819
um so it's funny that Canada is like

544
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,559
well 50. so it's well we've always been

545
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:45,418
known as a country that sort of tries to

546
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,339
balance things out and you know make

547
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:49,440
sure that we're we're approaching things

548
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,899
from a reasonable perspective I have

549
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,860
never seen I have never seen a cannabis

550
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,600
flower uh come in at zero yeah and I've

551
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,599
never I would never have seen a flower

552
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:03,418
come in at 10. so that's unreasonable to

553
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:06,839
me uh to to have something that will uh

554
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:09,360
walking down the park to your car you've

555
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:11,939
already inhaled more than 10 quality

556
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,740
forming units of mold because of the

557
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,779
mold in the trees and in the flowers and

558
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,359
everything else around you so there has

559
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:20,639
to be a reasonable number that says you

560
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,259
know I'm not saying 50 is reasonable but

561
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,940
there has to be a number that says okay

562
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,879
we can deal with that from a grower

563
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,740
perspective you know when when we see 50

564
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,080
000 on on flower

565
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,679
it's usually a product that has been

566
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:36,480
grown under very high humidity or it's

567
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,179
during the peak of Summer where there's

568
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,298
a lot of heat or it's a flower that's

569
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,759
had some damage done to it because 50 is

570
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:47,220
still a very high number uh to to to

571
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,759
meet in other words most things should

572
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,860
pass 50 000. I've seen maybe two to

573
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,460
three percent of product get rejected

574
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:58,259
because it's been over 50 000. so that

575
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,179
that's a good number to say that okay

576
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:03,240
you know what below 50 things are

577
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:06,419
probably going to be okay so 10 or 50 or

578
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,279
100 cfus to me is is very low

579
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,200
I mean it's impossible really because

580
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,399
everything out there has mold on it

581
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,679
right

582
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,480
and really I mean so I kind of go back

583
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,798
to what we were saying before it's not

584
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,900
so much

585
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,359
how much mold although that can be an

586
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,880
indicator but it's what type is on there

587
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,459
too right because I mean yes so say you

588
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,140
you've set the limit at 50 like you're

589
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,340
having Canada

590
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:34,259
um if you had 40 000 cfus of say

591
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:36,839
aspergillus that's much more concerning

592
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:37,759
than if if it were you know one of these

593
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,439
other

594
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:43,200
non-pathogenic species yes I agree I

595
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,259
agree and so in my in my opinion there

596
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,779
are maybe three uh three groups of fungi

597
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:51,000
that should be tested for let's say we

598
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:52,139
decided we don't want to do total sea of

599
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,240
fuse anymore

600
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,440
and we abandoned that approach and said

601
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,200
all right we're just going to Target

602
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,440
certain fungi that we know historically

603
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,500
have had an importance for humans

604
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,960
uh and could potentially cause problems

605
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,519
if they're present in flower or on

606
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,380
product one would definitely be

607
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:13,440
aspergillus again because of the

608
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,880
historical significance of aspergillus I

609
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,519
don't think anybody would argue that we

610
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,799
we should just exclude it that would be

611
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,259
turning a blind eye to to reports of

612
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:24,720
aspergillus causing disease the other is

613
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:27,359
fusarium we know there's fusarium on

614
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,640
cannabis and hemp uh we know fusarium

615
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,519
causes major problems on cereal and

616
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,280
other crops because of the toxins and

617
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,298
then the third is penicillium now

618
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:38,819
penicillium is a tough one because

619
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:40,558
there's so much of it and not all of it

620
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:42,298
is bad like I mentioned the cheese right

621
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:43,918
you've got you know penicillin on your

622
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:45,658
cheese if you eat a little bit of moldy

623
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,240
cheese you're going to be fine

624
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:51,059
so but if we are are going to Target

625
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,659
three organisms those would be the three

626
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:56,279
the rest of it just ignore it like it's

627
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,780
we're seeing those every day in our

628
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,639
diets it hasn't caused a problem

629
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:01,440
everywhere

630
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,380
um I can find

631
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,019
30 to 40 different species of Eastern

632
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,020
mold on any given cannabis flower

633
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:12,599
out of which maybe two is aspergillus

634
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,519
and one might be fusarium so really out

635
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,699
of that list of 40 I would only be

636
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,558
concerned with three those three I think

637
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,980
we should just test for those three

638
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:25,278
and let the others be as they may

639
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,259
um because a lot of times Growers use

640
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:31,079
beneficial products like trichoderma and

641
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:32,640
I and gliocladium and other fungi that

642
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:36,599
are registered they're allowed to be

643
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,278
used on cannabis they can cause yeast

644
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:41,158
yeast and mole numbers

645
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:43,019
so high that the product fails

646
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,820
so you're coming to me now and saying

647
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:46,980
I've treated this product with

648
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:50,158
trichoderma I haven't used any

649
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,440
pesticides this product is clean but

650
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,220
it's failing because it's got huge

651
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,640
numbers of spores of trichoderma which

652
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,620
is has been found to be okay for people

653
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,799
to to have

654
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:07,139
and so that's a dilemma if we're testing

655
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,139
just total use the vote if we're testing

656
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,538
for aspergillus 3 0 of the penicillium

657
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,880
the trichodoma one is going to pass yeah

658
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,859
and now now I know in the case of

659
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,919
aspergillus product is more familiar

660
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:22,259
with it that you know it it likely the

661
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,360
regulation wouldn't be just any form of

662
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:26,519
aspergillus because there's all sorts of

663
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,079
different species it would be those four

664
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,298
pathogenic ones that we had mentioned

665
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,839
before is it the same case

666
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:35,639
um with penicillium and fusarium

667
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,099
I would say yes I would I would say

668
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,440
there's there's like penicillin citronum

669
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:42,000
is one species that's very very common

670
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,460
that produces a number of these

671
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,819
mycotoxins and certainly in fusarium

672
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,679
there's a couple of three uh species

673
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:53,099
gremliner is definitely one of them and

674
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,240
pseudogram linear sport tracheoids I'm

675
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:56,519
just throwing these names out because

676
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,500
these are names that we know about so

677
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:00,778
yes for sure you wouldn't necessarily

678
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,119
want to go after every single cesarean

679
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:04,740
that may be there right um it would be

680
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,899
targeted towards the ones that we know

681
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,298
so really you're looking at about oh

682
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:13,620
three and three six maybe eight

683
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:17,339
eight or nine uh specific fungi that are

684
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:20,099
known to be harmful to humans that have

685
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:23,639
produced toxins and we should monitor

686
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:26,038
for those and um the others obviously

687
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,559
and then maybe set a limit of let's say

688
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,839
50 000 total cfus if if they were going

689
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,819
to use that yeah um and anything below

690
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,558
that don't worry about it but then uh

691
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,960
test for these seven or eight like we do

692
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,058
salmonella and E coli and so on we don't

693
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,400
test for Every bacteria that's present

694
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:42,899
well

695
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,759
in some states they do in some states

696
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,159
they do that's right they have the total

697
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,019
bacterial loads as well yeah right yeah

698
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,000
but luckily like you said those

699
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:53,639
thresholds are usually set pretty high

700
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,140
and that isn't one that uh Growers seem

701
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,940
to struggle with but total Easter mold

702
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,860
is and we did say that we were going to

703
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,259
talk about some of the factors that your

704
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:04,740
your team identified so let's get into

705
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:06,359
that and I think one of the major ones

706
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,220
um that you identified that was in this

707
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:09,298
paper was that the plant genetics

708
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,200
themselves

709
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:15,058
uh play a huge role in the tym levels

710
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,700
um I wonder if you could speak a bit to

711
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:20,759
that and is it specifically like the

712
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,798
physical structure of the plant and the

713
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,000
in the flowers that leads to that or is

714
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,099
there something else going on like does

715
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,440
it have something to do with immunity

716
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:30,298
yeah yeah so that that was a bit of a

717
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,400
surprise to us as well and I'm sort of

718
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:34,139
glad we really included like seven or

719
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,259
eight different types of genetics or

720
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,580
genotypes right in the study

721
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,500
um obviously we were grabbing whatever

722
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:42,240
whatever we could whatever was being

723
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,179
grown at the time so it wasn't a planned

724
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,900
experiment but we did find definite

725
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:50,880
differences between the the types of of

726
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,919
cannabis that were being grown primarily

727
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,320
it's to do with the morphology and the

728
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,179
size of the flower structure so the

729
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,599
larger the the flowers you know the

730
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:03,538
bigger the the mass if you wish or

731
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,759
volume the higher the yeast and mold in

732
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:07,798
general plants that produce very small

733
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,740
buds smaller buds many of them but

734
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:13,019
smaller in size not as dense seem to

735
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,538
have less over over East and low so

736
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:18,778
there was definitely this physical

737
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:20,819
um correlation in some cases I do think

738
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:24,000
there were chemical products chemicals

739
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:26,278
produced in the flower that would be

740
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,740
would be inhibiting yeast and moon I I

741
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,480
say that because

742
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,399
some some of these flowers were the

743
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,558
Eastern mold was so low

744
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,199
that it was almost impossible to explain

745
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,058
just from the fact that the flowers were

746
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,519
small I think they were secreting some

747
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:44,099
kind of a chemical product a natural

748
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,599
chemical product that was it was

749
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:48,798
preventing these Eastern walls from

750
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:51,538
growing if we knew what those were boy

751
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,278
maybe we'd be off to a really good start

752
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:54,658
from a research perspective I mean

753
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,220
definitely that's something that needs

754
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:59,278
to be looked at I don't think it's

755
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,778
something like terpenes or or some of

756
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,200
these other volatiles that we know it's

757
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:06,359
definitely not THC or CBD because all of

758
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,058
these were producing THC CBD something

759
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:11,158
else that that perhaps isn't on the

760
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,500
radar yet something that other

761
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,020
researchers or breeders may want to look

762
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,538
at but certainly flower structure flower

763
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:20,460
size and the reason though the larger

764
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:23,220
flowers seem to have more yeast and mold

765
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,860
is the humidity the moisture in those

766
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,079
flowers is higher by three to four

767
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:30,418
percent in terms of relative humidity

768
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:33,599
than the outside air and their

769
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:35,580
temperature builds up in the flower it's

770
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:39,058
almost a mini it's a mini Greenhouse

771
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:41,460
sitting on a flower on a plant because

772
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:43,980
it traps the solar radiation and it

773
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,919
warms up the buds warm up two three

774
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,480
degrees higher than the environment so

775
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,299
that humidity and moisture the

776
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,579
temperature creates this little

777
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:56,639
Greenhouse that allows these yeasts and

778
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:59,339
molds to build up so one thing we asked

779
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,100
ourselves well if you if you circulate

780
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:04,500
the air you know you turn a fan on close

781
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:06,599
to the plants and let this air here to

782
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,940
infiltrate through the flowers what

783
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:12,719
would happen and boy the easternmost

784
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,640
dropped by 90 a while now you can't go

785
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,798
out and put a fan next to every plant

786
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,320
but certainly you increase your your

787
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:22,319
airflow your air movement the humidity

788
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,139
drops the temperature drops and your

789
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,058
flowers have way less yeast and mode

790
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,640
and it's not impractical it's some

791
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:32,398
greenhouses you can set up 8 or 10 fans

792
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,580
blowing in a certain direction and that

793
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:39,538
will really reduce the yeast in milk

794
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:43,379
yeah and you know I'm I and I imagine

795
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:44,819
Growers too would be encouraged to to

796
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,620
hear you say that there could be

797
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,359
something more than just the morphology

798
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:49,139
of the buds that that's contributing to

799
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:51,000
it

800
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,840
um because I mean because if you think

801
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,538
about it Growers want big dense flowers

802
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,819
and to have that be associated with

803
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:02,640
higher tym well that's that's not good

804
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:04,379
news at all no no certainly and so the

805
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,600
chemicals are discovered which they will

806
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,640
be eventually uh that will be very very

807
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:11,398
useful because that's a natural way for

808
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,220
the plant to you know to protect itself

809
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:16,319
now plants don't have a an immune system

810
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,899
but they do secrete many many chemicals

811
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,538
and many of these chemicals are known to

812
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:24,719
inhibit the growth of mold and bacteria

813
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:28,200
and so on and so finding that um strain

814
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,700
or strains would be very useful yeah or

815
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,500
even you know putting that into a spray

816
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,058
of some kind or

817
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,220
um yeah

818
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:36,960
and one other thing that I saw in the

819
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,759
paper too is that you know in addition

820
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,740
to the density and the size of the buds

821
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:43,440
it was the number of leaves in the

822
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,140
actual flower too contributed to that as

823
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,759
well correct yeah so so this is the

824
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,000
first time I've actually taken an entire

825
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,619
flower apart using a pair of forceps and

826
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,419
scalpels sort of like a surgeon would

827
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,759
you know I took the flower and cut it up

828
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:58,500
into its various components and All

829
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:59,819
Growers will know that we've got these

830
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,859
bracks which are the sort of the

831
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:04,558
fluorescence leaves that surround the

832
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:06,658
the center of that of that female flower

833
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,460
and really the more the more

834
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:11,039
inflorescence these you have generally

835
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,259
speaking the higher your THC and CBD

836
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,658
because the trichomes are found in these

837
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:18,359
little breaks surrounding the the

838
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:20,039
pistols so I went through it and

839
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:22,678
literally cut them all out and started

840
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:24,658
counting them and the larger buttons had

841
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,360
more of these inflorescence leaves of

842
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:29,159
Brax again because it provides

843
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,038
protection against the flower and it

844
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:34,740
increases the humidity in there

845
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:38,579
so like you said the bigger flowers more

846
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:41,339
more total THC more CBD but also more of

847
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:43,619
these inflorescence leaves are building

848
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:45,480
up in there so visualize a flower

849
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,339
structure that's more open

850
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,220
where Eric can sort of filter through

851
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:52,259
it's got fewer leaves on the outside

852
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:55,440
lower yield definitely lower yield but

853
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:57,538
less tea it's less of yeast and milk so

854
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,278
it's sort of a trade-off right well you

855
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,679
don't want two small flowers you got no

856
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:04,558
yeast in law but then you've got no THC

857
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,720
or CBD so to speak yeah somewhere

858
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,539
there's a happy medium

859
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,398
yeah so I mean I guess in terms of so

860
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:13,800
for giving practical advice to Growers

861
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:15,418
who are trying to lower their tym

862
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,859
um in terms of plant genetics what

863
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:19,019
should they be thinking should they be

864
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:21,239
trying to select strains that you know

865
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:23,759
have certain morphology that are going

866
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,439
to be more favorable for lower levels

867
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,260
should they be increasing their airflow

868
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,760
what do you kind of advise yeah so I

869
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,040
think the breeding part is still a ways

870
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,260
off I mean I I'm sure there are Growers

871
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:37,019
that have made correlations with certain

872
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,359
strains are known to have higher yeast

873
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:41,280
and mold a lot of the strains

874
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,460
incidentally that have high yeast and

875
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,619
mold are also very sensitive to botritis

876
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,838
so Growers know which strains they grow

877
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,460
that have more botritis Bud rot they can

878
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:51,960
stay away from those because those are

879
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,780
the ones that are also going to build up

880
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,358
highest and mold go with your botritis

881
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,460
tolerance strains they would have a

882
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,500
tendency to have lower yeast and mold

883
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,619
because the flower structure is much

884
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,820
smaller more less dense

885
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:08,160
obviously keep the airflow happening

886
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,400
lower low our humidity is always good

887
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,920
for for both botritis and yeast in mold

888
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,019
don't leave a lot of leaf litter on the

889
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,700
floor right there's a Tendencies to just

890
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:19,920
cut leaves and drop them when the leaves

891
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:22,679
get dried out there's a ton of yeast and

892
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,139
mold that naturally start to grow on

893
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,838
that and anything that disturbs that

894
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:30,659
leaf litter on the on the bottom will

895
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:33,239
create some of these spores uh you know

896
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:34,858
flying up to the top of the flower now

897
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,838
you know flowers are sticky right

898
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:38,819
they're producing resin and we've shown

899
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:40,858
that if you have a lot of yeast in mold

900
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,480
in the air they'll actually land on the

901
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:45,000
flower and stick

902
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,159
they'll stick onto that resin and

903
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,260
they're they're not killed they're not

904
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:51,239
inactivated so those flowers when

905
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,099
they're taken into the lab and test it

906
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:55,319
for yeast and mold they actually have

907
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,838
higher levels because of the fact that

908
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,240
spores in the air were sticking to the

909
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,219
surface of that resin so that's

910
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,559
something else to obviously be aware of

911
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:06,838
during Harvest don't create a lot of

912
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,078
activity around the plants in terms of

913
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:12,179
too much shaking or too much jiggling

914
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:15,060
because that'll just create a Spore dust

915
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:18,000
if you wish that that will land and

916
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:19,920
stick to the to the flowers

917
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,679
yeah

918
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,300
sure sorry go ahead so as far as spray

919
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:26,578
sometimes people say well can I spray

920
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,140
zero tall or can I spray some chem some

921
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:29,700
product that's registered

922
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:32,400
I don't think it's a good idea because

923
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:33,919
you you're increasing the humidity uh

924
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,559
moisture level in that flower

925
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,059
particularly when it's closer to harvest

926
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:41,039
um so really there's not much you can do

927
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:43,519
from a treatment perspective to bring

928
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:47,579
those levels down

929
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:49,679
no and I and I understand too that a a

930
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:52,260
lot of it isn't so much what happens

931
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:55,379
during the growing of the plant but it's

932
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,839
in the post-harvest activities uh the

933
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,700
drying the curing and the trimming

934
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,219
um I wonder if you could speak a bit

935
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:04,078
about what you found around that sort of

936
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:05,399
uh activity yeah yeah so that that's a

937
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,019
that's another aspect that's super

938
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,940
important so let's leave the grower

939
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:10,440
aside you know you've you've picked up a

940
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,079
whole batch of

941
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,760
harvested flour and now you're deciding

942
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,220
how am I going to trim this do I want to

943
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,079
do you know the standard wet trim where

944
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:21,480
you push all the flowers through into uh

945
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,280
into a trimmer and then dry the

946
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,920
individual the buds or do you want to

947
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,660
hang dry where everything is left intact

948
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,000
and then you know the moisture is taken

949
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:32,940
out and then you can trim off your your

950
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,420
leaves we found a pretty uh big

951
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:39,000
difference between hang dry and and wet

952
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,760
shrimp the wet trim creates some damage

953
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,280
obviously to the to the leaves and

954
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,500
releases chemicals or or nutrients that

955
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,660
a lot of moles that might be present

956
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,159
particularly penicillium start to feed

957
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:52,618
on it and grow

958
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,379
so even on during the drying process

959
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:58,260
you're seeing buildup of these molds in

960
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,539
a flower that's been trimmed wet on the

961
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,700
other hand when you dry this thing first

962
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:05,820
uh you're not allowing these these wound

963
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:08,219
sites or broken off leaves as a source

964
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,338
for mold and yeast to get in the entire

965
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:13,618
flower structure is dried you've you've

966
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:15,719
eliminated 90 percent of your yeast in

967
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:18,720
mold and then when you start trimming it

968
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:20,519
as a dry trim we found the the eastern

969
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,439
wall levels were way lower

970
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,320
so that's one thing that definitely will

971
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,940
make a difference a lot of Growers are

972
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,099
using the handguard system they'll

973
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,320
probably find they don't have as many as

974
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,539
much issues with yeast and mold

975
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,460
we didn't look at anything beyond that

976
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:38,338
in other words you know the curing

977
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,740
process or the packaging and storing

978
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:43,139
process I think All Growers know that

979
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:44,939
when you store inappropriate humidity or

980
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:47,159
temperatures you're gonna get build up

981
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,619
of Eastern mold and they know that if

982
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,239
you cure them too long or under high

983
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,099
moisture you're going to get yeast and

984
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,799
mold so we didn't really look at that

985
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,480
aspect we kind of stopped right at the

986
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,460
point where the flowers had been trimmed

987
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,519
whether it's wet or dry and then

988
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,800
collected data from that

989
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,619
no that's interesting so do you have any

990
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,019
idea like in terms of percentage what

991
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,640
Growers are typically doing is it more

992
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:13,619
common for them to be doing wet trimming

993
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,719
versus dry they're shifting a lot

994
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,220
towards dry trim because it's less work

995
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,899
in a sense you know you can bring the

996
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,819
flowers into the dryer rooms hang them

997
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,639
and then and then deal with them later

998
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:26,039
the drying process itself is very

999
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:28,078
detrimental to easternmost which is

1000
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,539
obviously a good thing you know when you

1001
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,700
have dry herbs and dry products dried

1002
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:34,199
figs and they tend to last a lot longer

1003
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:37,319
because the moisture is taken out of

1004
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:39,000
them similarly with dried flour the

1005
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,519
problem is that you never get down to

1006
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,380
zero I've never seen a dried flower get

1007
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,000
down to zero more yeast and more there's

1008
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,519
always a fraction that still hangs

1009
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,679
around and that that population can

1010
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,539
always build up later on if if the

1011
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,578
storage conditions aren't right

1012
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:57,179
but if you're coming in with a very high

1013
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:59,339
Eastern mold load then nothing you do

1014
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:01,259
after harvest it's going to bring all of

1015
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:03,599
it down to zero so there's two two

1016
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,520
components try to reduce the Eastern

1017
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,920
mold while you're growing and then after

1018
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,780
you harvest and bring it in try to do

1019
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,240
things that will reduce the yeast amount

1020
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,579
even further in that in that product

1021
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,379
that you're handling

1022
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:19,500
yeah and I have to imagine that leaf

1023
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,660
litter too would be a big consideration

1024
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,358
during the trimming process

1025
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:26,639
yes and even having too many leaves on

1026
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:29,338
there can't create problems for not

1027
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,078
enough moisture drying and so on so hang

1028
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:33,420
drying has to be done carefully because

1029
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:35,160
that you've got way more plant material

1030
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,659
and you want to make sure that all of it

1031
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:40,920
gets down to I don't know 12 to 14

1032
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:43,559
moisture so that you're not leaving

1033
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,680
remnants of yeast and mold even in the

1034
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:49,078
hang dry samples

1035
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:51,179
um I would say over over the year of

1036
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,280
study like we looked at maybe

1037
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:55,639
I don't know two to three thousand

1038
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,740
samples if everything is done right

1039
00:40:55,639 --> 00:41:00,719
samples are are not too much yeast and

1040
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:02,699
mold in the beginning

1041
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,659
um they're a hang dried and carefully

1042
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:07,500
handled

1043
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:10,259
in the entire batch of 2000 samples I

1044
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:13,619
would say the average yeast and mold was

1045
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,020
around 2000. so 2000 would be sort of

1046
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:17,880
the average that you would expect

1047
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:19,679
everything was done right you know you

1048
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,599
brought things in properly they were

1049
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,899
hand-dried and trimmed and so on and so

1050
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,420
forth 2000 is doable in Most states and

1051
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:31,440
definitely doable in most most countries

1052
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:33,000
but never will it ever go down to zero

1053
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,400
yeah I know and I was going to ask you

1054
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,838
too about the you were mentioning the

1055
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,000
hang drying and they're being kind of

1056
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:40,500
leaves and kind of creating the maybe

1057
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,579
the moisture environment that's similar

1058
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,858
to what you were talking about during

1059
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:45,599
growing so with that in mind important

1060
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:47,578
to have good air circulation when you're

1061
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,220
doing the hang drying as well totally

1062
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:52,380
totally and in fact we actually see an

1063
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,239
explosion of Eastern Rome when the

1064
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,920
plants first enter the driver the drying

1065
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,899
room because there's so much on there

1066
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,820
that they just start moving around so

1067
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,980
you're right get the airflow happening

1068
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:05,280
make sure it's a it's a long process

1069
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:06,960
seven days five to seven days uh get the

1070
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,519
moisture out measure the moisture in

1071
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,460
there to make sure it's low enough

1072
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,559
before we take it out and start trimming

1073
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,539
it for for final product

1074
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:18,299
there are pockets of Eastern mold in

1075
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:20,460
there I have seen in some in some of the

1076
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,160
flowers for some reason there's little

1077
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,980
pockets where you're looking at 10 15

1078
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:28,980
000 cfus per gram but if it's fried

1079
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,019
properly uh it should go down to between

1080
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,358
two to five

1081
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:35,759
I would say is a good number that

1082
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:39,179
anybody would be happy with yeah no

1083
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,520
absolutely and as you said you're never

1084
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:43,919
going to get down to zero unless you

1085
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,079
maybe do some irradiation

1086
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,940
um I don't know what kind of experience

1087
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,680
you have with that or if you have

1088
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,900
thoughts on that I know it's sort of a

1089
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:54,179
touchy subject in in the yeah so so

1090
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:58,079
that's allowed in Canada we're allowed

1091
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:59,639
to irradiate with e-beam radiation I

1092
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,579
have looked at samples before and after

1093
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,858
from the perspective of Eastern mold uh

1094
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,440
it's pretty much zero after it's been

1095
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:10,078
irradiated what does it do to the final

1096
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,480
product uh people that have used it

1097
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,300
would say that it doesn't really alter

1098
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,059
too much of the the cannabinoid profiles

1099
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:20,700
it may perhaps impact some of the

1100
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:22,139
terpenes but overall they they're

1101
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:24,659
finding not a significant difference

1102
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:27,000
between irradiated and not from a from

1103
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:28,259
an organoleptic perspective the problem

1104
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,480
is the cost

1105
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,280
it's really expensive to go through and

1106
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,079
treat all the product unless you

1107
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,780
absolutely have to for example if you're

1108
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,180
exporting and it's a requirement for

1109
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,940
zero zero mode that you you would have

1110
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:44,098
to do that but it's it's expensive

1111
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,720
um there's there's other ways and I

1112
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:47,160
think the article we published was

1113
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:50,159
trying to address what are these other

1114
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:52,440
ways that could minimize your yeast and

1115
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,838
mold levels without having to resort to

1116
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,420
things like

1117
00:43:53,838 --> 00:44:00,358
irradiation afterwards

1118
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,119
yeah and which I know there's different

1119
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:06,719
types of irradiation which ones were you

1120
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,818
looking at is it ozone or no we looked

1121
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,500
at uh Electron Beam radiation even

1122
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:12,179
radiation I haven't looked at ozone

1123
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,838
people have talked about ozone there's

1124
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:17,699
also plasma cold plasma treatments

1125
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:19,980
um the Israelis the Israeli researchers

1126
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:21,719
have done a good good studies on that

1127
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,480
they've published a couple of papers on

1128
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:27,118
different forms of radiation that that

1129
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,179
are effective and most of them do very

1130
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,760
similar results to to e-beam radiation

1131
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:34,559
that we've looked at but there is a cost

1132
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,540
factor that is there's also the handling

1133
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,159
Vector right you gotta then take your

1134
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:40,259
products move them over to the site

1135
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,659
that's being uh created and then bring

1136
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,900
them back for for packaging and so on

1137
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:47,578
yeah yeah absolutely all right but it

1138
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,619
does seem like There's Hope here that

1139
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:51,480
you know if if best practices are

1140
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:54,059
followed then you should be able to

1141
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,579
hopefully get underneath the the

1142
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:59,639
threshold as as long as your state has

1143
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:02,039
set a realistic one I think so now we

1144
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:03,598
haven't talked about outside growth oh

1145
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:05,759
yeah that's that's another story

1146
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,980
altogether because you have so little

1147
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,260
control over the weather if you get

1148
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,300
rained on if it's a you know a series of

1149
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,940
Hot 100 degree weather with high

1150
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,740
humidity uh it's almost impossible to

1151
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,780
manage Eastern world that's really

1152
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:20,519
unfortunate and I don't have any

1153
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,800
suggestions or recommendations there

1154
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:25,079
because I haven't worked with outdoor

1155
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,180
growing cannabis uh in terms of yeast

1156
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,818
and mold uh it would be definitely more

1157
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:31,980
challenging uh to to manage those those

1158
00:45:29,818 --> 00:45:34,259
plants

1159
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:37,500
yeah I can tell you as someone who has

1160
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:40,560
grown in the Northeast and had plants

1161
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:43,500
that finish in October it can be very

1162
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,818
tough to to manage mold yeah and you

1163
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,039
know something just occurred to me maybe

1164
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:49,559
there should be a criteria for

1165
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,559
um regulations indoor cannabis versus

1166
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:54,599
outdoor where there's more leniency on

1167
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,420
the on the indoor because you know that

1168
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,920
the the eastern wall pressure overall is

1169
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,318
going to be lower indoors if

1170
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,220
everything's done the way it should be

1171
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,679
outdoors maybe that's a different

1172
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:06,779
scenario so I don't know if the

1173
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:09,539
Regulatory Agencies consider a method of

1174
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:12,000
production or not uh there could be some

1175
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:13,980
way to discriminate uh indoor or

1176
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,858
differentiate I should say differentiate

1177
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,900
indoor grown versus outdoors in terms of

1178
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:20,460
potentially having lower

1179
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:23,460
um cfus

1180
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,380
yeah no that's a great Point all right

1181
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,900
Samir uh do you want to be very mindful

1182
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,460
of your time and um I already know that

1183
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,019
I'm going to be putting a link to the

1184
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,818
paper in the show description for people

1185
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:34,318
to check out because there's a ton more

1186
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:35,940
information in there that we didn't get

1187
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,800
a chance to get to

1188
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,920
um but in addition to that if you have

1189
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:43,140
any other resources or

1190
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,460
um or research that you'd like to share

1191
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:46,318
with the folks and that I could put

1192
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,720
links to uh please let me know and then

1193
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,279
of course any ways that people can maybe

1194
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,379
get in touch with you or follow the work

1195
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,079
that you're doing please plug away

1196
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,818
sure I appreciate that and again it's an

1197
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,818
exciting field to be in because there's

1198
00:46:56,818 --> 00:47:01,920
there's so much to learn and um the idea

1199
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:03,659
of exchanging information to me is is

1200
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,059
very important uh the the fact that

1201
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:07,739
we're talking today is because I want

1202
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:10,259
the information to get out there I want

1203
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:12,539
it to be used uh you you guys have a

1204
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,160
good way of disseminating it and the

1205
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:16,500
more we share the more we know the more

1206
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,299
we understand and the more we can manage

1207
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,338
these these problems these problems are

1208
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,500
not new they've been around for

1209
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:25,019
centuries uh since the day cannabis was

1210
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,599
first Grown I suspect the yeast and mold

1211
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:30,059
tolerance was much higher back then

1212
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,680
um than it is now but we need to we need

1213
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:32,818
to know we need to study and we need to

1214
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,219
share

1215
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:37,619
absolutely no and we appreciate you

1216
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:40,439
