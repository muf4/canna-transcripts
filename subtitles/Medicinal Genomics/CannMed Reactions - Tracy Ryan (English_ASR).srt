2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:12,660
I learned a lot more about epilepsy

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,048
since this was more epilepsy focused so

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,000
I learned more about dosing and side

5
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:20,550
effects from different drugs that can

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,679
make beautiful and avenues to to cause

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,719
issues with fluctuations in medicine so

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,058
it was interesting I got enlightened in

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,549
a field that I understand but I'm not as

10
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,050
educated so I'm really honored to be

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,850
here and be able to meet all these

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,740
incredible people most of these lectures

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:48,819
and amazing
