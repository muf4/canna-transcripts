1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,960
wow that was an excellent talk really

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,480
excellent talk I didn't know I was going

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,240
to have to follow such a great talk um I

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,640
appreciate that talk um my name's hun

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,399
land uh thank you for having me again

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,518
this year uh thank you to the organizers

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:25,439
and all the beautiful people here um I'm

8
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:27,799
going to speak today about some

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,000
advancements in conoid based research

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,840
and give some insights uh from

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,799
rigorously designed studies and also

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,079
some not so much rigorously designed

13
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:39,078
studies let's

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,160
see U that was quicker

15
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,159
than what's

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,479
happening

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,320
okay now we go all right uh a couple

18
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,558
disclosures I've been in Industry about

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,558
20 years um 12 focus on cannabinoid

20
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:07,679
since starting uh with GW Pharma in

21
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:09,959
2012 um I'm the VP for BRC I also act as

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,159
a chief scientific officer for the NHL

23
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,599
alumni as well as do some lecturing and

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,719
sit on some other boards um but now on

25
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,839
to the interesting uh I think

26
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,359
interesting section uh so first I'm

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,960
going to talk for those of you that

28
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,719
don't know the FDA recently put out a

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,000
publication on an update on inds around

30
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,640
cannabis and cannabinoids so I think

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
it's important to just run through that

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,359
to give you kind of a glimmer into where

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,159
the FDA is with current cannabis

34
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,959
thinking uh then I'm going to talk about

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
the challenges of research I think many

36
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,959
of you are aware of these challenges but

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,439
I'm going to put some of them not all of

38
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,519
them just kind of in one place to help

39
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,319
us understand how we really should be

40
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,640
evaluating these Publications and how we

41
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,599
may use that information and how that

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,920
information may bring more questions um

43
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,559
and then finally I'm going to dive into

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,680
uh kind of the clinical trial update

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,439
talk a little bit about the landscape

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
and then finally I'm going to discuss

47
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,719
the trial that we have ongoing one of

48
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,479
the the four um that I can speak about

49
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:17,120
today I had hoped to provide you with

50
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:19,719
data on this study but um as you know uh

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,360
Contracting with lawyers can take a

52
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:26,878
little bit longer than one might expect

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,239
so all right so the FDA long history

54
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:33,039
with FDA and cannabis um we've got about

55
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,878
800 inds that have been keyword

56
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:39,719
submitted since

57
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:43,759
1970 400 from 1970 to 2010 and then

58
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:47,439
another 400 so doubles from 2010 to

59
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:50,799
2023 this uh represents about a 300%

60
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:53,120
increase in the last 10 years um and

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,560
they did State kind of in the small area

62
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,158
many submissions were unable to meet the

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,878
indd requirements so they didn't really

64
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,318
tell us how many were unable to meet but

65
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,679
many um and one thing I'll just point

66
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:08,238
out here is they have this nice graph

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,159
and you can see this section over here

68
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,280
addiction and pain is kind of lumped

69
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,798
into one so I have some questions about

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,479
you know how much of this is abuse

71
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,959
liability work versus actually

72
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,639
therapeutic treatments I'll dive into

73
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,400
that in just a

74
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,639
minute then they this other very

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,319
interesting lovely graphical uh

76
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,919
presentation of the changes throughout

77
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,598
history so we have a lot the first two

78
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,479
decades all smoked and then we start

79
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,639
seeing some other formats come in and

80
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,878
then lo and behold look at this like

81
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,919
almost everything you can think of we've

82
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,560
got

83
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,158
sweets and baked goods so a lot of inds

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,199
going in I don't know how many of these

85
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:53,878
have been approved I know some of them

86
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,318
have um but a lot of inds going on

87
00:03:53,878 --> 00:04:00,560
different formats different constituents

88
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,560
so again interesting

89
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,400
so I have questions um which is normal

90
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,519
for me anytime I read anything I always

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
have questions uh some of the questions

92
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,079
I have here is how many inds around

93
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,359
canabo have actually been approved how

94
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,358
many of these studies are looking at

95
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,280
theraputic V benefit versus risk I mean

96
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,439
I see a lot of studies on driving or you

97
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,959
know do you prefer this drug over that

98
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:30,279
drug is it addictive etc etc um so again

99
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,519
if we're looking at canid research for

100
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,359
therapy it may be smaller than

101
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,478
represented here in this particular um

102
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,319
publication and then secondly I would

103
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,000
say how many of these imps or these

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,959
investigational Medical Products could

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,519
actually become a pharmaceutical so I

106
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,120
know from conversations with the FDA

107
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,359
smoked cannabis or even vaporized

108
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,680
cannabis the voc's emitted will most

109
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,400
likely not ever meet the level of an

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,759
approved drug so while it's great um and

111
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,319
there is you know a very nice Pathway to

112
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,080
using medical cannabis as an inhal

113
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,560
product as far as being able to get that

114
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,120
approved by the FDA and reimbursed by

115
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,160
Insurance it does not appear currently

116
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,079
likely and we can argue about the merits

117
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,240
of that if we if you want but that's the

118
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,758
current FDA standing so maybe an

119
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,800
inhalation device but again I'm not

120
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,360
aware of that technology certainly I

121
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,079
think it would be tough to have FDA

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,960
approved THC cookies and stuff like that

123
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,879
so a lot of questions um and then if you

124
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,478
dive down a little further then you

125
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,719
wonder how many of these inds were for

126
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,800
specific products so typically we would

127
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,840
attach an investigation new drug

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,800
application to a indication so for

129
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,119
epidex there's D there's lenux gesto

130
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,960
there's tuberos crosis and a number of

131
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,879
other indications like

132
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,758
Parkinson's uh and several other

133
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,918
research studies that have used

134
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,360
epidex which would have different indd

135
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,879
numbers so we could have at least 10 or

136
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,639
15 different inds for epidex same thing

137
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:06,680
for Marinol same thing for satc so um

138
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,759
the bucket of actual indd research for

139
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,840
Therapeutics may be much smaller than is

140
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,639
exhibited in this particular

141
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,038
paper um but what this does tell me is

142
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,120
that the FDA is supportive of canono

143
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,639
research we clearly have inds whether

144
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,800
it's for therapeutic benefit or whether

145
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,598
it's for abuse liability that have been

146
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,280
approved I personally have these

147
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:30,079
approved right now and have not had a

148
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,038
big

149
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,560
difficulty with the agency although you

150
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:37,038
do have to respond very quickly to their

151
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,000
questions and and that may be cumbersome

152
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,680
at times uh because they give you a

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,879
couple days maybe uh to give you those

154
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,079
responses you must meet the CMC

155
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,839
standards um most people can't meet

156
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,478
those standards but it can be done and

157
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,239
you have to have sufficient documents so

158
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,360
investigator brochures protocols icfs

159
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,639
and if they don't like something like

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,560
recently they told me blood pressure

161
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:04,400
above 150 needed to be blood pressure

162
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,000
above or below 140 so um they do make

163
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:10,439
these these um kind of suggestions

164
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,279
around protocol design not just CMC Etc

165
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:13,800
and then there are just some forms uh

166
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:18,079
1571

167
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,520
1572 3674 Etc so uh it is a process

168
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,120
there's a 30-day review period as long

169
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,639
as you don't go on clinical hold after

170
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,959
30-day you're free to run the trial um

171
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,800
they could put you on clinical hold at

172
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:31,399
any time but um we haven't seen that so

173
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,120
uh just make sure you have sufficient

174
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:38,239
time to respond to these uh

175
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,360
questions all right so now we've got

176
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,360
that out of the

177
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,720
way I'm going to talk about challenges

178
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,280
um I I spend several hours a day I have

179
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,560
alerts on Google with every new study

180
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,679
that gets published I work with

181
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,918
researchers they tell me you know what

182
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,879
they're working on and when it's going

183
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:59,079
to be published so I look at these and I

184
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,240
try to glean knowledge about how this

185
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,478
could translate to research in certain

186
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,038
indications and the main thing that I

187
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:09,918
find that just as added variables for me

188
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:13,000
understanding how to use these data are

189
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:15,839
things like route of administration the

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,759
product consistency the format uh is

191
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,758
there a control group and how does this

192
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,199
impact the interpretation of data uh so

193
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,280
I I say this often cannabis is not

194
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,879
cannabis is not cannabis I think we all

195
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:32,679
know that the here but when you see a

196
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,639
paper that says cannabis treats pain I'm

197
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,519
like okay what cannabis are you using

198
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,598
and what pain are you studying so there

199
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,519
a lot of different variables just in

200
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,039
that example um and you get significant

201
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,440
variability based on route of

202
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:49,039
administration so smoking for pain is

203
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,880
different than uh oral Administration

204
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,319
certainly vehicles uh can have a big

205
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:58,159
difference so if you look here this is

206
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,640
SS versus MCT for the record MCT

207
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,000
bypasses lymphatic absor absorption and

208
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:06,319
has the lowest bioavailability of any

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,159
lipid that you use um whereas you can

210
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,120
see rapid absorption with SS not saying

211
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,879
you should use SS but clearly there's a

212
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,320
difference so if I take 5 milligrams of

213
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:19,480
THC and it's in SS format versus MCT

214
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,920
then I can expect a very different

215
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,000
effect um and and and that may lead to

216
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:29,679
efficacy right so 10 milligrams is not

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,399
10 milligrams is not 10 milligrams

218
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,559
um and then finally uh lack of proper

219
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,399
controls and that's kind of the outlier

220
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,958
here but what I want to say is we see a

221
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,519
lot of studies that are uh where we look

222
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:46,479
at um research and it's um with no

223
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,360
control so kind of proof of concept uh

224
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,920
does this work right so let's say 10

225
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,200
patients and that's great because likely

226
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,199
at a minimum you're going to get a

227
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,680
placebo response 20% 30% 10% something

228
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,680
people just even in studies where people

229
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:03,439
say we're going to to give you a

230
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:05,399
placebo and rate your pain people still

231
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,800
get reductions in pain even though they

232
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,519
know they're taking a placebo so in this

233
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,199
case we're giving them cannabis so

234
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,839
there's even a higher potential for a

235
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,959
placebo effect the problem is yes you

236
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,279
may get a win in your study but if

237
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,359
there's a side effect let's say you get

238
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,439
a skin rash and there's 10 people well

239
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,480
then all of a sudden that's

240
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,240
disproportional to what may actually

241
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,519
happen so if you have a control group

242
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,720
and you get four skin rashes well maybe

243
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,440
it's just the clinic and there was a

244
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,440
skin fungus going around right but if if

245
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,839
if you don't have a control then

246
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,399
essentially all that could be

247
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,440
contributed to your drug and as you know

248
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,480
if you use these types of studies to

249
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,200
support a sponsor indd then the FDA very

250
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,320
much could say well you know there's

251
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,040
some serious safety concerns here based

252
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,480
on your adverse event profile because

253
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:59,360
you have no control to say well actually

254
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,360
this is the same as placebo

255
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,799
that is a laser sorry for Bonnie I think

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,078
I just shot you with the

257
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:12,159
laser okay um so this is an in this is

258
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:14,439
sat ofx so I try to pull I try to pull

259
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,600
at least one variable out right so this

260
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,600
is a no medicine it's consistent at

261
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,920
satex and the title was um effective

262
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,120
canono on neuropathic

263
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,679
pain and so I dove in and you can

264
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,720
see here pretty clearly you get some

265
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:33,439
separation so here's the L line and then

266
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,079
as you move this way favors intervention

267
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,200
so looks pretty good generally speaking

268
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:42,638
um I dove in a little bit deeper and

269
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,519
even though they're under the Skies of

270
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,320
neuropathic pain they're actually quite

271
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,919
different indications so chemo-induced

272
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,399
peripheral neuropathy rheumatoid

273
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,879
arthritis like clearly different

274
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,879
pathophysiologies there Ms related pain

275
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:02,320
aladia diabetic peripheral neuropathic

276
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:05,759
pain Ms Central neuropathic pain and

277
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,160
peripheral neuropathic pain so um the

278
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,360
same but different and we're seeing

279
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,039
different changes so again if you look

280
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,800
here

281
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:19,278
dpmp not so good but if I looked at Ms

282
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,599
pain and I just assumed that sat of X

283
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,480
will work for this um maybe not as much

284
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,159
right maybe maybe we have to be a little

285
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,839
bit specific and think about Theology of

286
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,000
pain and maybe it does work maybe it was

287
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,000
a study design issue but I don't think

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,198
we can just say broadly um this works

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,639
the same across these conditions clearly

290
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,639
there's some

291
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:49,278
variation all right this is a really

292
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:51,639
interesting study kind of Builds on the

293
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,679
indication this is cersei's work and I

294
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,639
haven't seen Cersei here but I I love

295
00:12:53,679 --> 00:13:00,958
this study because I keep seeing work on

296
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,879
CBD and a lot of times the doses are

297
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,518
what I would say far sub therapeutic so

298
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:10,720
what she did is she looked at all the

299
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,839
rcts and the green dots are success you

300
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,399
can see the indications here and the

301
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,079
orange dots are not

302
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:21,278
successful and what she found is that

303
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:24,000
the doses typically for Success acutely

304
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:27,679
are between 300 and 1200 milligrams a

305
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,320
day and when you have repeat dosing uh

306
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,759
that goes down a little bit so you can

307
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,278
see repeat

308
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:36,439
dosing you probably get a kind of a

309
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:38,958
higher level of steady state so this

310
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,040
more or less confirms for most

311
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,638
conditions you need much more CBD on

312
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:48,198
board or at least I would say to

313
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,198
optimize cbd's effect I think we need

314
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:54,799
much more CBD um and you can see

315
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,799
sometimes you use these high amounts and

316
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,319
they still don't work right and I I

317
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,919
think that like schizophrenia I think

318
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,199
they're missing a couple positive

319
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,360
studies there again it's not my paper

320
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:07,278
but you can see the general Trend and so

321
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,959
it makes me a little bit frustrated when

322
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,039
you see a study that you know we've used

323
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,439
a sub therpeutic Dr I mean the worst

324
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:16,559
thing in research for me is when you

325
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,680
don't answer any questions a failed

326
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,559
study at least you know when it's

327
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:21,838
convoluted and you have no answers

328
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,359
that's a

329
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,120
problem um oh and then if you look at

330
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,240
this bottom corner when they correlate

331
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,959
to plasma levels again not many studies

332
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,320
but you can see plasma level versus

333
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:37,239
success looks much better here than the

334
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,040
lowd dose studies so again maybe

335
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:44,198
underdosing

336
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:46,278
CBD all right this is one of my favorite

337
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,319
um sections to talk about and nobody

338
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:54,559
really likes statistics or statistics as

339
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,560
many people say um so in research I see

340
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,000
just continually especially in cannabis

341
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,719
I see these things it's like

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,120
statistically

343
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,040
improved something and you look at the P

344
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,120
value and you're like oh my gosh P value

345
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,120
less than 0.5 this must be real and and

346
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,159
it is real right like no doubt I I mean

347
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,959
you can question some of the data but if

348
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,159
you're getting positive P values that's

349
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:19,000
a positive thing so basically as most of

350
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,799
us know this indicates whether the

351
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,039
observed effect was just by chance and

352
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:27,078
we test it with an noas or T Test right

353
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:29,039
typically the threshold is about 05 for

354
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:31,799
those of you who don't know that

355
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,439
basically means if we ran this study 100

356
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,799
times then we would expect this effect

357
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,480
95 times which is pretty good the odds

358
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:42,120
are in your favor that this is a real

359
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,839
effect um but it doesn't convey

360
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,399
practical significance or the magnitude

361
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,319
of effect which I think is something we

362
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,278
often

363
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:54,719
miss on the contrary effect size means

364
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:56,838
how big is the observed effect which is

365
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,440
great which could be statistically

366
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,199
significant or not based on the data

367
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,360
um and it gives real world Insight so

368
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:07,958
like Dustin if he sees a paper and he's

369
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,560
seeing a 50% Improvement in something

370
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,559
and statistical significant he's

371
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,119
probably going to feel a lot better

372
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,119
about that paper than if he sees a 5%

373
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,278
improvement with statistical significant

374
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,318
so I'd say clinical meaning of seeing

375
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,799
this magnitude very important for

376
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:25,479
clinical practice certainly important

377
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:26,719
for research um so as I mentioned uh you

378
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,360
can have something that works that

379
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,839
doesn't have a big magnitude you can

380
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,839
have something has a big magnitude

381
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,959
that's not statistically significant so

382
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,680
we still don't know if it's by chance or

383
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:42,078
not and that's one way they work

384
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:45,039
together to interpret studies now next

385
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,838
I'm going to talk about a study that um

386
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,679
I was excited about so if you guys know

387
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:54,000
me I I love minor canabo I love the idea

388
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:56,799
of rational poly Pharmacy or super

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,720
additive effects or potential Entourage

390
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,120
or nourage so when this came out I was

391
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,759
like oh great what happens CBN and CBD

392
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,880
or CBN alone what happens in

393
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,519
sleep so I looked at it it's double

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,240
blind randomized Placebo controlled

395
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:13,119
study they looked at a 20 mgram gummy of

396
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,640
CBN um I thought that was low most of

397
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,438
the binding says it's like one 20th the

398
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,839
potency of THC um but that's a side but

399
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,720
I see these numbers and this is kind of

400
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,038
verbatim from the paper it did not hit

401
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,078
on primary endpoint but they said

402
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,839
significant improvements in reducing

403
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,798
Awakenings 005

404
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,599
significant improvements in sleep

405
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:37,798
disturbance

406
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:40,199
02 okay I'm excited let me read more so

407
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:44,119
I go and I look and they have these

408
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,558
graphs I look here this is the CBN group

409
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:48,159
alone and these are the combinations and

410
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,440
you can see this has moved over I look

411
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:56,440
at the scale difference from

412
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,960
Placebo um let's see right and and and I

413
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,159
come up here and it looks like it's

414
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:05,840
about a half but but clearly over this

415
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:08,640
line right so I look down at the next

416
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:11,359
one and I come over here and I'm like

417
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,640
okay good about another one difference

418
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,399
from Placebo the scale from four and two

419
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,120
okay so I'm like okay well that's

420
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,840
interesting not familiar with these

421
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:28,798
scales let me look into the scales a

422
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:31,439
bit and uh ultimately what you see is

423
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,319
the first scale was Awakenings right so

424
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,120
number of Awakenings so we had a

425
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:40,038
reduction of 0.5 Awakenings a night so

426
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,678
every other night you wake up one less

427
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,000
time I maybe that's meaningful maybe

428
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,400
it's not it's not a lot of Awakenings to

429
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
be honest um and then I looked at the

430
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,240
scale they Ed for sleep disturbance and

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,679
their Baseline was 15.1 and I think we

432
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:00,400
landed at about 14 so this is a 20 point

433
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:04,080
scale so we got a a a one point

434
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,559
reduction in a 20o scale statistically

435
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,639
significant but like I don't think that

436
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,798
we can say that 20 milligram gummy is

437
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,480
now like the best new sleep aid like it

438
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:15,879
it's just it's not that much I I I

439
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,679
suspect if you would have done this with

440
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,480
Delta 9 THC we would have a much better

441
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,679
much more interesting result than this

442
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,440
maybe if we went higher with CBN we

443
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,320
would have much better

444
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,919
result don't know but so what do we have

445
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,558
in this St study we have control group

446
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,720
that's great we've got a control group

447
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:38,038
I'm happy with that format I don't know

448
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,759
if 20 mg of CBN has gotten into these

449
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:43,000
patients or not like I I have no idea

450
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,919
because I know if you put it in syrup

451
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,679
and you eat it I mean Ryan vry did that

452
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,600
study with CBD and jam and like it was

453
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,519
non- detecting the blood so I don't know

454
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:56,119
do they have is this a s's gummy or is

455
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,319
this just like a gummy um indication it

456
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,639
was

457
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:02,439
self-reported it was self-reported poor

458
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,000
sleep so I do you have sleep apnea

459
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,320
restless leg syndrome or you just having

460
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
trouble sleep like I so again like I

461
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:15,639
don't know this piece either and then

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,440
finally is it does it have both

463
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,320
statistical significance and a

464
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,200
meaningful effect size and I I just

465
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,439
don't think so I I wanted something

466
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,558
really new and exciting with a minor

467
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,038
canabo you know and

468
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,440
CBN is is available right right it's

469
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:36,240
just it's a degreg product of THC it's

470
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,320
just old THC so um it's easy we could

471
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,240
easily research this it's not like we're

472
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,439
looking at CBT which is really hard to

473
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,960
get it's like oh we could get this but

474
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,279
based on this it doesn't look

475
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,558
exceedingly

476
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,678
positive all right so let's talk about

477
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:55,240
some rigorously designed studies not all

478
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,038
of them are positive um this is the

479
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,159
first one is related to kidney stone

480
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:03,919
pain and um it was a 20 mgram CBD

481
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,280
Intervention which just makes me sad

482
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,159
because they had funding for 90 patients

483
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,639
to do a 90 patient randomized controlled

484
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,278
study and they used 20 milligrams of of

485
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
CBD for

486
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:19,159
pain uh standard everything was standard

487
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,400
it was designed well just the dosing

488
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:24,840
wasn't right and basically we saw

489
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,559
nothing in fact Placebo looked slightly

490
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,798
better in all these

491
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,319
outcomes and it makes me sad because you

492
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:34,440
know we could have used something else

493
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:37,519
or something more than 20 milligram CBD

494
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,480
but well-designed study just didn't get

495
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,278
a cannaboid person in there to say hey

496
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,519
we should talk about

497
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:49,200
dosing another one um this is uh this

498
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,798
was a alcohol use disorder study use

499
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,038
disorder study with

500
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:57,278
PTSD they used a dose that I would think

501
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:00,000
would be in the range to see efficacy if

502
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:04,359
it works I 600 milligram

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,200
CBD pretty robust study um they did not

504
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:09,038
show they did not give the stats that so

505
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,840
I got this from Clinical trials.gov it's

506
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,720
not been published but they gave the

507
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,000
outcomes and just based on looking at

508
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,720
the outcomes and drink reduction and

509
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,960
heavy drinking days and patients without

510
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,120
heavy drinking we're really not seeing

511
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,400
anything we see a little bit with the

512
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,278
PCL 5 score at the end which isn't

513
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,360
related to drinking that's related to

514
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:34,480
PTSD but generally speaking no big hits

515
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:36,918
um based on this study I wouldn't

516
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,519
suggest that CBD is going to stop people

517
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,799
with PTSD from from drinking that

518
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,558
doesn't look particularly positive so

519
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:46,200
again well-designed studies I think we

520
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,158
answered the question or at least to

521
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,000
some degree answered the question had

522
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,159
there been THC present or CBG present

523
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,200
this may be a very different outcome but

524
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,000
CBD

525
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,759
alone not looking good for um for U

526
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,960
alcohol use

527
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,679
disorder also we've got recently

528
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,159
terminated studies that were welld

529
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,960
designed so the first one was the

530
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,559
release study the MS study um spasticity

531
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,840
they were counting spasms which actually

532
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,839
counting spasms is quite hard um because

533
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,158
it's not like seizures um or most

534
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:24,759
seizures it's uh it's difficult uh and

535
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:27,240
um the the primary analysis did not show

536
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:31,200
positive was not positive and Counting

537
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:34,880
spasms so Jazz pulled pulled the study

538
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,038
um next we went to uh this myoclonic

539
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,080
atonic seizure study uh which looked get

540
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:43,319
there was a big um focus on cognition

541
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:46,158
Improvement and behavior in the study so

542
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:49,879
was excited um and that was also just

543
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,278
pulled so uh two the two big Jazz

544
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:57,159
studies uh that were robustly designed

545
00:23:52,278 --> 00:24:00,000
as phase three uh will not have

546
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:03,039
data and then then there's the pr willly

547
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,159
syndrome study uh radius and this was

548
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,798
pulled due to change in corporate

549
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,480
priorities um so the study was voluntary

550
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:12,519
termate so again another study we could

551
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,558
have looked forward to answer some

552
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:20,960
questions not there so all kind of

553
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:22,879
sad um and uh you know disappointed but

554
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,240
I I think that there are other studies

555
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,120
coming I saw new studies listed so I

556
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,919
think there is an influx coming this is

557
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,038
kind of the trough you know and there's

558
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,320
a delay and there's some more stuff

559
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:36,759
coming um one that I wanted to talk

560
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,119
about which was is interesting just kind

561
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:42,759
of came out of left field that is

562
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:45,000
positive um was a study on dental pain

563
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,319
acute dental pain I I just I've never

564
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,278
done anything in dentistry I never

565
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,960
thought to look in dental pain and they

566
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,440
looked at epids 10 makes per cake and 20

567
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,399
makes per cake versus placebo 20

568
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,038
patients in each group enough to see

569
00:24:55,398 --> 00:25:00,639
signal um I don't know there's like the

570
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:03,240
some passive aggressive comment at the

571
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,360
front it said GW had no participation in

572
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,359
the design or conduction of this trial

573
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,038
nor did it provide any funding or

574
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,319
material support so that leads me to

575
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,679
believe they might have submitted a

576
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,480
request that got rejected and just did

577
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:21,360
it on their own but uh anyways typical

578
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:24,278
um in points pain uh pain relief bite

579
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:27,240
force and then looking at like psychosis

580
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:31,038
or psychoactive effects and and uh mood

581
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,038
changes and what do we see um pretty

582
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,798
cool

583
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,720
so this is the non-normalized the

584
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:40,440
placebo but you can see a pretty

585
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,679
significant drop in dental pain between

586
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,038
these two group this is Placebo 10 and

587
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,880
20 mix when they

588
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,759
normalize you can see it's pretty clear

589
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
and and I would say not only is this

590
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,319
statistically significant but there is a

591
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:59,000
nice magnitude of effect here like this

592
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:01,038
isn't just like a 10 point 10 per

593
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,119
reduction it's a pretty big reduction

594
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,798
not from Baseline but from Placebo so

595
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,599
I'm I'm pretty happy with these results

596
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,519
um they also looked at bite force which

597
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,359
is much more of an objective outcome and

598
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,558
it's tough to see here in this graph

599
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,918
because you do get variability but when

600
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:21,599
you go over here you clearly see that

601
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,799
this 20 migs per kig is separating from

602
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,558
here in terms of bite force so not only

603
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:27,200
do you have self-reported pain but you

604
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:29,359
actually have the mechanical Act of

605
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,159
saying hey does this hurt when you bite

606
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:34,240
and you can go to a much higher level

607
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,520
because it's not painful so interesting

608
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,240
maybe Dentistry maybe there's needs to

609
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,240
be more more work in the Dentistry

610
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,759
segment so um also need to talk about

611
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:50,240
some of the Adverse Events um we didn't

612
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:52,599
really see any psychoactive changes by

613
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,880
that they mean intoxicating no mood

614
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:59,119
changes uh saw some sedation so um you

615
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,559
know we we've seen that before before um

616
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,719
actually more in the 10 migs than the 20

617
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:05,879
don't know what to make of that diarrhea

618
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,000
it's been reported uh same thing with

619
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,399
the abdominal pain so just be clear it's

620
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,398
not the oil that gives the diarrhea it's

621
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:14,879
something going on with CBD most of this

622
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:17,038
is transient and at least in epilepsy a

623
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,480
lot of the patients were like well these

624
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,480
aeds make me constipated so it's great

625
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,319
that I'm getting more regular so side

626
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,919
effect could be benefit uh in some cases

627
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,798
all right last study I'm going to

628
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,600
mention is an older study this is zerba

629
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:34,558
study this is a topical CBD study it's a

630
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:36,398
little bit older and you may be

631
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,599
wondering why I'm going to I'm going to

632
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:42,719
present this study um first I think that

633
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,439
exposure they never uh provided their PK

634
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,079
for this study so I think exposure to

635
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,600
CBD is fairly low unless they took a

636
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:52,918
shower in the zerbit topical um and in

637
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,959
the first group you didn't really see

638
00:27:52,919 --> 00:28:00,200
much combined no P values but if you

639
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:02,880
look at this this 90% meated group you

640
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,840
do start seeing positive P values this

641
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,559
is social avoidance so for those that

642
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,158
you that don't know fragile X it's like

643
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,839
kind of like a developmental incopy they

644
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:17,080
have uh often have seizures but also

645
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,359
like autistic like behavior um so this

646
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:23,038
is this is a win but it only happened in

647
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,918
this group and again older study um and

648
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,879
this is kind of Brian Thomas's

649
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,278
brainchild so if you know Brian Thomas

650
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,679
he's a legend in the field and uh

651
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,440
usually have to get a whiteboard out

652
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:35,840
when we have conversations because it's

653
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,519
a lot to digest and things make

654
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,678
connections that you don't expect to

655
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:43,839
make connections and as we move on again

656
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:46,840
you see in this group you see you can

657
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,720
see these Trends and again statistical

658
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:51,839
significance and social avoidance and I

659
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,600
think this is a very low exposure CBD I

660
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:58,158
would have love to see what happened

661
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:59,519
with 10 or 20 mi per K uh CBD or with

662
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,679
the combination product that had a

663
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:06,558
little bit of THC in it but again

664
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:09,200
looking positive so why is this why why

665
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,398
are we seeing this fully methylated

666
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,640
group and we could say maybe they're

667
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:16,599
they're more they're the effect they're

668
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,080
they're affected to a greater degree

669
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:22,719
than the other group maybe that's one

670
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:27,278
answer but the other thing it could be

671
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:30,679
is fmr1 leads to the loss of fmrp and

672
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:33,278
overexpression of dag lipac in 2 Ag and

673
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:35,600
when that happens so some people may say

674
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:39,278
that's good but actually what happens is

675
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:41,558
you tend to desensitize cv1 right and

676
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,880
when that happens it's a loss of

677
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:45,720
function so you've by increasing these

678
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,360
indocan ammonoids constantly you've

679
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:53,519
desensitized these these CB1 uh

680
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:55,558
receptors by adding CBD it it Robert

681
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,319
laprairie and Kim Macky have done a lot

682
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:00,558
of work on negative alisic modulation it

683
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,439
may be less is more because what seems

684
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:05,759
to be happening is that seems to

685
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,519
interfere with beta rest and induced

686
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:11,558
internalization so while you may

687
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:14,759
decrease The Binding of THC or the the

688
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:18,558
endoc canabo it may actually increase

689
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:21,759
overall C1 CB1 expression leading to

690
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:23,678
more receptor sites so less maybe more

691
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:27,278
we know that the strong agonists like

692
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,519
spice and K2 not good drugs actually

693
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:32,440
quite toxic

694
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,720
um so we we may actually want a a weaker

695
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,880
binding Agonist and we may want to

696
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,679
retain this CB1 tone and so I I bring

697
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,440
this up because this may be as Ethan has

698
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:45,159
spoke about and we heard with

699
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,440
endometriosis like we actually may want

700
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,840
a weaker Agonist than a stronger Agonist

701
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,759
to Target this area and I am almost done

702
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:57,079
so um I will briefly talk about we've

703
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:59,319
got study just started um I think it's

704
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:02,759
Innovative study that's clearly biased

705
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:05,079
because it's my study um but um it is

706
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,879
mechanisms with high CBD extract this is

707
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:09,439
a Botanical drug

708
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,399
substance um it's in complex regional

709
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,000
pain syndrome um and as you can see

710
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,439
complex regional pain syndrome looks

711
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,480
terrible I don't have to tell you all

712
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,320
the details but usually it happens after

713
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,519
a fracture nothing touches this

714
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,599
condition other than maybe nerve blocks

715
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,960
it's got autoimmune component bone

716
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,719
component it's got a lot of problems not

717
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,919
a lot of things to do

718
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,919
um and they're really s sensitive to

719
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,599
temperature so what we're doing um which

720
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,480
I never really got to do before is we're

721
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:43,719
looking at pain but we're looking at

722
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,399
pain under fmri as well so bold looks at

723
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,679
the oxygen level so if you if you see

724
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,319
healthy individuals versus chronic pain

725
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,200
you see a significant difference so a

726
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,839
very objective outcome and we have

727
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,798
Placebo groups so we'll see what the

728
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,918
changes look like with and without

729
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:01,038
medication we're also doing the St

730
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,519
standard treatment for for 8 weeks and

731
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:06,679
we're looking at things like the

732
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:10,200
standard V scales a brief pain index um

733
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:12,559
we've got depression anxiety trait sleep

734
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,519
promise 29 uh some trough

735
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,519
pharmacokinetics and then a bunch of

736
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,319
biomarkers related to pain and

737
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:22,798
inflammation so uh very excited hope to

738
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:25,158
present the data for these to today but

739
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,119
but I don't have it yet so um and we've

740
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,278
got uh four more of these coming where

741
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,879
we've got a Dand so uh that's what I'll

742
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:34,500
leave us with today and uh thanks so

743
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,080
much for your

744
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,638
[Applause]

745
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:40,119
[Music]

746
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:41,558
time I don't have time for questions but

747
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:45,079
if you guys like to chat afterwards

748
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:45,079
please let me know
