00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,038
we have a lot of conviction that we can

3
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:14,949
find a therapy that not only deals with

4
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:17,050
the symptoms would actually attacks the

5
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:20,710
source of the problem through my own

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:23,830
personal research on cannabis I found

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,750
that there's women in particular have a

8
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,038
high concentration of endocannabinoid

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,778
receptors meaning that they are

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,579
particularly receptive to the medicinal

11
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:35,558
properties of the plant and I've read

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,840
tons of anecdotal data and research

13
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:41,578
published by universities that cannabis

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,859
does help with endometriosis and

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,600
endometriosis is tissue that forms very

16
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:48,190
simply put it's tissue that forms on the

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,448
a delay of the uterus which causes very

18
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,698
painful periods and can cause

19
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:54,039
infertility why is women's health

20
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:55,479
important it's a no-brainer to me we're

21
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,670
more than half the world's population

22
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:59,648
we're your caregivers we're the

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,280
caregivers our children are our spouses

24
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:05,019
of our parents our grandparents if we're

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,909
not going to take care of ourselves then

26
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,930
who will what we as women fail to

27
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:12,580
realize is how much power we truly have

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,000
right now we are undergoing a seismic

29
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:19,539
shift in women's personal and

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,180
professional power by 2020 women in the

31
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:26,020
United States are gonna control 22

32
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,540
trillion in u.s. wealth we don't need

33
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:30,310
anyone we can fund our own research we

34
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,368
can push forward products and science

35
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,259
that actually benefit us we women u.s.

36
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:37,930
women are the biggest consumers on the

37
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:40,030
planet even if you're not working you

38
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,979
decide what goes in the cupboards what

39
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,329
goes in the kitchen when to when and

40
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:45,849
where to make the doctors and dentists

41
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:47,349
appointments we are the caregivers it's

42
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:48,559
time to put our money where our health

43
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:55,449
is
