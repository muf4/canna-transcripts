1
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,719
all right hello everyone

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,039
my name is ben emerald i'm the marketing

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,599
manager at medicinal genomics

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,359
and i'll be your moderator for today

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,839
first thank you for joining us to

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,079
discuss

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,920
the facts and myths around quantitative

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,118
enumeration of yeast and mold on

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,480
cannabis

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,320
there's a lot of confusion and

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,240
misinformation on the topic

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,839
that we hear from customers and our

13
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,678
customers customers

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,840
regulators really everyone so we thought

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,600
the best way to address it would be to

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,120
lay it all out in the webinar

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,719
having said that we're going to cover a

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,839
lot of ground and

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,840
if you're not as familiar with

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,520
microbiology or molecular methods like

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,120
qpcr it may seem like a lot so

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,719
we invite you to submit questions

23
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,359
throughout the presentation

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,840
and we'll do our best here to address

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,479
them

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,480
either in the chat or in the q a session

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,198
following the presentation

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,718
to do that click the q a icon in the

29
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,399
bottom of your screen

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,079
this will open up a chat window you can

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
submit your question

32
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,079
um and if we don't have time to get to

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,680
your question we'll follow up via email

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,359
and of course if you think of a question

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,118
after the webinar you can

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,239
email us at info medicinalgenomics.com

37
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,239
and we can respond to you that way also

38
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,239
this webinar is being recorded

39
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,519
and it will be available on our website

40
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,599
later this week

41
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,280
so if you need to jump off don't worry

42
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,599
we'll email each of you when the

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,599
recording is available

44
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,078
with that i'd like to introduce today's

45
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,000
presenter cso and founder of medicinal

46
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,319
genomics kevin mckernan

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,438
kevin is a pioneer in the genomics of

48
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,118
cannabis and hemp

49
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,879
dedicated to building a stronger

50
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,478
scientific environment

51
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,640
for the study of cannabis-based

52
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,640
therapeutics product safety

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,879
and blockchain technologies for tracking

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,478
and verifying cannabis genetics

55
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,839
so take it away kevin thanks ben

56
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,679
so we're going to cover some ground here

57
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,280
today um i think it's important in doing

58
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,439
so we lay out some conflicts we're

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,718
obviously a manufacturer in the field we

60
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,158
make pcr kits

61
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,239
so you're going to see a pretty pcr

62
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,439
heavy presentation here

63
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,038
i think there's some other conflicts

64
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,439
they're worth also putting on the table

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,878
um

66
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,120
there are certainly many different

67
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,919
business interests in testing cannabis

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,039
we have um

69
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,878
many of the growers who are very

70
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,400
interested in getting reproducible

71
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,159
testing from labs

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,599
uh and they want there to be a fairly

73
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,598
open and free market there so they can

74
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,199
trust any lab and get the same answer

75
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,280
uh there's also been concern that

76
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,598
they're that lab shopping can influence

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
the marketplace and that growers may be

78
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,560
interested perhaps in

79
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,719
lower fail rates so they can get more

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,439
volume through and sometimes those

81
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,840
financial interests may not always be at

82
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,479
uh

83
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,319
in line with the patient interests uh i

84
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,840
think from our experience working a lot

85
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,958
of testing labs they're most interested

86
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,598
in reproducibility

87
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,719
in accuracy and scalability which are

88
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,719
three topics that i think are going to

89
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,080
fit well with the pccr theme that we

90
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,919
speak about today

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
and then there are regulators who are

92
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,878
interested in addressing many of these

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
these conflicts

94
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,679
we all have business motivations and

95
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,439
their interest is to look out for the

96
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,840
patient who may not be reflected in in

97
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,560
some of the conflicts that are here

98
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,000
so with that backdrop uh i want to

99
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,840
encourage everyone who is listing this

100
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,759
to take a real firm look at how the

101
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,439
language of regulation is being written

102
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,518
and some is very different in each

103
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,439
jurisdiction but i think the one

104
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,000
confounding term that is that is

105
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,079
haunting the

106
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
entire field and holding us back is this

107
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,640
reliance on a colony-forming unit

108
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,158
because it's not a very specific term

109
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,000
and it's a term you can drive a truck

110
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,679
through and as a result this is going to

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,680
induce a tremendous amount of lab

112
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,959
shopping and arguments over who's right

113
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,640
and who's wrong

114
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
when i think when you get boil this down

115
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,518
to a dna level a lot of those problems

116
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,080
disappear

117
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,000
and now that i've made um such an

118
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
outrageous statement i should back it up

119
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,479
a little bit with some of her history in

120
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,919
this field

121
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,919
uh and let you know that we're not

122
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,559
quacks uh we've actually been doing a

123
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,759
lot of dna sequencing and managing of e

124
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,598
coli

125
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,598
and bacteria cultures for a very long

126
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,479
time i've been in the field for over 25

127
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,438
years

128
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,119
and i helped eric lander construct this

129
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,479
sequencing pipeline in the human genome

130
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,920
project i managed his research and

131
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,598
development group there and we built

132
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,079
this pipeline to manage

133
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,119
and culture 10 or 20 million different e

134
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,360
coli cultures

135
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,599
in 10 months and this was used to

136
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,200
sequence the dna out of those e-coli and

137
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,039
do it quite effectively

138
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,399
so we can we became very aware of how to

139
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,319
quantitate uh

140
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,000
these these organisms how to lyse open

141
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,599
these organisms and how to read dna out

142
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
of these organisms in a manner which is

143
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,199
very reflective of their

144
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,000
reproductive capacity a lot of this

145
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
technology

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,519
was then distilled into a startup

147
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,240
company called agincourt biosciences

148
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,079
which

149
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
became the largest commercial sequencing

150
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,839
vendor in the world back in 2000 to

151
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,720
2005.

152
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,399
we also developed these dna purification

153
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
tools which you're seeing at this

154
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,679
lower picture of these beads down in the

155
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
lower right hand corner of the slide

156
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,639
this is one of the more popular dna

157
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,319
purification systems now in the

158
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,000
marketplace i've seen reports that

159
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,360
suggest this up to 80

160
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,720
of the market of next generation

161
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,919
sequencing is running off of something

162
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,600
known as ampure

163
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,599
which is a dna purification system that

164
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
we developed there at agincourt

165
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,360
uh beckman coulter acquired that company

166
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,279
they didn't know what to do with one of

167
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
our skunk work projects so they

168
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,638
decided to spin that out and fund it

169
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,079
with six million dollars we had another

170
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,240
six million from nhgri

171
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,079
and we built the dna sequencer that is

172
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
showcased here on science the cover of

173
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,079
science translational medicine

174
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
this is a solid sequencer abi came to

175
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,439
acquire that technology

176
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,520
uh they ended up commercializing it and

177
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,639
capturing 35 percent of the market share

178
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,319
by 2008 next to aluminum and this was

179
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,918
uh the company was eventually acquired

180
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,959
by life technologies

181
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,478
uh largely um justified

182
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,879
on incorporating the uh the solid

183
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,879
sequencer into liftex portfolio

184
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,600
this system utilized massively parallel

185
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,240
pcr of single molecules so you had to be

186
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,120
very cautious when amplifying single

187
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,720
molecules

188
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,360
billions and billions of times such that

189
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,639
your primers didn't misreact

190
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
and that's actually going to play a role

191
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,160
in some of the story we speak about

192
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,160
today

193
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,199
after this this system was getting

194
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,800
utilized

195
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,478
for cancer patients they were sequencing

196
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
tumors trying to find the druggable

197
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,359
mutations in those tumors

198
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
the only challenge is we didn't have

199
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,120
very non-toxic drugs at the time

200
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
so i got very interested in cannabis

201
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,439
because this is a plant that made

202
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,519
a tremendous number of compounds that

203
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,319
look they're showing promise in

204
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,000
in cancer and they're very non-toxic so

205
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,160
we sequenced the first cannabis genome

206
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,079
back in 2011 and put a public

207
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,840
john page followed up on this actually

208
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,680
uh referenced some of this work and did

209
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,359
a much more thorough job and published a

210
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,959
lot of rna sequencing and multiple

211
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
genomes at the same time

212
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,799
uh that that work came public shortly

213
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,280
after uh and uh has

214
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,038
been a a real boon to the entire field

215
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,918
now that we have multiple genomes that

216
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,079
are done

217
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,959
uh we can predict what we can do with

218
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,839
pcr

219
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,279
in in a cannabis background uh so over

220
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,239
the course of these years i've luckily

221
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,638
run into over

222
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,519
uh you know 41 000 citations in the work

223
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
that we've done

224
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,598
uh the work that i was mentored by by

225
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,519
eric lander he's now the scientific

226
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,759
advisor for for president biden

227
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,799
uh uh his citations are tenfold higher

228
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,038
one of the most

229
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,079
highly cited scientists in the world so

230
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,839
we have a good understanding

231
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,279
of what's going on when it comes to pcr

232
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,839
but one thing

233
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,918
that was really strong in dr lander's uh

234
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,000
motivation was keeping data as

235
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,918
public as possible because it floats

236
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,079
many more boats

237
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,038
and it really helps buoy the entire

238
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,959
marketplace

239
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,240
uh we've been doing that with cannabis

240
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,478
we have sequenced um

241
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,918
the largest set of cannabis dna sequence

242
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:24,959
that's out there in the world is public

243
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,918
under our name

244
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,198
uh we've been uh actively putting these

245
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,000
genomes public so that there's a

246
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,598
resource for other

247
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
people to build tools and so the market

248
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,360
grows faster than we can

249
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,439
simply harvest these gms ourselves we've

250
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
also put some very relevant publications

251
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,000
forward

252
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,439
peer-reviewed that are relevant to this

253
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,120
very conversation

254
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,439
the first cannabis microbiomes were

255
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,639
sequenced by us back in 2016.

256
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,079
uh we've also discovered a couple nasty

257
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,680
microbes that grow some really

258
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,598
interesting mycotoxins that can be found

259
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,598
on cannabis in these publications

260
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,598
and we also put public our primers for

261
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,439
doing this back in 2016.

262
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,439
this is a really important point because

263
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,360
we stumbled on this for a few years

264
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,879
when we were trying to get pcr to behave

265
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
in cannabis and

266
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,879
and distinguish yeast and molds from

267
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,560
cannabis and when we didn't have a

268
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,240
cannabis reference genome we were making

269
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,319
all types of mistakes we were the

270
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,000
primers kept reacting on cannabis

271
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,280
and we couldn't distinguish fungi from

272
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,079
cannabis we solved that problem back in

273
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,758
2016 and i want to

274
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,279
demonstrate what that uh what that can

275
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,800
do for the field

276
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,679
in addition to our experience in human

277
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,079
genomics we've put a lot of

278
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
fungal genomes public and the reason i'm

279
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,838
emphasizing this is many of these

280
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,918
genomes at least 57 of them we have

281
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
sequenced without using culture

282
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,679
we just were able to get genome

283
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,120
sequencing off of spores alone

284
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,319
this is something that can be done now

285
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,918
and i think it's a really important

286
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,920
thing to underscore because we do have

287
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,919
some regulators in this field

288
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,439
that want to move the entire industry

289
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,879
back to plating

290
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,640
because they believe that's the only way

291
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,000
you can get dna sequencing and that's

292
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,759
just outdated information

293
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
uh you will know also notice this in the

294
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,120
sars epidemic you can get sequencing off

295
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,360
of viruses that that

296
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,399
uh without even culturing them uh so

297
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,839
we're committed to putting a lot of

298
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,440
these genomes public and and

299
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,640
particularly uh we have been putting

300
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,240
genomes public

301
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,240
many of which are picked off of this the

302
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,919
backdrop here that are that are fungal

303
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,399
genomes that exist on cannabis so we get

304
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,719
a better understanding of the microbiome

305
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,600
uh and we have a better repertoire of uh

306
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
of what

307
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,200
you know what databases we need to

308
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,278
navigate this problem

309
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,440
okay so the outline of talk today uh now

310
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,799
we have that um that backdrop

311
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
uh there's a couple drawbacks of both

312
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,519
platforms and we should be honest about

313
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
them there are drawbacks of culture and

314
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,919
that the vast majority of microbes are

315
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,600
not culturable

316
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,958
uh this makes it very difficult to have

317
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,639
a total yeast and mold test

318
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,039
because the vast majority of your yeast

319
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,199
and mold in fact won't culture

320
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,519
there is poor selectivity with culture

321
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,600
and that the conditions you need to grow

322
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,039
yeast and mold often grow bacteria and

323
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,639
if you ever want to use antibiotics to

324
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,480
get rid of the bacteria you're often

325
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,838
inhibiting the mold uh we'll show you

326
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
some data on that and a few slides

327
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,800
forward

328
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,240
plating is highly variable it's more so

329
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,359
variable in yeast and mold than it is on

330
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,639
bacteria

331
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
and we'll show you why that has to do

332
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,879
with the fact that the mold tends to be

333
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,719
endophytic in cannabis it grows inside

334
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,278
the plant and is vascularized in the

335
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,879
plant

336
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,799
and you can't get that out of the plant

337
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,639
without lysine open cell walls

338
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,719
and fungi have cell walls and cell

339
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,679
membranes so you're typically lysing

340
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,959
open both

341
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,958
when you want to get access to the

342
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,799
endophytes fungi also have unique

343
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,958
biological anatomy they have canadian uh

344
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,799
we call these things spore grenades uh

345
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,278
they have a host of maybe a hundred or a

346
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,519
thousand spores on the end of a

347
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,278
biological feature that you can easily

348
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,278
pipet up in one go

349
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,200
and get very stochastic answers you know

350
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,078
thousands of cfus in one playing and

351
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
when you do it again

352
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,679
off the same matrix you end up with

353
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,360
nothing uh this is what is known as

354
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,919
heterogeneous macro colonies

355
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,879
in the filamentous fungi world there are

356
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,958
also inhibitors

357
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,078
that influence culture when you are

358
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,919
putting matrix

359
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,399
uh into a culture system you are not

360
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,719
purifying any dna out of that system you

361
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,240
are

362
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,320
you are putting that onto a plate with

363
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,680
all of the inhibitors present

364
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,519
and this is a very serious issue with

365
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,278
cannabis because cannabis is 20

366
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,039
by weight made of antibiotics it's made

367
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,039
of cannabinoids and made of terpenes

368
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,278
and those antibiotics very tremendously

369
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,519
strained to strain you can have 100 thc

370
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,559
lines things that i shouldn't say 100

371
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,639
but 20 c

372
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,719
thc lines with a small fraction of maybe

373
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,480
a 20 to 1 cbd ratio

374
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,079
you can have cbd dominant lines you can

375
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,759
have cvg dominant lines you can have

376
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,120
cannabinoid null lines there's there's a

377
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,559
whole variety of different cannabinoids

378
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
that can be expressed and the terpene

379
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,919
profiles are just as complicated and

380
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
those are known to play a role in as

381
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,399
as antibiotics so on the flip side of

382
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,360
this we have some drawbacks to pcr one

383
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,879
of the things that's brought up quite a

384
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,399
bit is we're too sensitive

385
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,320
we can pick up single molecules and

386
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,600
that's just going to fail everything

387
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
we don't see that in practice and we'll

388
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,240
touch on as to why we believe that is

389
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,759
there are its and 16s targets that we

390
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,120
utilize for the total test the total

391
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,120
aerobic test and total

392
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,799
yeast and mold tests these can have

393
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,639
variable copy number and genomes

394
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,159
uh this is actually we believe the

395
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,240
benefit not occurs uh

396
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,519
and we'll explain that in a few slides

397
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,959
forward but um

398
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,600
in put shortly you would rather have

399
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,958
more than one copy of a target in genome

400
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
than something that doesn't culture at

401
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,439
all

402
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,800
dealing with a zero or one problem is

403
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
really difficult dealing with a one or

404
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,559
ten problem is very easy

405
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
uh live versus dead needs to be

406
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,919
considered when you're dealing with pcr

407
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,439
because you're amplifying dna and it

408
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,000
doesn't matter whether it's inside or

409
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
outside

410
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,240
of the organism so there are ways that

411
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,078
in techniques that you can use to enrich

412
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,159
uh for things that are live you can

413
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,319
perform enrichment that's one way

414
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,759
you can centrifuge things which pellets

415
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,839
the cells and leaves the free-floating

416
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,480
dna in solution or you can use nucleases

417
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,720
and we have been

418
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,000
employing a variety of those techniques

419
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,240
uh in the methods

420
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,240
uh one thing that is uh really critical

421
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,278
moving from bacteria to fungi is you

422
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,720
really need to understand your cell

423
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,399
lysis and this is something we argue we

424
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,920
didn't fully appreciate in the last few

425
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,720
years and have recently modified our

426
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,879
protocols

427
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,320
to address there were some standards

428
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,838
brought to market from organisms that

429
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,560
we've never found on cannabis

430
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
canada in particular that are very

431
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,679
difficult to lice

432
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
and we had an engineer a new lysis

433
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,759
reagents to actually tackle those

434
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,519
um again that was an off uh off target

435
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,439
item for us because we had not seen that

436
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,360
organism in cannabis microbiome studies

437
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
nevertheless it was a it is a standard

438
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
that's been evolving in the field

439
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,320
and so we've had a modified protocol so

440
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
we can appropriately lice those things

441
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,600
and

442
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,959
be concordant with them so where is the

443
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,120
puck going in this world

444
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,119
um well if eventually this will be

445
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,720
federally legalized here in the states

446
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
so when we look at what the federal

447
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,920
agencies are doing they're moving toward

448
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,200
genomic methods there's a genome tracker

449
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,439
method down at you at the

450
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,519
at the fda this is something that's

451
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,959
doing genomic surveillance on the food

452
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,159
chain and they're doing this primarily

453
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,159
because they recognize

454
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,919
the vast majority of microbes and risks

455
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,039
to human health are not cultural and

456
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,000
we're never going to pick them up with

457
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,199
the older methods

458
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,958
the other reason they're doing this is

459
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,560
it's faster if we had to culture

460
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,039
everything for the sars coronavirus

461
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,879
problem

462
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,159
we'd be in much deeper trouble than we

463
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,078
are today because the

464
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,958
culturing just takes too long the same

465
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,479
thing as being a voiced down at the cc

466
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,799
as well with the pulse net network where

467
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,639
they're using dna sequencing to capture

468
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,078
uh a snapshot of what's going on in the

469
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,919
food chain uh

470
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:01,278
this was also reiterated by frankie

471
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:03,278
iannis at the 2019 aoec conference where

472
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,399
he underscored the need for genomic

473
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,639
surveillance and the need for

474
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,000
blockchains to track these things

475
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,000
so we believe this is where things are

476
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
going and we believe it

477
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,278
speaks in the direction of molecular

478
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,198
methods

479
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,720
so i'm sure everyone's tired of hearing

480
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,319
about coronavirus but

481
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,160
we do need to take a look at this story

482
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
what did we use for chronovirus

483
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,360
we did not culture things we did

484
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,160
initially

485
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,680
in that the jafar paper here rita did a

486
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,879
great job demonstrating

487
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,399
what ct values correlated with the pfus

488
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,919
these are platforming units as opposed

489
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,759
to commonly forming units

490
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,599
but once they had that calibration done

491
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,679
they never went back they threw it out

492
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,440
and the main reason for throwing it out

493
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,759
is culturing human pathogens

494
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,600
is dangerous and if you don't if you

495
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,198
think the laboratory regulations are

496
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,720
tight now they're about to get tighter

497
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,479
uh we've all seen the news about what's

498
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,720
going on with the potential lab leak

499
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,920
out of wuhan uh that is going to lead to

500
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,800
a much more stringent laboratory

501
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,000
environments

502
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,039
uh they are not going to want you

503
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,440
replicating human pathogens in your lab

504
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,439
simply to measure a small amount of them

505
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,199
if your assay requires making billions

506
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,079
of copies of a pathogen to measure a

507
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,359
single one of them

508
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,120
they're going to be pushing you toward

509
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,519
pcr because you can replicate these

510
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,799
things

511
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,278
measure them without them being

512
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,639
infectious using genomics

513
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,480
so i'll reiterate over a billion of

514
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,440
these pcr assays were done in the last

515
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,720
year

516
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,639
without any culture and they were still

517
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,160
able to sequence millions of these

518
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,639
genomes without having to culture a

519
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,240
single one of them now another one of

520
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,600
the reasons why they did this was quite

521
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,759
evident in the harcourt paper

522
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,600
the harcart paper demonstrated that the

523
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,399
cell line in the culturing conditions

524
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,440
that you use

525
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,399
can drastically vary

526
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
uh the pfu count so if you were working

527
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,919
with 293

528
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,360
t cells you had log scale lower results

529
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,838
than if you were with various cells

530
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,959
um there was in some cases you can see

531
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,959
there are almost

532
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,479
10 000 full differences based on the

533
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,559
culturing conditions that you use

534
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,240
to get your pfeu counts so once they had

535
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,879
this calibrated on virus cells they

536
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
moved on

537
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,720
and uh and went with molecular methods

538
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,160
all the way

539
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,839
so we think this is going to find its

540
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,198
way into our life in the future we don't

541
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,560
know exactly when federal

542
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,319
legalization is going to happen here in

543
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,159
the united states but we certainly think

544
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,680
even before that occurs there is going

545
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,600
to be more scrutiny applied

546
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,879
uh to labs that are managing pathogenic

547
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,480
microbes

548
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,320
and and it's going to push the world in

549
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,600
a direction of using more molecular base

550
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,879
methods as opposed to

551
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,040
traditional methods that require

552
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,360
replicating the pathogen to count it

553
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,039
um so this brings us to a common uh

554
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,600
critique here is that plating is a gold

555
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,759
standard

556
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,440
um and that may have been true 50 years

557
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,399
ago it's been used for probably 100

558
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
years now

559
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,720
but the reality is it was developed in a

560
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
time frame when we didn't really

561
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,639
understand what we were counting uh

562
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,879
people

563
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,560
began plating things before we even knew

564
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,159
what dna was

565
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,679
so we're at a stage now where we can

566
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,958
count these things more accurately and

567
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,638
some of the terminology that we've been

568
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,039
using in the past needs to be

569
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,000
modernized with what we can do today so

570
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,159
we did do a study

571
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,519
in michigan and michigan was um

572
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,319
concerned that they were missing

573
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,600
pathogens

574
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,440
using pcr so they set up an erv with aoc

575
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
we ran a large study only to find out

576
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,919
that pcr was finding

577
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,678
more microbes than plating was we've

578
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,319
then put together all of this work and

579
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,038
published this

580
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,359
it's still in peer review but this was

581
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:13,038
uh

582
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,639
effectively sequencing every whole

583
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,679
genome of every single colony that was

584
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,319
in the study

585
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,199
to figure out what was going on i'm

586
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:20,639
going to walk you through some of the

587
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,880
design of this study

588
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,120
uh it started with cannabis flowers that

589
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,280
were homogenized by a third-party lab

590
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,558
large quantities of it and they

591
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,119
segregated the this

592
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,319
uh and bend the cannabis into into three

593
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,558
buckets that were measured

594
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,319
using culture and chlorophenicol so

595
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,399
they've came up with

596
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,918
bins of cannabis that were high medium

597
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,720
and low cfu counts

598
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,320
as measured on uh on something using

599
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,240
chloramphenicol which is a selective

600
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,918
agent to knock down bacteria but we also

601
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,279
know it knocks down aspergillus and

602
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,038
other fungi

603
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,720
these samples once they were partitioned

604
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,839
were sent out to fourth party labs that

605
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,400
would then run

606
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,119
uh some of these experiments on 10 gram

607
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,160
samples

608
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,839
in in replica five five time replication

609
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,759
uh so during this study one interesting

610
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,439
thing emerged is that we looked at

611
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,679
what the three different culture mediums

612
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,960
did because the many of the bam

613
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,798
um chapters give you some latitude here

614
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,240
you can use pda or drbc you're not

615
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:15,599
you're not locked in on one culture

616
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,679
system one antibiotic and

617
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,199
and one growth time you have latitude

618
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,759
there and that latitude we want to see

619
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,919
how

620
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,599
what is it what does it produce we we

621
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,559
actually had trained our qpcr system on

622
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,959
pda

623
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,319
uh and so we were used to the

624
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,880
correlation there

625
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,720
in came drbc which has more selection

626
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,160
than pda and we got different numbers

627
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
um so this is what some of the

628
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
experiment looked like by the time it

629
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,160
reached us of course the colonies got

630
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
larger than we liked for sequencing but

631
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,200
fortunately the people who

632
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,038
who counted these colonies in the labs

633
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
in michigan pinpointed them with markers

634
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,879
so we could tell where to pick

635
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,640
we picked those colonies uh and began

636
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,880
sequencing those

637
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,000
uh and right out of the gate one thing

638
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,080
you'll notice

639
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,679
uh is that there is a log scale

640
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,439
difference in cfus that we're seeing

641
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,038
between the different culture mediums so

642
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,960
there's a ten-fold increase in the

643
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,640
number of cfus found when you move from

644
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,120
drbc with chlorofenical

645
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,520
to pda with chlorine fenecol and another

646
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,038
tenfold

647
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,558
increase when you used to go to pda

648
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,919
without any chlorine veticle so here we

649
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,119
have a hundred fold variance and what a

650
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,520
cfu might be

651
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,798
so if a regulation just says cfu we

652
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,160
don't really know what that means and

653
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,279
we're never getting molecular methods to

654
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,200
really zero in on this

655
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,319
all right we really have to get the

656
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
specifications down

657
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,599
down pat and also debate which is the

658
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,519
right specification because

659
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,599
uh for patient safety they're not going

660
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,879
to like the rbc uh maybe the growers

661
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,119
will like this because

662
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,480
it will pass the most amount of cannabis

663
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,000
but as we'll show you

664
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,519
some of the most dangerous pathogens are

665
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,720
the ones that are getting omitted while

666
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:42,480
using this

667
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,160
so we took aspergillus which is the only

668
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,319
thing to really kill people in cannabis

669
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,679
we took many flavors of them from atcc

670
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,918
and started plating them

671
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,519
as monocultures no matrix background

672
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,280
interfering with this just to see

673
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,558
do we pick them up with pcr do we pick

674
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,480
them up with pda

675
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,079
and do we pick them up with drbc the

676
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,759
vast majority of them did not grow in

677
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,038
five days on pda we had to push them out

678
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,319
to seven days to get some of the

679
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,279
colonies to emerge

680
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,079
we picked up most of them with pcr we

681
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,678
have some ct

682
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,079
some weak cts and rhizopus that we're

683
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,880
trying to address uh pda picked them all

684
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,558
up

685
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,640
the other thing that we noticed in the

686
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,558
erv study that we did in michigan

687
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,159
was that the standard deviations for

688
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,918
plating were all over the map

689
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,120
this makes it very hard to tune

690
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,400
something that has better standard

691
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,319
deviations than plating

692
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
against it we're now benchmarking this

693
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,158
and being asked to break pcr to make it

694
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,240
as bad as drbc

695
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,480
um this is a real step backwards in our

696
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,798
opinion for patient safety

697
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,839
um so here's the example of 5x replica

698
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:37,359
plating from the study

699
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,279
where you can see the standard

700
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,399
deviations for plating are all over the

701
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,079
place sometimes

702
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,038
42 percent variance on the actual count

703
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,879
and as you know from the prior slide um

704
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,400
there was

705
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,880
many fewer colonies being counted on

706
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,960
drbc so pcr overestimates

707
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,960
and tends to fail more now

708
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,720
the the standard deviations on the pcr

709
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,919
side are actually much tighter so this

710
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,079
is something that i think labs

711
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,759
appreciate they want to see high rep

712
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,359
highly reproducible results that are

713
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,960
accurate and that can be turned around

714
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,879
very quickly plating is the opposite of

715
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,960
all those three things

716
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,720
now interestingly enough the state looks

717
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,400
like it's moving forward on drbc

718
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,558
despite their initial public concerns

719
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,240
the pcr was missing things

720
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,158
this concern was raised by one

721
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,000
laboratory in the state

722
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,559
that perjured themselves to the state

723
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,919
claiming that our test was not picking

724
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,759
these things up when they never had

725
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,840
purchased our complete kits

726
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,079
so this whole mess in michigan started

727
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,599
off of a lab complaining to the state

728
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,519
with fabricated data

729
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,798
and now they've moved to drbc which is

730
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,038
likely going to put patients

731
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,639
at risk because of this problem here we

732
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,640
have aspergillus that is

733
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,679
a public literature showing that

734
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,960
aspergillus

735
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:51,120
is hindered by things like the rbc

736
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,480
uh the the corn the chlorine phenocal

737
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,879
antibiotics that are present on this

738
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,720
thing

739
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,880
reduce the growth of this we have got

740
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,640
evidence of it in in our pcr data and

741
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,120
sequencing as well

742
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,720
and this is getting pushed upon all the

743
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,839
labs in michigan to

744
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,759
uproot all the gear that they've

745
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,959
purchased in the past put in new gear

746
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,679
switch to something that's less

747
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,279
sensitive

748
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,640
all under the banner of patient safety

749
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,319
when it's actually going to be worse

750
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,000
so we've also heard this that plating

751
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,038
results you know the plating results

752
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,880
actually represent the

753
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,000
the microbial population on a sample

754
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
because you're only looking for things

755
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,279
that are viable well this isn't really

756
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,480
true if there's really strong selective

757
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,079
pressure applied

758
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,839
it's only going to culture the organisms

759
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,599
that can culture and then the moment you

760
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,038
put selective pressure on there

761
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,558
you end up with something different so

762
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,759
let's go through all the whole genome

763
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,519
sequencing that we did

764
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,879
i'm not going to the paper has all 45

765
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,079
gm's there i've just picked a few of

766
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,280
them here to give you a taste of what's

767
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,879
going on

768
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,359
you can tell these ones are on drbc

769
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,640
based on the pink backdrop of the colony

770
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,719
but what you're looking at up here in

771
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,120
the upper left is the coverage map

772
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,880
of these genomes you want to see a

773
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,959
fairly horizontal line there that shows

774
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,400
you there is coverage

775
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,480
in this case it's about 80-fold

776
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,400
sequencing coverage on all the context

777
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,480
the contexts are sorted in size from

778
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,080
from the longest contigs on the left to

779
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,839
the shortest contacts on the right so we

780
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,918
get about 2 000 contents out of these

781
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,639
assemblies from illumina

782
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,320
and when we see multiple horizontal

783
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,280
lines that tells us we have colonies on

784
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,839
top of colonies or endofungal bacteria

785
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,200
but you can see even in this first batch

786
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,639
of samples with drbc

787
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
we're picking up some pseudomonas on

788
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
here so there is bacteria that's in fact

789
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,759
growing

790
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,519
on this uh in this setting and

791
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,720
contributing to the colony count which

792
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,720
is not fungi

793
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,360
uh these pie charts on the right are how

794
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,880
pure the sequencing is in terms of the

795
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,399
species that they're picking up when

796
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,679
this when this pie chart becomes a

797
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,038
little bit more fractured like you see

798
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,559
in this slide over here you know that

799
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:39,359
you've got a meta genome not a single

800
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:40,639
genome

801
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,079
and you start to see you start to see

802
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,880
that in some of the coverage plots you

803
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,399
see these

804
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,840
other contexts that are really high or

805
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
low coverage that aren't fitting to the

806
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,158
mean

807
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,759
that's a sign that there's more than one

808
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,760
organism there

809
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,158
whereas these two are very clearly fungi

810
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,000
this one here is probably a mix

811
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,679
and we believe that's probably evident

812
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,759
by looking at the size of the genome

813
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,880
that assembled

814
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,400
and and of course it does bring back

815
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,159
memories of other projects we've done in

816
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,120
the past where there have been cases of

817
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,360
ralstonia

818
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,599
on cannabis ralstonia is a known

819
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,599
endofungal bacteria it grows inside of

820
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,599
fungi a very high copy number you can

821
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,399
see here in all these green dots

822
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,079
this is something that's really

823
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,759
difficult to resolve with plating

824
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,038
because it may not necessarily rear its

825
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,640
head on the tack plate and if it's

826
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:23,119
inside the fungi you're really not going

827
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
to

828
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,798
know what's going on inside the fungi

829
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,278
you might get a colony you might get

830
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,879
um well it'll it'll confuse colony

831
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,919
counts and create discordance between

832
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,278
pcr methods and plating methods

833
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,880
all right so that's one that's one

834
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,960
artifact that um you've got to pay

835
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,880
attention to when we move on to pda

836
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,079
as you remember from the previous slide

837
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,400
up there we had tenfold

838
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,519
more colonies with pda and chlorine then

839
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,840
a

840
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,639
but we end up with about a 50 50 mix of

841
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,678
bacteria and

842
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,559
fungi so if you if you do the math there

843
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,720
that means there's about

844
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,678
5x more fungi in pda than there is on

845
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
drbc

846
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,640
but there's also bacteria you have to

847
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,640
sift through so this makes counting

848
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,159
colonies a little bit more tricky

849
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,919
that's a colony counting problem not a

850
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,278
pcr problem though

851
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,880
so some of these colonies are clearly

852
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,919
fungi based on their looks but right

853
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,320
next to them you can see

854
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,080
some uh some bacteria that are growing

855
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,359
another colony there that's fungi

856
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,558
here you get to some colonies it looks

857
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,079
like they're merged or they're colonies

858
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,519
on top of colonies and so these pie

859
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,720
charts widen out and you can see the

860
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,798
coverage charts end up giving you

861
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,120
multiple different horizontal lines here

862
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,918
uh but this is a from a sequencing

863
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,759
standpoint

864
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,840
we can still ascertain the diversity

865
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,919
here because these microbiomes all

866
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,519
assemble into this discrete context and

867
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,320
we can still classify

868
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,440
a multi-colony event is a problem for

869
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,038
counting colonies by

870
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,558
eye it's not a problem for sequencing

871
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,879
genomes we can discern

872
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,240
uh exactly what's going on by sequencing

873
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,120
everything that's present

874
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,319
um this is pda with no chlorine phenical

875
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,719
and in this case

876
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,480
the the the ratio starts to shift for

877
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,079
the predominant number of species here

878
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,278
are in fact bacteria because there's no

879
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,038
antibiotic selection

880
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,798
there's still fungi coming through and

881
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,000
occasionally those fungi have bacteria

882
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,000
underneath them

883
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and it makes for some messy counting

884
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,880
summary of all the 45 colonies that were

885
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,558
shotgun sequenced is listed here uh when

886
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,159
you break them down to the species level

887
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:09,440
uh you can see get some resolution here

888
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,640
and the different types of penicillium

889
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,278
that are there this one that we

890
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,038
published in 2016 is quite prevalent

891
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,640
uh zamir puja often sees this up in

892
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:17,919
canada as well this is uh

893
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,360
this is probably something that should

894
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
be on the target list for things we

895
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,798
should

896
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,839
we should be um uh targeting and testing

897
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:25,839
because it's in fact made

898
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,000
bacteria pull through pda with corn

899
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,599
pentacle is about a 50 50 balance of

900
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,278
both and pda without it

901
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,719
seems to bend the ratio in the other

902
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:39,759
direction more toward bacteria than for

903
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,200
fungi

904
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,038
and of course if you remember there

905
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,038
being tenfold differences in the number

906
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,798
of colonies between each of these

907
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,679
you can ascertain that about there's 5x

908
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,519
less fungi showing up on drbdc

909
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,200
so this is not a total use in mold test

910
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,558
by any means this is a partial yeast and

911
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,240
mold test

912
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,079
that's being adopted probably because

913
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,480
it's easier to count colonies by eye

914
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,399
it's

915
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,159
it's a human anthropomorphism if you

916
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,120
will we don't like counting colonies

917
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,720
visually

918
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,639
when they blend together and drbc does a

919
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,720
better job making them more distinct

920
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,320
another way of monitoring this problem

921
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,839
is to put all the dna sequences through

922
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,480
a simpsons diversity test this is

923
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,720
something that

924
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,480
monitors what is the diversity of the

925
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,839
organisms coming through in a particular

926
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,079
pool of data

927
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,119
and of course it comes up with um the

928
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,639
most diversity

929
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,038
coming out of pa versus um drbc with

930
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,399
corn

931
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:27,839
final claw we'll have to send you an

932
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,038
updated version of this slide that's not

933
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,759
cutting off these um

934
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,440
these these axis here but this is pda

935
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,960
with cornfenecol

936
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,798
this is pda alone and this is drbc

937
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,319
but the systems and diversity index are

938
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,599
most diverse on the pda pool

939
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,439
now the other way to look at this is to

940
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,278
take organisms and plate them without

941
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,278
any matrix background

942
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,720
in confusing things and you plate them

943
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,798
in this case we did on pda

944
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,240
and pda with toteric acid just to get

945
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,119
chlorophenical out of the picture to see

946
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,558
what was happening

947
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,479
we get very similar results when there

948
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,038
aren't bacteria obscuring things

949
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,319
this is just a pure monoculture same

950
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,158
results between these two

951
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,158
plates but a massive drop off with the

952
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,840
rbc uh similar

953
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,360
if you take aspergillus niger and put it

954
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,959
onto chlorine fenical and no chlorine

955
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,398
final call pdr plates we get similar

956
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,278
counts but a massive drop off when we go

957
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:14,959
to drbc

958
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,440
if you take petrito scenario probably

959
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,798
the most commonly found mold on cannabis

960
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,200
well not necessarily considered a very

961
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:24,398
harmful human pathogen it is an allergen

962
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,519
uh this thing has massive growth on pda

963
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,678
almost none on prvc so yes if you want

964
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,960
to pass more cannabis use drbc

965
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,038
the patients won't be happy but the

966
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,880
growers will love it

967
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,079
now there's some other issues on using

968
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,480
plating which is

969
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,439
endophytes canadia and inhibitors all

970
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,720
play a role

971
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,720
disproportionately in plating when they

972
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,759
do over molecular methods what do i mean

973
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,839
by that well

974
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,278
this is aspergillus flavus all right the

975
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,119
top of there is a canadian that's a

976
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,679
sport what we call a spore grenade

977
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,119
uh you can pipet one of those things and

978
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,960
if you break it up in the pipetting

979
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,398
process it will turn into a hundred to a

980
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,840
thousand different colonies

981
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,439
if you don't break it up in a pipetting

982
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,439
process it will turn into one

983
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,679
uh so this is what's known as this

984
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,679
heterogeneous macro colony problem

985
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,919
and it means sample homogenization needs

986
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,200
to be extreme so extreme that we would

987
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,320
argue you should just slice everything

988
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,440
open and measure the dna

989
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,599
because if you don't do this you're

990
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,480
going to get very stochastic sampling

991
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,480
what you see here this is taking sample

992
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,120
from the same homogenized cannabis

993
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,440
flower

994
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,879
and plating it in a replica many times

995
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,880
and what you find

996
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,320
is eventually you get you know one or

997
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,240
two colonies one or two colonies one or

998
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,398
two colonies bang you get a canadian

999
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,399
you get a grenade all right this is why

1000
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,918
there's very high variability in plating

1001
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,439
philanthus fungi

1002
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,360
and if you just do a single plating

1003
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,519
experiment you're really

1004
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,839
setting yourself up for lots of lab to

1005
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,278
lab discordance and lots of arguments

1006
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,798
uh when you delete this further it all

1007
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:45,759
goes away that's all you're seeing there

1008
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:47,679
on the right

1009
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,519
we did document this before and this is

1010
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,360
present one of our pre-prints uh

1011
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,558
where we did this with aspergillus and

1012
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,000
aspergillus

1013
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,599
spores can clump like this and give you

1014
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,880
these heterogeneous macro colonies as

1015
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,719
you go through a dilution

1016
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,399
on different plating systems and it

1017
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,839
gives you very digital results because

1018
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,759
if you don't fully treat these things

1019
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,000
with soaps and heavily homogenize them

1020
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,240
and lice them effectively

1021
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,759
you can't really quantitate these things

1022
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,278
unless you you can figure out how to

1023
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,798
deal with declumping them

1024
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,240
now let's turn to inhibitors many people

1025
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:15,359
will say oh there are polymerase

1026
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,200
inhibitors out there

1027
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,798
uh what they and that may be true if

1028
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,159
you're doing a simple boil prep if you

1029
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,319
take this sampling

1030
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,440
and just simply boil it and then put

1031
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,278
that into pcr

1032
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,558
you are exposed to the polymerase

1033
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,398
inhibitors that might be there from the

1034
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,519
terpenes to the cannabinoids who knows

1035
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,798
there's a lot of things there that could

1036
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,558
potentially inhibit

1037
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,158
polymerases if you're performing in dna

1038
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:34,879
isolation like we are performing in our

1039
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,159
methods

1040
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,919
all of that stuff gets an ethanol

1041
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,159
extraction and gets washed away and you

1042
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,480
end up with highly purified dna

1043
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,600
that doesn't present any inhibitors

1044
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,399
however this is very different in the

1045
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,398
plating environment

1046
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,759
in the plating environment you have to

1047
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,000
live with the fact that those

1048
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,679
inhibitors could be antibiotics and in

1049
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
fact in cannabis they are

1050
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,038
they're very potent antibiotics this is

1051
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,640
a very interesting paper that came out

1052
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,398
recently about another plant that

1053
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,919
synthesizes cannabinoids this is kind of

1054
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,439
new to people in the field

1055
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,640
it's called trauma orientalis

1056
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,919
interesting enough it doesn't produce a

1057
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,600
lot of cannabinoids it produces

1058
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,519
something on the order of 30 to 100

1059
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,798
micrograms per ml so maybe 100 or a

1060
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,558
thousand fold lower than what you might

1061
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,918
get from it from a cannabis plant

1062
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,398
but nevertheless um they recognize

1063
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,200
that these this small amount of

1064
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,479
cannabinoids

1065
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,759
was creating inhibition these are atcc

1066
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,798
organisms

1067
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,200
that are inhibited in a very

1068
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,480
strain-specific manner from this plant

1069
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,000
that makes 100 fold

1070
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,319
less cannabinoids than the cannabis

1071
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,679
plant so we believe this is happening in

1072
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,038
the cannabis plant we've been trying to

1073
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,399
track this down and measure it it's a

1074
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:35,599
very difficult experiment to do

1075
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,000
because you really have to control the

1076
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,439
terpenes to do it right but even if

1077
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,720
this so this experiment needs more

1078
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,679
replication because we don't have the

1079
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,919
terpenes

1080
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,038
uh controlled for but we have been

1081
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,278
seeing some stray

1082
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:48,079
strain to strain on our ct to see a few

1083
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:49,919
curves

1084
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,599
all right where the cfus come out very

1085
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,559
different the cts are on top of each

1086
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,839
other

1087
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,359
we believe that might be related to the

1088
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,000
different chemotypes that are being

1089
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,599
exposed

1090
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,038
in the plating process they're still

1091
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,240
present when you plate but they're gone

1092
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,200
when we purify

1093
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,159
the dna for for measuring the the dna

1094
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,640
types

1095
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,399
or at least the the the the viral the um

1096
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,320
the fungal load that's there

1097
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,158
the other thing that comes through uh in

1098
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,200
the canvas space are sometimes citrates

1099
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,320
in the candies

1100
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,798
these are listed on 3ms product as being

1101
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,359
inhibitory to their readout chemistry

1102
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,679
so the e coli is there but the readout

1103
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:26,639
chemistry isn't marking it all right so

1104
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,440
you can see the top row up here has lots

1105
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,840
of colonies

1106
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,278
and when you add the candy they they are

1107
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,359
decreased in number

1108
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,720
this is presumably due to the two

1109
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,158
citrates being uh

1110
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,159
affecting this you know citrates are

1111
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,760
quite common um some some cow mag

1112
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,159
systems have citrate in them so you've

1113
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,359
got a

1114
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,039
this could this is not just only in

1115
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,158
candy it could be in the in the aqua it

1116
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:45,599
could be present in some of the growing

1117
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,278
conditions

1118
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,119
um now i want to talk about a paper that

1119
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:49,839
was presented about a month ago about uh

1120
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,879
pcr

1121
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,240
not being a silver bullet and uh it was

1122
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,320
a good paper in that

1123
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,079
very few people have published on this

1124
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,599
problem we've put some publications out

1125
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,639
there zamir punja has put some out

1126
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,158
there's a group called thompson that

1127
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,679
puts them out in california

1128
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,960
looking at cannabis microbiomes and

1129
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,720
these are you can probably count the

1130
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,798
number of cannabis microbiome

1131
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,000
papers on on your two hands so it's a

1132
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,398
very it's a very

1133
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,200
um thin field at the moment so we very

1134
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,119
much

1135
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,480
welcome willow jumping into the space

1136
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,479
and measuring this

1137
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,839
however they they got about halfway

1138
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,038
through this uh compared to what we did

1139
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,480
in 2016.

1140
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:24,798
they noticed there was discordances

1141
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,240
between cfus and cts and that that can't

1142
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,639
be true

1143
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,679
however if you go one step further

1144
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,759
you'll notice

1145
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,960
this is not as much a reflection of the

1146
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,960
discordance

1147
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,798
in pcr as it is in the fact that none of

1148
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,240
the plating systems ever agree

1149
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,599
and if they were to step back and do

1150
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,038
this on multiple different plating

1151
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,158
formats they would recognize the

1152
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:43,359
variance they're seeing is actually

1153
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,559
related to the culture side of the

1154
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,398
equation not the pcr side

1155
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:47,599
equation so a few things they brought up

1156
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,079
that we agree with

1157
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,199
the its copy number can be a problem but

1158
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,480
we don't believe this is a bug we

1159
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,159
believe it's a feature as i mentioned

1160
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,798
earlier and if ninety percent of your

1161
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,240
cultures

1162
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,839
your organisms don't culture you have a

1163
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,919
zero versus one problem

1164
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,678
i'd rather have a one versus ten problem

1165
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,278
uh in this case they brought up its

1166
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,720
regions or 16s regions that have four

1167
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:05,200
fold more copies and one organism than

1168
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,120
the other

1169
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,240
and they attributed their differences to

1170
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,838
that it turns out their

1171
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,279
differences we believe we're going to do

1172
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,239
something else and we'll show we'll

1173
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,679
touch it on that

1174
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,039
um they also were concerned about kick

1175
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,838
contamination this is something we think

1176
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,800
is a canard

1177
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,639
um all of our customers run ntc's not no

1178
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,679
template controls and if any of those

1179
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,039
show signal we'd be

1180
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,200
we'd be hearing about it particularly if

1181
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,960
they showed a signal of a ct of 21 which

1182
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,960
would fail almost every sample

1183
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,159
that would fail all cannabis labs around

1184
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,838
the world would be failing if that were

1185
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,599
in fact a universal problem

1186
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:34,719
uh we actually think this relates to

1187
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,760
some of the primers that they're using

1188
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,439
and we'll walk you through

1189
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,280
um some of the pitfalls of designing

1190
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,878
primers in absence of knowledge of the

1191
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,159
cannabis genome which i think is uh what

1192
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,239
happened here

1193
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,398
uh they observed some overestimation of

1194
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,759
cfus to cts and i think this

1195
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,398
comes down to how you measure that on

1196
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,159
the plates and um let's dive into that

1197
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,598
so these are the primers that they use

1198
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,639
these aren't their primers per se

1199
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,919
they pulled them out of the literature

1200
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,160
but many of the people in the literature

1201
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,759
who designed these its primers

1202
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,598
did not anticipate running them with

1203
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,280
plants as the matrix in the background

1204
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,960
and plants have its regions that are

1205
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,320
very similar to fungi so

1206
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,679
if you pick the wrong primer sets you're

1207
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,880
going to amplify both and the copy

1208
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,759
number of the its regions in the

1209
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,358
cannabis genome are

1210
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,520
far higher than they are in the fungal

1211
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,960
genomes same thing's true with 16s

1212
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,239
sequences which is meant to target

1213
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,760
bacteria

1214
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,919
there are mitochondria that look like

1215
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,040
bacteria inside of plants and they are

1216
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,280
very high copy number

1217
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,559
and so if you don't design your 16s

1218
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,560
primers correctly you end up

1219
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,838
amplifying plant mitochondria thinking

1220
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,679
you have bacteria

1221
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,279
everything here in red is a perfect

1222
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,319
homology of the primers of the cannabis

1223
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,160
genome

1224
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,519
a lot of them have three prime homology

1225
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,719
which means they're going to amplify

1226
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,199
they're perfectly

1227
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,439
homologous so we'll um comb through a

1228
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:44,239
few of those alignments in a moment

1229
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,920
they're also using cyber green versus

1230
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,078
taqman cyber green

1231
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,000
has an intercalating dye in pcr that

1232
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,519
means that any product you make whether

1233
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,559
it's a primer dimer whether it's a

1234
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,000
cannabis amplicon

1235
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:55,838
or whether it's a fungal amplicon is

1236
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,519
going to give you signal cyber green

1237
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:58,960
tacman is far more specific than that

1238
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,639
there's a probe in there that has to

1239
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,679
match your target and only that gives

1240
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,598
you signal

1241
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,279
uh that's very critical for navigating

1242
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,519
high copy number its regions because you

1243
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,200
can design probes that actually target

1244
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,639
only one of the its regions as opposed

1245
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,639
to all of them and that can get you

1246
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,639
to normalize some of this its imbalance

1247
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,719
that's been that's been brought up

1248
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,920
um and as we mentioned earlier uh the

1249
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,358
study really didn't look at multiple

1250
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,880
forms of plating i think that's a major

1251
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:22,480
major weakness of it

1252
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,920
uh we've put this stuff public you're

1253
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,760
welcome to download this we'll have this

1254
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,960
thing available for folks to download

1255
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,400
later if they don't want to remember

1256
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,559
this in crazy long link

1257
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,320
but uh you can see these alignments of

1258
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,119
their primers the cannabis genome are

1259
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,800
full length

1260
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,039
and perfectly landing on the three prime

1261
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,720
end these will amplify cannabis

1262
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,480
all right so these are these these can't

1263
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,000
either throw these out there's no point

1264
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,280
in working with these in in the cannabis

1265
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,199
background you need something that won't

1266
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,480
do this we've published some that do

1267
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,239
uh we'll show you what those are in a

1268
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,519
moment uh but uh

1269
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,039
you you really want to be getting

1270
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,320
primers very specific and you want to

1271
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,400
get a probe in there if you can so you

1272
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,000
can drive higher specificity

1273
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,358
um so this is the work that they show

1274
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,559
there's actually some nice correlation

1275
00:36:57,358 --> 00:36:59,598
here it's just that they're offset a

1276
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,320
little bit

1277
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,079
uh these are the cqs these are the cfus

1278
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,519
and so this is actually really nice work

1279
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,800
it's just they're concerned over some of

1280
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,159
these gaps here

1281
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,079
but these gaps are between different

1282
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,920
organisms and the assumption this paper

1283
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,960
was that they should grow the same

1284
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,039
and we're going to show you is they

1285
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,720
don't um the other thing that we'd

1286
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,480
highlight is that

1287
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,559
this is suggesting just overnight

1288
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,400
culture we don't get away with just

1289
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:23,759
guessing the ct you can't guess the time

1290
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,960
frame you grow these either okay you

1291
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,640
have to be very specific here because

1292
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,079
the bacteria double every 30 minutes the

1293
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,358
vibrio doubles every 20 minutes

1294
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,039
the temperature is very important

1295
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,960
precision is needed here this would be

1296
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:33,519
like hiding the ct scale on any pcr

1297
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,920
paper

1298
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,519
the time matters but if you grow them

1299
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,240
the same time and under the same

1300
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:39,519
temperature

1301
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,879
on three different medias you get this

1302
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,719
picture here's bacillus which was

1303
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,119
mentioned in the paper here stuff

1304
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,078
if you grow them in lb versus 2xyt

1305
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,559
versus 3m

1306
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,680
here 3m gives you threefold more

1307
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,480
colonies

1308
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,759
than lb and 2xyt you move to bacillus

1309
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,559
and suddenly the colonies are enormous

1310
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,880
uh and you get almost no colonies on 3m

1311
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,920
and

1312
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,160
you get almost 20-fold more on an

1313
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,519
lb or you know 10 fold more 10 to 30

1314
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,920
fold more on 2xyt

1315
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:10,000
so just the failure to have a really

1316
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,159
defined cfu

1317
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,599
is it puts the whole field into chaos

1318
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,358
because depending on which one of these

1319
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,800
methods you use no one ever agrees

1320
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,239
all the labs point at one another

1321
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,359
headlines end up in the news and then

1322
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,519
all the consumers end up

1323
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,358
uh not having any camp confidence in the

1324
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,759
regulators all right uh we've really got

1325
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,078
to

1326
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,760
dial in uh on what we're measuring here

1327
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,480
so that we don't create this public

1328
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,720
panic

1329
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,039
uh and uh that we all understand exactly

1330
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,480
what it is we're measuring

1331
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,159
we've put all the primer alignments here

1332
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,838
public people can download these uh we

1333
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,759
realigned them actually to cs10 which is

1334
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,440
the genome that we didn't assemble so an

1335
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,079
independent party assembled that genome

1336
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,679
so

1337
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,519
uh perhaps that's less biased and taking

1338
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,519
a genome that we put public

1339
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,639
um and then finally i want to touch on

1340
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:50,480
just inclusivity and

1341
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,838
exclusivity i think this is the real key

1342
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,679
difference between the platforms the

1343
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,440
reason why you can have a more sensitive

1344
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,719
platform like pcr

1345
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,639
uh and have it fail less material

1346
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,838
is because it is more specific we don't

1347
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,920
have

1348
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,920
bacteria showing up where they shouldn't

1349
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,440
it also has more dynamic range

1350
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,079
you can get about seven logs of dynamic

1351
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,800
range

1352
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,440
with pcr and you struggle to get three

1353
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
with plating

1354
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,639
when you start to get out toward the

1355
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,920
third log in plating you have colonies

1356
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,799
on top of colonies and you start to

1357
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,480
undercount

1358
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,480
when you get extraordinarily low you

1359
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,679
can't discern plates that are negative

1360
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,519
from plates that someone just didn't

1361
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,598
pipette on there is no internal control

1362
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,838
in plating so once you get a blank plate

1363
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,599
you

1364
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,440
assume that's a past it could just as

1365
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,400
likely be someone who forgot to play

1366
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,159
anything

1367
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,680
uh with pcr you have that internal

1368
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,039
control that always tells you you

1369
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,960
amplified something the

1370
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,239
reaction worked as expected now you can

1371
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,679
measure off of that as to whether you

1372
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,399
should take the data and go forward with

1373
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,358
it

1374
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
this is something that's that's

1375
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:45,838
fundamentally missing in the plating

1376
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,440
environment

1377
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,279
now if you look at inclusion and

1378
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,280
exclusion criteria on many other

1379
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,040
systems there's usually around 30 to 50

1380
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,720
inclusion and exclusion criteria that

1381
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,679
gets done on some of these aoac tests

1382
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,078
right

1383
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,358
there this is the brochure from 3m i

1384
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,039
think there's actually a typo in this

1385
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,639
brochure they have they have 5 out of

1386
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,159
19. i think it's really really meant to

1387
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,719
have 15 of 19 here we'll give them the

1388
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:06,960
benefit

1389
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,318
out there but they're getting about 79

1390
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,720
if you assume that's 15

1391
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,440
grow but that means you know you've got

1392
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,959
21

1393
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,559
of the organisms that didn't grow and

1394
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,519
they cherry pick these organisms for

1395
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,440
their for their study

1396
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,400
right so what happens when you don't get

1397
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,760
the cherry pick them and you take

1398
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,720
something off of a cannabis matrix right

1399
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,000
the numbers are probably going to be

1400
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,919
much lower than this

1401
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,199
and then down here on exclusivity they

1402
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,280
get 21

1403
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,879
of the of the colonies are bacterial all

1404
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,760
right so these things are not excluding

1405
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,519
the bacteria

1406
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,119
and they're not picking up all the fungi

1407
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,159
uh when you look at this

1408
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,440
with pcr the numbers are much cleaner um

1409
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:41,838
the other thing that's going on with pcr

1410
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,679
is that you can go beyond uh each one of

1411
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:44,799
these organisms from htc may cost you a

1412
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:46,078
hundred to three hundred dollars to

1413
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,200
order so if you want to order thousands

1414
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,560
of them it's going to take a very long

1415
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,078
time to be very expensive endeavor

1416
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,318
however with pcr

1417
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,440
you know what amplicons amplify with

1418
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:55,039
your primers and then you can

1419
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,400
extrapolate how many other organisms

1420
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,079
would amplify if you just scan them

1421
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,358
against ncbi and we can get into the

1422
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,960
thousands of organisms

1423
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,719
with pcr that will have confidence of

1424
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,079
amplification that cannot be said with

1425
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:05,279
plating because you can't anticipate

1426
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,200
what's going to plate

1427
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,319
uh based on given carbon source is very

1428
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,318
difficult

1429
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,079
so when we look at this stuff with pcr

1430
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,119
the the selectivity is much better

1431
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,000
we have 96 uh we basically

1432
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,318
ordered 52 organisms from htcc 50 of

1433
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,239
them

1434
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,358
were able to detect in 90 minutes uh

1435
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,358
whereas you're looking at what's going

1436
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,159
on in plating and it's like 15 out of 19

1437
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,400
in three days

1438
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,199
much rather have 90 minutes and 96 and

1439
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,960
79

1440
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,960
in three days then you look at the

1441
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,880
bacteria side of things they're getting

1442
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,400
you know 21 of the organisms there being

1443
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,800
bacteria we don't get any

1444
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,318
all right this is why other systems are

1445
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,839
this is why culture is failing more is

1446
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,000
because when bacteria is present and

1447
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,159
some people do use bacteria as

1448
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,639
uh as some type of additive to for

1449
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,239
beneficial uh microbial

1450
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,000
usage in the plants that stuff will

1451
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,039
carry through and can wreck your your

1452
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,199
plating caps

1453
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,159
all right the other thing you can do is

1454
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,000
take these um

1455
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,118
primer sequences these were published

1456
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,920
you're welcome to grab them and check

1457
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,838
yourself

1458
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,159
uh you can take these things and scan

1459
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,440
them against uh well-curated databases

1460
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:04,879
the important thing to do is to make

1461
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,800
sure they're packed bio assemblies

1462
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,480
because the its regions don't always

1463
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,920
assemble perfectly with illumina data

1464
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,119
but if you create the data data

1465
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,838
appropriately you can see that we can

1466
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,318
get reached

1467
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,159
thousands of organisms i've not seen any

1468
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,838
total yeasts and mold tests out there

1469
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,759
that can claim that they've grown

1470
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:21,039
thousands of organisms and prove that

1471
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,400
they'll grow on their culture system

1472
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,920
they usually stop at around 100

1473
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,920
because it's too expensive and takes too

1474
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,079
much time not to mention a lot of them

1475
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,760
just don't grow

1476
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,318
so this kind of brings us to the final

1477
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,160
point is does qpcr fail more samples

1478
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,679
well in the case of michigan we

1479
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:38,078
certainly did because they moved to

1480
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,879
a system that has very high selective

1481
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,480
pressure

1482
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,838
uh however when you look back at some of

1483
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,559
the publications we never resorted to a

1484
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:46,239
single medium

1485
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,920
we when we do this in the past we would

1486
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,759
triangulate this across three different

1487
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,400
culture systems you see down below three

1488
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,680
mp3 films biolumix and sim plates

1489
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,358
and we would have to average the cfu

1490
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,159
results from those three platforms and

1491
00:42:57,358 --> 00:42:59,920
then draw

1492
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,239
calibrate the cfu curve according to the

1493
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,680
average of the three platforms

1494
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,039
now that means when you compare yourself

1495
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,159
against any given one of them you're not

1496
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:07,679
going to be perfect

1497
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,118
but it does mean when we're dealing with

1498
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:10,639
a marketplace where every customer might

1499
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,599
be comparing this to a different plating

1500
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:16,879
system it's probably the safest approach

1501
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,880
but what else you will notice going on

1502
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,559
in this study is we looked at what the

1503
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,640
dna content looked like

1504
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,318
directly off the canvas plant and what

1505
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,159
happened after you cultured it

1506
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,440
and what we found was radically

1507
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,039
different results based on the culture

1508
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,800
platform that you used

1509
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,000
um this is this is public you can go

1510
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,640
view it for yourself it's been peer

1511
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,400
reviewed

1512
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,400
it's a transparent review system i think

1513
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,519
um john mcpartlin and ethan russo

1514
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,760
involved in that

1515
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,280
uh and so there's um there's a wealth of

1516
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,400
information on there as to how things

1517
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,400
change when you apply

1518
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,960
culture to the actual microbial content

1519
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,440
but uh the real problem here is that we

1520
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,679
have

1521
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,639
exquisite sensitivity and specificity

1522
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,239
with pcr

1523
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,400
and culture has no idea what the hell

1524
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,239
it's measuring so it's very difficult to

1525
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,760
have these discussions with folks on

1526
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,679
uh why are there differences between

1527
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,000
these platforms when the culture folks

1528
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,838
are

1529
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,358
kind of staring at tarot cards and we're

1530
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,599
bringing forward whole genome sequencing

1531
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:05,598
data

1532
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,519
now the other thing you can do with pcr

1533
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,960
once you have this running is you can

1534
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:12,880
tackle things that don't culture

1535
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,079
uh powdery mildew doesn't culture the

1536
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,318
viruses don't culture

1537
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,160
uh so we have helped many grows using

1538
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,400
hops latent thyroid testing and lettuce

1539
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,000
chlorosis virus testing using pcr

1540
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,838
so they can avoid problems like this

1541
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,760
that happen this is a grow that actually

1542
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:27,358
adopted pcr and was able to

1543
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,880
clean out their their lcd and their

1544
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:30,400
obsolete and thyroid infections

1545
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,000
uh and get their yields back up another

1546
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,599
40 percent because this was wrecking

1547
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,838
them late late in row so

1548
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,359
it's a platform that uh we don't yet

1549
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:38,639
know whether these viruses play any role

1550
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,078
in human health but they certainly play

1551
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,759
a role in plant health and so it's a

1552
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,560
universal platform that can help plant

1553
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,240
health and whole

1554
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,639
and also bring to some color on human

1555
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,159
health all right so in conclusions here

1556
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,078
there is a clinical paradox going on

1557
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,920
with culture-based methods

1558
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,599
you really need robust homogenization

1559
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,039
just for good sampling statistics and to

1560
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,920
deal with these clumps that occur with

1561
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,838
canadia

1562
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,358
and this is orthogonal to viability if

1563
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,920
you want to get at the endophytes

1564
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,838
you have to aggressively homogenize the

1565
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,599
sample which is going to shred up

1566
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,920
microbes so they're not viable

1567
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,760
uh so the best thing we believe is just

1568
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,960
lice that all open and measure the dna

1569
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,640
and you're going to get the best proxy

1570
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,920
for what's going on

1571
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,239
you know the number one clinical

1572
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,760
liability in cannabis is is aspergillus

1573
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:18,959
without a doubt if you go come to the

1574
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,640
clinical literature most of the

1575
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,880
aspergillosis that's going on and

1576
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,559
any clinical death it's not thc content

1577
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,358
it's not mycotoxins it's not heavy

1578
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,400
metals

1579
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:28,960
it is people that are getting

1580
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,920
aspergillosis usually immunocompromised

1581
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,559
and uh this is an endophyte if we adopt

1582
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,480
methods

1583
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:35,920
that select against aspergillus growth

1584
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,760
with drbc and

1585
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,960
with against endophytes because we're

1586
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,359
resorting to culture

1587
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,000
we are playing a game that the patient's

1588
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:46,159
not going to be pleased with

1589
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,760
so we would argue uh you want to move to

1590
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:49,598
molecular methods that can

1591
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,200
properly lice all these things and that

1592
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,079
you want to get the regulations to

1593
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:54,399
adequately uh allow those things if you

1594
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,519
will

1595
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,519
if you anchor everything in cfu language

1596
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:00,639
particularly very vague and non-specific

1597
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:01,838
cfu language

1598
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,480
you're gonna you're just gonna invite

1599
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,318
laboratory fights for the next decade

1600
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,760
uh now in doing so you have to pay

1601
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,759
attention to live dead

1602
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,200
and uh we have uh that's probably a

1603
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,800
whole other webinar is how we deal with

1604
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,559
that but live dead can be tackled with

1605
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,839
pcr that is another myth that it can't

1606
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,119
handle that but there are multiple

1607
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:18,318
techniques that are being utilized in

1608
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,440
the field to manage the light dead

1609
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,759
situation from

1610
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,119
centrifugation to enrichment to um to

1611
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,400
using nucleases

1612
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,760
but it is doable uh so

1613
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,200
the other the other infections that we

1614
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,040
have seen in the field there has been

1615
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,519
fusarium cutaneous infections all right

1616
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,279
this is

1617
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,960
also a plant endophyte there have been

1618
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,319
cryptococcal meningitis infections from

1619
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,679
pre-rolls it was this was measured in

1620
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:39,838
bakersfield california this is

1621
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:40,879
also an endophyte uh the other things

1622
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,639
that have come up are salmonella and

1623
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,318
mycobacteria these are epiphytes these

1624
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,519
are bacteria that are on the surface

1625
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,838
all right these probably can be

1626
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,400
addressed with either pcr or plating

1627
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,199
um now the it's really the epiphytes

1628
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,800
that we have to turn

1629
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:54,078
our attention to now there is a lot of

1630
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,680
jurisdictional heterogeneity out there

1631
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,519
not everyone's requiring total use and

1632
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,118
mold california luckily got rid of it

1633
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:00,639
and they move toward all molecular

1634
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,720
methods looking at aspergillus in a

1635
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,799
species-specific manner

1636
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,480
there is there's also this question of

1637
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,880
what is the clinical actionability of 10

1638
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,559
000 cfus or 100 000 cfus of

1639
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,240
these total things which we've shown you

1640
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,440
are not total things they are partial

1641
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,118
things

1642
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,318
and they're not necessarily measuring

1643
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,760
anything of clinical relevance they're

1644
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,000
just counting colonies

1645
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,760
at this point and they don't even have a

1646
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,039
good sense of what the colony is whether

1647
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,359
it's bacterial or fungi

1648
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,800
or whether it's harmful or not and we're

1649
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:28,799
doing this exercise

1650
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,000
all well knowing that the vast majority

1651
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,079
of microbes don't even culture

1652
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,760
so it's it's really uh an interesting i

1653
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,559
think security theater

1654
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,400
now the um the other thing that comes

1655
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,760
into play here is

1656
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,440
when you start using these very

1657
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,280
grotesque tools like total yeast and

1658
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,960
mold and total rope account is you

1659
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,559
basically eliminate the growers ability

1660
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,039
to use beneficial microbes

1661
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,240
because those light those systems up i

1662
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,239
don't know where that pushes them is it

1663
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,279
pushing into pesticide use

1664
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,399
you know where do they go but they're

1665
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,640
going to need to do something to fight

1666
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,318
back pathogens and

1667
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,759
putting in these non-specific tests with

1668
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:00,960
no clinical utility basically strips

1669
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,400
away one of their most

1670
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,039
green environmental tools that they

1671
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,039
could be using

1672
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,879
so inclusions we think the cfu is an

1673
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,280
abused non-specific term

1674
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,119
uh even in the bam uh there is a lot of

1675
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,839
latitude on on what type of plating you

1676
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,400
can use

1677
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:18,318
and this means people could adopt and

1678
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,838
lab shop based on labs who use the most

1679
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,679
stringent plating systems that fail the

1680
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:22,799
least amount of material

1681
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:24,159
we think the regulations should be

1682
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,519
modernized in line with where the fda

1683
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:28,078
and the cdc are going

1684
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,920
uh we believe the the desire to actually

1685
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,480
keep this grounded in culture because

1686
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,639
that is

1687
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,240
that they because you believe that's the

1688
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,719
only way that you can sequence a genome

1689
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,838
is patently false and can be shown

1690
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:39,039
throughout the literature that that is

1691
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:40,558
no longer the case you can sequence

1692
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,838
genomes without culture quite readily

1693
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,839
today it's quite uh

1694
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:44,880
it's quite modern and it's done

1695
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,920
routinely for

1696
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,039
for even rna viruses like sars we think

1697
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,800
total tests are

1698
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,159
um you know security theater as i've

1699
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,680
mentioned before they're not giving us

1700
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:54,879
any clinical utility they're creating a

1701
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:55,598
tremendous amount of friction in the

1702
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,760
labs

1703
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,039
uh making labs uproot and change the

1704
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,599
different testing techniques that they

1705
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:01,358
need

1706
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,200
and not necessarily giving any benefit

1707
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:04,639
to the uh to the consumer in fact we

1708
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,118
believe what happened in michigan

1709
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:08,719
is going to add risk to the consumer

1710
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,358
even though that was the exact opposite

1711
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:14,959
of what the regulators were looking for

1712
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:16,719
so we believe that this can be tuned

1713
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,480
with pcr but we need to get together

1714
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:19,039
with many of the regulators in the labs

1715
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,880
to

1716
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,400
structure what those regulations should

1717
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,920
be and how they should be written and we

1718
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,200
ask everyone in this audience to try and

1719
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,039
share this information with them if they

1720
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,719
can because we do think it is time

1721
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,800
to recraft these and modernize these

1722
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,279
regulations species-specific testing

1723
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,240
would make far more sense in our mind

1724
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,119
with that i'm going to leave it for

1725
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:37,519
questions because i think i'm running

1726
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,519
out of time

1727
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,519
all right thank you kevin for a great

1728
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,280
presentation

1729
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,039
just to remind everyone if you do have a

1730
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,599
question to ask of kevin

1731
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:50,800
the q a icon at the bottom of your

1732
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:55,359
screen is the best way to do that

1733
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:57,039
we will ask those as they come in

1734
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,838
just give a minute to see if any

1735
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:59,838
populate here

1736
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:08,000
all right um this one's from sherry

1737
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:10,399
pearson how can we move forward with

1738
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,838
the state of maryland tomorrow is moving

1739
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,838
to culturing

1740
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,318
uh yeah i don't know how to get through

1741
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,920
the state of maryland um

1742
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:21,279
there is uh nothing about what they're

1743
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,358
doing down there that that can be

1744
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,720
justified in scientific literature

1745
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:26,318
they they want to push everything into

1746
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,919
culture and the justification i heard

1747
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,519
was that they want to do that so that

1748
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,639
they can sequence things so

1749
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,318
someone down there needs to read a

1750
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,318
biology book that they can actually

1751
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:36,800
sequence these things without culturing

1752
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:37,920
um and in fact most people before they

1753
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,480
want to sequence something is they

1754
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,119
purify the dna like you do for pcr

1755
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,440
um so i suspect uh there's going to be a

1756
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,559
lot of turmoil in maryland

1757
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,159
and uh that this

1758
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,680
needs to get out to the patients the

1759
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:53,039
patients need to know that if they push

1760
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,719
them in the direction

1761
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,880
the direction that they're going there's

1762
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,118
going to be more cannabis on the market

1763
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,800
that has risk associated with it and

1764
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,240
that liability should fall right back to

1765
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,519
the regulator who's doing this on no

1766
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:05,519
scientific grounds whatsoever

1767
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,440
okay um another question here about

1768
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:12,960
um live dead i was wondering if you

1769
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,800
could expand a bit more

1770
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,199
on what capabilities are out there for

1771
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,800
that so live dead has

1772
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,639
um there's a couple ways we've skinned

1773
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,039
that cat uh there is a step

1774
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,400
in our yeast and mold there's two

1775
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,239
different ways we've come about trying

1776
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,079
to address this

1777
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,679
our yeast and mold system right now has

1778
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,480
an enzymatic lysis that's

1779
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:33,440
lysing open more fungi than we were

1780
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,039
doing last year

1781
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,960
this is a recent update that we put out

1782
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,719
to address the candidate issues

1783
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,480
that enzyme is not compatible with the

1784
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,078
nucleases that we were using for live

1785
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,159
dead so we've switched that over to a

1786
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,280
centrifugation based step where you spin

1787
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:49,199
and pellet the cells down leave the

1788
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,720
free circulating dna in solution with

1789
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,639
that pelleting step

1790
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:56,799
and then isolate that that pellet

1791
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,799
what we used to do in the past was use a

1792
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,720
nuclease we can still use that nuclease

1793
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,079
for live dead in our other assays and

1794
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:03,679
that's what we do

1795
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,119
we use a nucleus that doesn't penetrate

1796
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:07,039
cell membranes and eats up free

1797
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,960
circulating dna but however

1798
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,639
right now that enzyme is not compatible

1799
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,000
with the tlp enzyme we're using to

1800
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:13,440
lysosome the um

1801
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,039
the fungi so we have a we have a

1802
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,400
bifurcated approach on the test right

1803
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,199
now for live dead

1804
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,760
um and that's uh that that's one way to

1805
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:21,118
address it

1806
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,480
the other way people some we've seen

1807
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,079
other people address this is to grow a

1808
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,079
little bit uh enrich for

1809
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,318
x x amount of time and only the

1810
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,839
replicative organisms will replicate

1811
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,759
the ones that are dead will get drowned

1812
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:33,759
out you then have to adjust your cts

1813
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,079
accordingly to your doubling rate um and

1814
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,359
so

1815
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,079
there's there's that's that's an

1816
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:40,000
alternative approach but uh it it can be

1817
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,280
it can be dealt with and i think the

1818
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,318
providers in the field are all coming up

1819
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,240
with their own creative ways

1820
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,558
to do this all right great uh this next

1821
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,078
one

1822
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,839
is from brett lorenz how much of a risk

1823
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:55,359
do you think mycotoxins are

1824
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:58,159
in the cannabis market i it's a very

1825
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:01,598
good question of mycotoxins um

1826
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:03,838
i have not seen um any papers

1827
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,960
suggesting poisoning of these things i

1828
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:05,838
know that this is something that's a

1829
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,679
chronic problem

1830
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:08,880
uh you don't tend to get an acute effect

1831
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,199
with mycotoxins you

1832
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,039
tends to be damaged over over long haul

1833
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:14,318
um i've also not seen a lot of

1834
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,079
literature on the failure rates for

1835
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:17,838
mycotoxins i know i know we have a lot

1836
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,200
of

1837
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:20,719
states that are mandating these things

1838
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,558
but when i have surveyed them and asked

1839
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:23,838
around most of the labs say they

1840
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,559
rarely ever fail something for

1841
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,358
mycotoxins so you know mycotoxins are

1842
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,319
usually

1843
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,440
synthesized in a saprophytic state and i

1844
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,358
don't know that the cannabis

1845
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,039
plants ever get there i think they're

1846
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:36,639
they're mostly at a state where they've

1847
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,639
been quickly cured and they get to the

1848
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,318
customer before anything rots

1849
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,759
uh and so this is uh i it's i'm not

1850
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,599
we a long time ago we had a program

1851
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,960
trying to build an amino pcr system that

1852
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,880
would pick these things up and we

1853
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,880
put it on ice because we were just not

1854
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,559
seeing enough data in the field that the

1855
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,640
fail rates were high enough to justify

1856
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,200
the test so we thought longer term

1857
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:58,239
people may um if we have five years of

1858
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:59,199
no fails of that i would imagine

1859
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,118
regulators will just

1860
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,399
pass pass on it no longer insist on it

1861
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,838
but um

1862
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,000
it uh you know the one area we have

1863
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:08,880
um throwing up some caution is that

1864
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,239
there are

1865
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,160
a paper that we publish showing that

1866
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:12,719
there are microtoxins that are being

1867
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:14,239
made

1868
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:15,919
by some penicillin species that

1869
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:16,959
interfere with the anti-epileptic

1870
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,079
properties of cbd

1871
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,240
and that might be something that's

1872
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,720
really meaningful for the epilepsy

1873
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:24,159
crowd so um that's an area that needs

1874
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,239
more more work to know

1875
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:27,440
how much citrine and paxilline can we

1876
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:29,838
actually tolerate

1877
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,838
on this when you when you're trying to

1878
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:33,759
extract these things for

1879
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:35,119
patients in the epileps in the epilepsy

1880
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,960
field the extraction process might

1881
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,400
enrich these things above and beyond the

1882
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,000
levels that they're in the flower

1883
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,000
and that could have some negative

1884
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,798
consequences but we're not scanning

1885
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,400
right now

1886
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:45,358
uh i haven't seen any regulations out

1887
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,599
there that are looking for the

1888
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,119
penicillin-based mycotoxins so i i think

1889
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,440
that's kind of an unknown field at the

1890
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,440
moment

1891
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,280
okay another question here from eric

1892
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:58,000
lieber who is an

1893
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,079
arizona local and wants to know how we

1894
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,280
can find out if his state is using

1895
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,839
culture testing or

1896
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,839
pcr

1897
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,480
any guidance there

1898
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,639
i'm sorry i broke up a little bit there

1899
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,719
oh i'm sorry

1900
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:19,598
i'll ask it again um there's someone

1901
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:22,318
here from arizona who is curious to

1902
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,960
find out if there's anywhere he can find

1903
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,599
out

1904
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,480
if the state is using or allowing

1905
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,838
culture or

1906
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,838
or qpcr testing

1907
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,240
uh that's a good question i think i have

1908
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:35,679
to you know

1909
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:36,959
deflect that to somebody else here who

1910
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,519
might be more familiar with exactly

1911
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,960
what's going on in arizona i did read

1912
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,798
like this week in the news that there

1913
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,358
was some aspergillus outbreak

1914
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,239
in arizona and i also read somewhere

1915
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:48,159
that they're moving

1916
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:50,078
to plating which didn't seem or they're

1917
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:51,838
removing aspergillus testing altogether

1918
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,318
and that seemed

1919
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,279
odd considering they just had some news

1920
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,519
of that in in

1921
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,359
the media but um yeah i have to i'll

1922
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,798
have to get back to you on that one

1923
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:02,480
someone here knows the answer to that i

1924
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,000
just don't have the top of my head

1925
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,679
yeah eric if you're listening if you

1926
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,639
want to shoot us an email info

1927
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,440
at medicinalgenomics.com we can route

1928
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,480
that to the

1929
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,200
appropriate person to follow up um

1930
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,480
all right one more here coming back to

1931
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,838
live dead

1932
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,400
um does your solution for live dead

1933
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:22,798
remove

1934
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,480
only free dna or will it also remove dna

1935
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:25,358
from dead cells that have not released

1936
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,798
their dna

1937
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:32,000
into solution so that's a good question

1938
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:35,199
um i the nucleus does not penetrate

1939
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,239
the cell membrane um and the question is

1940
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:40,159
if there's a ruptured membrane will it

1941
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:40,959
get in there and still chew up the dna

1942
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:43,920
inside

1943
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,318
so i don't think we have proof of that i

1944
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,480
would

1945
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,599
i would hypothesize that it would but i

1946
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,358
don't i've got to think through how to

1947
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,119
sort of experiment that would

1948
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:54,000
that would sort that out that that seems

1949
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,519
to be a bit um that might be tricky to

1950
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,039
start getting some microscopy involved

1951
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:58,960
but um

1952
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,239
i would you know that we do know the the

1953
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,318
weight of the

1954
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,239
the molecular weight of the actual

1955
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,759
enzyme so it doesn't need to be a very

1956
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:06,479
big hole for this thing to get in so i

1957
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,400
would imagine

1958
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,679
it would chew it up if there's if the

1959
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,519
membrane is ruptured but

1960
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:14,558
we've not set up any experiments to

1961
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:16,639
directly address that question

1962
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,760
all right one more came in and i'm gonna

1963
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:19,199
sneak it in here

1964
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,599
have you heard of any interference

1965
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,679
between rapid 3m yeast and mold plates

1966
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:27,519
and certain cannabis products such as

1967
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:28,000
seeds or nut butters oh that's a good

1968
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:30,400
question

1969
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,400
i have not heard anything directly on

1970
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,760
those i've heard mostly from candies

1971
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,639
but um that is you know there

1972
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,799
there is some literature out there on um

1973
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,639
in the food testing space

1974
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:44,318
that when you move to a lot of spices

1975
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:46,558
you have to revalidate things because

1976
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:48,079
the spices have lots of active compounds

1977
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,798
that can throw off some of the

1978
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:52,079
some of the testing platforms um i'll

1979
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:53,119
have to dig up those references i can't

1980
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,960
recall whether they were directly

1981
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,119
addressing 3m or biomary u or

1982
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,079
what platform that was specific to but

1983
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,079
um i think

1984
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,599
you know coomeron was one that came up

1985
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,839
as being an inhibitor to many of these

1986
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,838
things

1987
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:09,199
all right i think that's all the time we

1988
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,640
have today thanks thank you kevin for

1989
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,239
