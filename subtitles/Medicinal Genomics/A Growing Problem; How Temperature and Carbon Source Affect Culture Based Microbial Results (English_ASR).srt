1
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,480
good morning everyone

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,800
all right

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,599
my name is yvonne and i work for

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,039
medicinal genomics not only do i hand

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,839
out drink tickets but i also manage the

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,840
r d team

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
so

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,039
plating

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,640
plating methods are considered to be the

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,118
gold standard

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,280
the petri dish was invented in 1887.

12
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,920
and

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
the phone

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,920
1887.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,480
this is the phone in 18 oh crap sorry

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
this is the phone in 1887. is this not

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,519
working

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,840
this is the cell phone today

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,000
now if i told you all to take take your

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,760
cell phones away and you can only rely

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,600
on the newspaper for your information

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,718
you would think that i'm crazy

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,960
yet we rely on petri dishes to give us

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,359
results for microbial testing

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,478
and we think that qpcr or

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,280
molecular methods aren't as good

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,879
now i beg to differ

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,719
you're growing on a plate

29
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,280
how do you know what it is unless you're

30
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,280
a trained mycologist who has years of

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,439
training it's very difficult to

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,519
determine what's growing on your plate

33
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,000
and even if you do know what's growing

34
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,640
on your plate there are things that look

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
very similar for instance aspergillus

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,159
niger

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,400
aspergillus niger has also been mistaken

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,640
for aspergillus brazilians and they were

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,799
once deemed the same but through

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,680
molecular techniques they've determined

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,799
that they are actually different species

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,000
so

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,000
why are we still doing this

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
you know

45
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,758
let's bring it into the next

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,359
to the 21st century

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,920
we have the ability we have the

48
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,959
technology why are we still relying on a

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,320
standard that's 135 years old

50
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,919
for instance salmonella testing

51
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,078
you can target portions of the

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,079
salmonella genome and run molecular

53
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,359
methods and determine that it's

54
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,639
salmonella within as little of a 16 hour

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
incubation

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,719
yet if you were to confirm salmonella on

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
plating methods that could take up to

58
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,840
three days

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,120
and then they want you at the end of

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,280
three days of plating and confirmation

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
to send that sample

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,919
back for sequencing to confirm that your

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,599
three days of plating was right

64
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,518
why are we doing this

65
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,159
and there are some state regulators out

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,200
there that aren't allowing molecular

67
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,719
methods for species specific detection

68
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,598
it's crazy

69
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,359
right

70
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,318
why are we doing this why are we making

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,640
it more difficult than it needs to be

72
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,119
so we've been publishing on these

73
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,199
problems since 2015

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,080
the past eight years this is what i do

75
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,238
on a daily basis try to explain and

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,879
educate people why

77
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,200
plating methods aren't the gold standard

78
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,518
that everybody thinks that they are

79
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,958
most recently we published this past

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,759
february and i'm going to touch upon

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,759
some of that data a bit

82
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,280
i want to go back to a study that we did

83
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,639
last year um with michigan

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,280
and trying to

85
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,119
determine total yeast and mold that's

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,719
another problem totals but we can get

87
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
into that later

88
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,560
so

89
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,359
there was sample it was collected it was

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,000
homogenized by third third party lab and

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,120
distributed it was broken up into a high

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,479
medium and low categories and it was

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,158
plated on three different types of

94
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,359
plates

95
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:38,878
these are the three different types of

96
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
plates that were used in this study and

97
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,079
as you can see these three particular

98
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,640
plates

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,840
are supposed to be isolating

100
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,839
yeast mold fungi

101
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,318
yet when you look at these plates you

102
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,479
see

103
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,119
very different results

104
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,199
the top row is drbc plating and you can

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,000
see there's a lot fewer colonies growing

106
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,399
on these plates than at the bottom which

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,759
is potato dextrose agar

108
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,319
now

109
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,158
to a lab technician that doesn't know

110
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,238
the difference between a bacterial

111
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,000
colony and a yeast and mold colony

112
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,360
you're going to get very different

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,840
results

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,959
the pda the blue dots that you see are

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,879
counts

116
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,600
the majority of those blue dots that are

117
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,879
being counted for totally used in mold

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,879
are actually bacterial

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,680
this is some sequencing that we had done

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,520
we picked colonies from these plates

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,840
and we put them through genomic

122
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,120
sequencing to see what they actually

123
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,039
were

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,280
and on the three plates that are

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,479
supposed to be growing yeast mold and

126
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,039
fungi

127
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,560
you see that bacteria is indeed growing

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,520
on these plates

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,879
and what's really interesting is

130
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,159
oh

131
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,839
can you advance

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,080
what there should be a circle that comes

133
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,478
up can i do that

134
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,240
yes sorry

135
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,560
so it's really difficult to see what

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,439
that circle up at the top says but it's

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,478
a actual bacteria by the known the name

138
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,240
of pantoa algomerans

139
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,120
now pantoa

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,038
is a gram negative which makes it an

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,079
entero

142
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,038
um lactose fermenting bacteria lactose

143
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,680
from fermenting makes it a coliform so

144
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:29,279
we got a bacteria

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,840
it's an entero and it's also a coliform

146
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,319
and it has actually recently been in

147
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,279
2019 there was a publication

148
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:41,038
as a growth promoter for cannabis

149
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,079
okay so now we have a bacteria that is

150
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,038
used

151
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,599
to help

152
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,319
grow cannabis

153
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,879
it's also been known to show in skin

154
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,719
infections in humans so you could have

155
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,478
this growth promoting bacteria on your

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,880
cannabis plants and then you have your

157
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:00,560
trimmers come and trim it up and they

158
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,600
get skin infections what's going on

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,639
so we have done previously previous

160
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,479
studies on different microbiomes and we

161
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,680
found that in

162
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:15,120
30 of the 172 microbiomes that we've

163
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,280
surveyed pantoa glomerulons has come up

164
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,399
so this was interesting so we decided to

165
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,318
look at this

166
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:24,318
with an actual atcc culture

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,280
oh just to touch back so i said it was a

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,919
bacteria it's an entero it's a coliform

169
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,038
therefore it's a btgn

170
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,439
these

171
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:37,199
are the different states that regulate

172
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,600
that have regulations for those tests

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,478
i believe the top

174
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,919
this is states that have a total aerobic

175
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,159
regulation

176
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,159
these are states that have a coliform

177
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,080
these are states that have an intro and

178
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,840
i don't know why it's not showing and

179
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,399
this one over here has btg and

180
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,959
requirement so

181
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,839
that's important

182
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:04,159
so we take this pantola algorithms and

183
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,119
we incubate it and we put it on plates

184
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,720
and

185
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,120
for this particular plate this is a

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,280
total aerobic complete it's a rapid

187
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,360
total aerobic complaint as as you can

188
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,959
see with the manufacturer's instructions

189
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,280
it says to grow it at 35 degrees plus or

190
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,879
minus 2 degrees for 24 hours plus or

191
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,119
minus 2 hours

192
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,279
and when you do that at

193
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,759
the recommended growth temperature you

194
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,478
can see at the bottom there's no growth

195
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,400
yet if you grow it at 30 degrees or you

196
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,159
grow it at 26 degrees

197
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,598
you do have growth

198
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,520
so if labs are following the recommended

199
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,639
manufacturer's documentation for this

200
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
which

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,840
they haven't tested it in a cannabis

202
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,839
matrix with which any um just said was a

203
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,918
very important factor it is it needs to

204
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,719
be tested in cannabis matrix you get

205
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,560
very different results

206
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,360
and i said that it was also an

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,439
enterobacteria well we grow it on the

208
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
plates at the recommended

209
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,279
temperature

210
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,560
and at two differing temperatures

211
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,559
and you get no growth

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,598
coliform plates they said it was also a

213
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,399
coliform this is what happens when you

214
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:17,519
plate it on a coliform plate 26 degrees

215
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:20,478
you see it 30 30 degrees you see it

216
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,639
36 degrees it's there but it's minimal

217
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,318
so if you're having

218
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,038
labs test

219
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,360
for these organisms at the recommended

220
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,159
temperatures and they're not showing up

221
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,159
they're passing it

222
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,679
this isn't a fluke this is another

223
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,680
organism this is aeromodus hydrophylla

224
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,478
you see the same thing

225
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,120
and this is a bacteria that causes

226
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
gastroenterol

227
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,159
entero

228
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,879
titus and 13

229
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,519
of humans

230
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,838
yet when you do qpcr methods or

231
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,879
molecular methods

232
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,760
temperature doesn't matter

233
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,039
and

234
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,759
you detect it across the assays

235
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,799
so again why are we relying on a gold

236
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,799
standard that is missing stuff and then

237
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,319
molecular methods

238
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,919
well

239
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,200
why doesn't it match

240
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,799
it doesn't match because you're

241
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
comparing two totally different

242
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,479
technologies

243
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,360
so

244
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,680
we did another

245
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
experiment and this was in matrix this

246
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,359
is a hemp sample

247
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,399
and we decided to test this hemp sample

248
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,560
divide 10 grams three different bags

249
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,480
test it at three different temperatures

250
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,399
three different plating types

251
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,360
three different scientists processing

252
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,120
so

253
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,039
with the qpcr method there's no

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,440
incubation up front for these these

255
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,480
particular tests for species specific

256
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
that's different i'm not going to get

257
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,360
into that right now so we did an initial

258
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,559
time point and then we incubated those

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,080
bags for 24 hours

260
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,799
no incubation

261
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,480
three temperatures which weren't really

262
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,958
put at their temperature yet so that's

263
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,039
this is showing

264
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,879
why doesn't it like

265
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,319
okay i don't know why it doesn't show up

266
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,200
over there but

267
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,040
so three bags three scientists pretty

268
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
similar results

269
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,120
this this green one over here is an

270
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,240
outlier unfortunately that's me but what

271
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,839
are you gonna do

272
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,039
so

273
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,720
the average cfu for these

274
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:31,519
tests right here is 150 000 cfus if that

275
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,160
was a total aerobic test that would fail

276
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,480
if that was an intro that would fail

277
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:40,639
if it was a coliform it would fail

278
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,879
you incubate those at their respective

279
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:48,399
temperatures for 24 hours it goes from

280
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:49,439
150 000 cfus to over six million cfus

281
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,720
clearly

282
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,040
what's on that plant on that flower

283
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,639
is alive and growing

284
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,799
yet

285
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:03,039
when you played it

286
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:05,439
24 hours three temperatures

287
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,838
it would pass

288
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,360
48 hours all of a sudden you start

289
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,160
seeing stuff

290
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,079
and 72 hours it's it's essentially the

291
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,120
same as the 48 they're just a little

292
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,559
larger

293
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,200
okay that's one carbon source

294
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,439
you change your carbon source

295
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,720
totally different results

296
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,560
this is 2xyt agar

297
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,480
26 degrees is where you're seeing that

298
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,838
growth you're not seeing that 30 and

299
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,839
you're not seen at 36.

300
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,559
this is lb argor

301
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,800
again similar types results

302
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,518
so what's going on here

303
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,319
well there's a couple of things

304
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,919
not all organisms grow at the same rate

305
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,560
me at the same temperature which i think

306
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,479
i clearly demonstrated to you before

307
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,159
not all organisms grow on the same

308
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,320
carbon source

309
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,439
and not all organisms grow at the same

310
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
rate

311
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,519
and these three things are very

312
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,720
important when you're dealing with

313
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,959
plating

314
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,639
and this is not something that we have

315
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,838
when we're testing with molecular

316
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,039
methods

317
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,519
now it's very interesting

318
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,559
remediation practices are becoming more

319
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,959
common

320
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,679
and i think a lot of what may be

321
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,039
happening here and this is hypothesis

322
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,958
and this is something that i want to

323
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,719
investigate further and maybe i can

324
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,399
present to you guys next year on my

325
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,920
findings

326
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,278
but i think a lot of what may be

327
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,360
happening here is this viable but

328
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:37,039
non-culturable event and what happens is

329
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
is that some of these remediation

330
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:43,120
techniques involve sterilization whether

331
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,959
you're using ozone gamma radiation x-ray

332
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,639
radiation what whatever hydrogen

333
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,278
peroxide treatment

334
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,360
and they're knocking

335
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,639
the cell they're knocking the organisms

336
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,639
down

337
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,440
but it's kind of like a boxing match as

338
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,720
i'll use exact terminology here

339
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,240
they're knocking them down but they're

340
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
not going to not knocking them down for

341
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,320
the count they're down

342
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
at the eight count they're kind of snap

343
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,600
staggering back to life

344
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,439
and then

345
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,920
they'll start growing again and that

346
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,720
could be why on some of these plates

347
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,199
at 24 hours it's just not enough but if

348
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,639
you give it a few more days they start

349
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,120
reviving

350
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,399
and and this makes sense i mean you kind

351
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,399
of see it

352
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,440
in food right you go to the grocery

353
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,000
store you buy a pack of strawberries

354
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
they look fine you bring them home you

355
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,480
stick them in the refrigerator two days

356
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,440
later you gotta eat them and you're like

357
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,278
oh [ __ ] they're all moldy

358
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,160
same thing could be happening

359
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,639
so just because a sample

360
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,240
leaves the lab on day one and passes

361
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,720
microbial doesn't mean it's going to go

362
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,480
sit on a shelf in a dispensary and not

363
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,079
still continue to grow the mold or

364
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,600
bacteria

365
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,799
so this is something that's really

366
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,399
interesting i think it's something

367
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,679
that's important and the whole point of

368
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,679
it is is that qpcr or molecular methods

369
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,278
are gonna pick up these

370
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,519
viable but non-culturable and so

371
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,120
we may be seeing well how come if i use

372
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,360
qpcr

373
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,560
i have you know i'm failing my product

374
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
but i played it and there's nothing

375
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,759
there i believe that it's this viable

376
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,559
but non-cultural event that's happening

377
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,360
so

378
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,078
am i really that early

379
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,240
i think i've made a ton all right so

380
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,359
this is our team staff i want to thank

381
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,079
these people

382
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,480
um you know we're always

383
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,278
looking for things to test and and this

384
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,399
whole plating vs qpcr or molecular

385
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,720
methods

386
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,799
isn't going away and i will continue to

387
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,720
come here and educate all you all you

388
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:44,519
all so if anyone has any questions i'd

389
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,519
be happy to answer them

390
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,399
[Applause]

391
