1
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:14,928
hi everybody thank you for everybody

2
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:23,000
that stay and survive to be here with me

3
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:24,919
and so if somebody don't know me I'm my

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,778
name is the dead Amerian professor in

5
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:29,929
the Technion which is the Technology

6
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:31,699
Institute of Israel similar to the MIT

7
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,420
something like that we don't have

8
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:39,409
literature we have just accurate science

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:43,490
and a few years ago around three years

10
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:46,909
ago so four years ago I got my own lab

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,800
in the Technion doing a cancer biology

12
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,679
but my background I have a master's in

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:56,390
biochemistry PhD in plant molecular

14
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:59,119
biology and postdoc in cancer biology

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,329
when I came back to Israel and I got my

16
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:05,478
own lab to do cancer biology I look how

17
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:07,640
to bring plant back to my research

18
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:10,489
because I thought it will give advantage

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,269
and then I started to do cancer biology

20
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:19,039
but from then my lab spread to do a lot

21
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:21,649
of cannabis research so today from 45

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,450
people in my lab a team 42 is working on

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,700
cannabis 3 is not working in canvas

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,530
because if somebody asking me if I'm

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,939
doing just cannabis I have excuse to say

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:36,740
no so I'm just talking because it's not

27
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:42,039
moving that's all hey I want two minutes

28
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:47,118
spare after that it's not working guys

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,530
no just a moment oh it's upside down

30
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,870
okay

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,519
so I want to speak today a little bit

32
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,670
about the in terrassa fact and what I

33
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:58,728
think about it people think that we need

34
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,310
all the plant other people's think that

35
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:04,039
one molecule synthesize can do the same

36
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,379
effect and more accurate and I think

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,530
it's somewhere in between and I want to

38
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:12,500
talk about it and to show one example

39
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:19,759
from my lab that fit to my philosophy

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:21,830
that 50% is right and 50% is wrong so we

41
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,469
have the enter the endocannabinoid

42
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,890
system in our body that cannabis is

43
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,989
influenced mostly through that system I

44
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:32,409
won't talk about it too much because I

45
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:36,770
guess most of the people know but our

46
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:39,829
body built from cells and the biology

47
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:43,150
teacher in grade 5 showed the cells like

48
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:47,270
that but usually it look like that and

49
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:50,270
cell is the basic unit which call it

50
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:54,610
life so it's the basic units of all the

51
00:02:50,270 --> 00:03:00,140
live creatures but even though it can be

52
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,940
itself and can be an own entity that the

53
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:04,729
lives of these are cells that crawling

54
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:08,810
on the plate and web creatures that are

55
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:12,679
one cell like yeast or bacteria in our

56
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,349
body cells organizing tissues and they

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,239
need to communicate very well so when

58
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm moving my hand the cell from my

59
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,239
brain sends signal to selling my my

60
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,150
muscles to contract and they must be

61
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,420
very coordinated with other cells in

62
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,599
order to have this contraction so then

63
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:35,238
cells in our body need to communicate

64
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,669
between themselves very tightly and very

65
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,579
organized and then doing it by sunny

66
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:43,518
sending messages to each other so these

67
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,409
are two cells at sending messages so one

68
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,510
cells send message and the other one

69
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:49,969
need to read it and the way they are

70
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:52,879
doing it we have messengers and we have

71
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:54,590
receptors that know how to read it in

72
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,139
the endocannabinoid system the

73
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,420
messengers are the endocannabinoids or

74
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,879
the cannabinoids and the receptors of

75
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:04,579
the receptors on the end

76
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,710
the cannabinoid system so the

77
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:10,640
endocannabinoid system usually we

78
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:13,159
mentioned two receptor cb1 and cb2 and i

79
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:18,430
saw in the last two days at least five

80
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:21,709
times this figure and i think except a

81
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,259
except few times people didn't mention

82
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,840
that there are many other receptors so

83
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:29,959
there is GP r 55 GP r 18 and many

84
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,209
receptors I'm familiar with 32 receptors

85
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,569
of the endocannabinoid system and I'm

86
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:37,879
familiar with 30 there it's probably 50

87
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:40,790
also about the endocannabinoid usually

88
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,060
mean we mentioned ananda my day to AG

89
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,129
but there are more than 100

90
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,920
endocannabinoids my lab today have the

91
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:51,439
ability to analyze more than 120

92
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,860
different endocannabinoid so in the

93
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,980
blood so with a lot of messengers in a

94
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:02,360
lot of way to read them and this create

95
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:05,920
a complicated system cannabis affect the

96
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,740
system through the cannabinoids that is

97
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,020
creating so we have in the plant that

98
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,370
this unique plant the ability to create

99
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:18,919
a structure that is similar to the

100
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,560
structure that our body creating and

101
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,060
binding the same receptors but again in

102
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,990
the cannabis we don't have tea it's in

103
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:30,530
CBD web at least 10 families of

104
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:34,340
cannabinoids and altogether I know today

105
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:37,279
to analyze from the plant 144 different

106
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:39,319
feet of cannabinoids and these Fito

107
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,019
cannabinoids is actually and we also

108
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,480
have the tippin's I will skip it and we

109
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:47,750
have a lot of chemo vows in my lab I

110
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,879
have over than 650 different cameras it

111
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,670
each one of them will have different

112
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,939
profile of cannabinoids and this

113
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,530
cannabinoids is binding these

114
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:00,639
endocannabinoid system and actually

115
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:04,969
doing a bypass instead of getting very

116
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:08,479
accurate message to our body doing it

117
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:12,020
very very accurately when we move near a

118
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,930
barbecue and we smell the barbecue sauce

119
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:16,508
small molecules from the barbecue

120
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,509
is entering to our nose going to our

121
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,870
olfactory system that signaling to the

122
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,069
neurons to create a specific

123
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,259
endocannabinoid that will bind a

124
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:29,199
specific receptors that create appetite

125
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:33,069
but when we smoking cannabis with

126
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,949
floating this with a lot of compounds at

127
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:41,050
binding different receptors and grating

128
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:43,830
a complicate reaction so when we are

129
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,650
talking about the in terrassa fact

130
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:51,788
usually at least what I'm hearing from

131
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:54,269
people and if you read the papers the

132
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:56,620
first paper that published by a

133
00:06:54,269 --> 00:07:00,008
professor Ben Shabbat and professor a

134
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,459
famous ulam the idea is that one

135
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:06,610
compound is not enough to give the

136
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:08,228
signal to the receptors so one compound

137
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,840
is not strong enough but if they are

138
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:13,418
coming as a group they can activate the

139
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:17,348
receptors so this is the entrez effect

140
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:19,060
the pimalia effect the familia effect so

141
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:20,860
usually when I'm giving these talks in

142
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,360
Israel said it's like you're going in

143
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,250
the beach and some kind of a guy

144
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,129
starting it coming and pushing you

145
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,959
usually feel unease can do anything but

146
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:32,829
if he's coming with his familia effect

147
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,839
then you're in a big problem so it's

148
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:38,430
nice story but it's not working like

149
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,209
that in biology because this is backward

150
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:44,709
just a moment

151
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:48,399
okay because in biology usually the lie

152
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:51,810
again the message should fit to the

153
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,638
receptors we call it a lock and key

154
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,519
principle it doesn't matter if you're

155
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,610
coming with a lot of kids you need one

156
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:03,038
to fit today to the receptors in order

157
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,169
to open a tune to activate it so it's

158
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:08,288
not fit to the theory that you need a

159
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:11,529
lot in order to push it at least usually

160
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:14,110
this not the way it works so why we have

161
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:17,679
the enter effect again because we have

162
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:21,639
many receptors and many signals that

163
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,639
coming together operating many signals

164
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,620
in the in the cells and we're getting a

165
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:30,379
complicate reaction so

166
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,659
and prove it so this is the so if you

167
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:37,970
thought that this is complicated this is

168
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:41,120
the real picture part of that so going

169
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:43,879
back to my lab when we started to do

170
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,310
cancer research we do few different

171
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:50,269
types of cannabis and few different

172
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:52,849
cells cancer cells and we try to see how

173
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:55,490
its affect the cells we read the papers

174
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,860
by Manuel Guzman and Kristine Sanchez

175
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,899
that's sitting here and so in breast

176
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,120
cancer in glioblastoma that cannabis can

177
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:04,490
create apoptosis can kill the cells I

178
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:09,590
must say that this clock is killing me

179
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:11,570
it's like bombed that going down I don't

180
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:18,379
care about the organiser no way that I'm

181
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:21,760
finishing nine minutes so now I was

182
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:24,409
kidding I was kidding I'm on time guys I

183
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:29,120
was in our in the army you know time is

184
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:32,269
time so there isn't penalty not staying

185
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,149
or not paying it standing in time so we

186
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:37,759
grind the cells in a play so these are

187
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:39,829
cells very low magnification every dot

188
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,439
there is a cell these are colon cancer

189
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,389
cells and we create an extract that was

190
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,760
a plant biologist I know how to do

191
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:49,939
ethanol extraction we create an extract

192
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,220
and we put very low amount on these

193
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,220
cells and surprisingly they were all

194
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,990
dead we put extract number two and they

195
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,570
were all dead we put extra number three

196
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,399
and it didn't affect the cells so we saw

197
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,770
a specificity between the types of the

198
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,470
cannabis since affecting this colon

199
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:09,259
cancer we did that breast cancer was so

200
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,269
very similar phenomena but when we do

201
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:13,549
did a prostate cancer they extracted

202
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:17,689
kill the breast cancer and the colon

203
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:19,549
didn't affect the the prostate cancer

204
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,920
the same thing with extract number two

205
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:23,659
but extract number three that didn't

206
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,509
kill the colon and didn't kill the

207
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:29,809
breast kill the prostate cancer when we

208
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:32,720
use colon cells without cancer mutation

209
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:35,479
it didn't affect them as it affect these

210
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,100
types of cancer so this is one way to do

211
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,350
it in order to take it to the next step

212
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,560
we said okay we don't know what is

213
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,940
affecting them

214
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,859
we can do it in high-throughput

215
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,230
screening so we can grow the cells in

216
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,840
plate like that but we also can grow

217
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,028
them in play that have many holes and we

218
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,420
can use equipment that can read in

219
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:57,240
heavy-haul can take images from every

220
00:10:54,419 --> 00:11:01,110
hole so this machine is incubator that

221
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:04,589
cell can grow live in it but also can

222
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:07,110
take a lot of images so this is how

223
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:09,420
we're doing it we can put markers on

224
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,210
that so every time that the cell print

225
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:15,120
look red it's dying and every time that

226
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:18,930
is blue Israel alive so you can see that

227
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,320
on top there is a control cell that that

228
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:24,449
dying cells that are alive and what I

229
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,940
want to show you here is these are

230
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,370
melanoma cells is very similar to what I

231
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,400
showed you before you can see that there

232
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,929
are every color it's a different game of

233
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,730
our different strains of cannabis and

234
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:38,370
you see that there is bunch of cells

235
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,560
that bunch of extracts that not

236
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,320
affecting the cells bunch of them that

237
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,879
killing 50% a bunch of them are very

238
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:50,250
effective but when we try to align them

239
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,689
according the T it's in the CBD amount

240
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,789
we saw that there is no correlation

241
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,490
about the amount of the T it's in CBD

242
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:58,049
and the ability to kill the cells so now

243
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,909
we're doing another trick we're taking

244
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:05,539
these one-one types of Kim over one

245
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:08,879
types of strain and we're extracting

246
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:11,459
just the THC in the CBD and we put

247
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,610
purified it's in CBD from these strains

248
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,700
on the cells and even if we put 20 times

249
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,710
higher it's not affecting the cells so

250
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,770
what I learned from this that it's not

251
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:25,110
that it CBD alone or it's not them at

252
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:28,769
all but at least it's not that it's in

253
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:31,620
the CBD alone so if to complicate that

254
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:34,439
even if we take the same types of cancer

255
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,778
these are colon cancer and you see on

256
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,420
the upper type of the colon cancer there

257
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,730
are few strains that are very effective

258
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:45,120
killing that but on the lower one even

259
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,129
have tried 650 different strain none of

260
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,950
them affected and it's the same thing

261
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:52,320
with prostate cancer so there is even in

262
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,570
the subtypes of the cancer there are

263
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,180
differences

264
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,790
so how can you look on it we said okay

265
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:02,778
let's look even more narrow let's look

266
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:05,689
on cells with one types of cancer and

267
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:08,778
one type of mutation that caused it to

268
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,639
be cancer we call it driving mutation so

269
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:13,100
I won't go the details because I don't

270
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,440
have time but the idea is blue is

271
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,120
without mutation this become more and

272
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,029
more severe that the yellow it's more

273
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,370
severe so we starting starting to check

274
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:24,049
and every bulk like that it's a

275
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,240
different strain so you see that this

276
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:29,479
one didn't affect the cells and these

277
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,879
strains kill the cells in correlation to

278
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,129
the mutation when we find it something

279
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,500
like that we going deeper and deeper and

280
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:39,889
because I don't have in time I have four

281
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,970
minutes 55 seconds who can't who counts

282
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:46,100
I will I will skip and I we said we

283
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,040
going and looking deeper and deeper and

284
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,159
we prove ourself that what we see is

285
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,078
right we're doing a rescue we bring back

286
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,689
the protein without the mutation we

287
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,028
check different strains that look very

288
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,069
similar to the strain we suggest this

289
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:02,899
strain is very specific we're going

290
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:05,870
forward and forward then we're going to

291
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:08,120
a mice model and we check in mice model

292
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,669
and we see that this strain is also

293
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,100
decrease the size of the two more it's

294
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:16,519
very effective when we're doing that now

295
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:20,569
I'm asking myself do I need the whole

296
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:23,328
extract or do I need single compound so

297
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,919
my lab have the ability to read all the

298
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:27,019
compounds in the cannabis it's very

299
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,568
complicated in this train there is

300
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,659
around 100 different compounds

301
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:34,338
cannabinoid twopence flavonoids so what

302
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:37,068
we are doing we are running it on

303
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:41,089
equipment and we are fractionated we

304
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:44,240
said let's put 25 compounds in the first

305
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:46,339
tube 25 other compounds the second

306
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,709
you'll be fractionated and we're going

307
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,829
back to the cell oh the demise and we

308
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:54,049
check it and we see in that case the

309
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:56,179
just one fraction every color is a

310
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:59,269
different fraction and the red one is

311
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:01,549
the whole extract so we saw that we have

312
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:04,220
a lackey and just one fraction is

313
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:07,759
working as the whole plant so we

314
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,610
eliminate 75% of the old

315
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,129
compounds and we're going another step

316
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,740
forward said okay fraction two was the

317
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:18,259
one that walked now is left with twenty

318
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,539
five compound that fraction them now two

319
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:23,149
five five five and five and we're going

320
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:25,579
on and on until we find the minimum

321
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:27,470
compound they doing the maximum effect

322
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,350
this is my slogan to the students I

323
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:33,019
don't care if it's one seven twenty or

324
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,659
all of them I want to know what is the

325
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,230
minimum compound the doing the maximum

326
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:40,909
effect

327
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:46,700
three minutes thank you I don't see it

328
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:51,409
at all like okay so in that case in that

329
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:54,320
case we find out that we need three

330
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:55,990
compounds in order to get the full

331
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,580
effect

332
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,919
just three compounds if you take one of

333
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,560
them out it's not working anymore

334
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:06,169
but if you have the three of them you

335
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:09,379
get aligned exactly like the whole

336
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:12,500
extract so for me this is a proof of

337
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:15,320
concept of the inter effect it's not one

338
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,590
compound it's not the whole extract it's

339
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,070
few compounds that activating different

340
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:24,019
pathway that creating this effect one of

341
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,790
these three compound it's even unknown

342
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:28,549
don't have a name we call it three three

343
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:32,839
one be you know my chemist analysis are

344
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:36,019
very creative so one of them is even

345
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:39,290
unknown it's not a minor it's almost one

346
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:41,600
percent in this extract but it's unknown

347
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:44,110
nobody looking on that and if you're

348
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,600
taking out you won't get this effect so

349
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:50,480
if I'm looking on that even deeper we

350
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,570
saw we know all the password whites

351
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,460
degra dead bees active proteins whites

352
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,330
sending it to the gradation one day

353
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,670
cells dying

354
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:02,330
and one of the reason is because you get

355
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:05,359
a flux of calcium in the cell so you see

356
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:08,959
this is the whole extract we could get

357
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,939
flux of calcium so we checked the

358
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,560
receptors there is seven receptors on

359
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,769
these cells from the endocannabinoid

360
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,789
system we suspect that one of them trpv1

361
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:20,759
is responsible to these flux so we block

362
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,209
the tear

363
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:28,289
pv-1 and we block just half of the flux

364
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:30,390
and again if you look on the cells when

365
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:34,139
we're blocking this is the whole extract

366
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:37,820
this is blocking trpv1 we block just

367
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:40,590
killing part of them one minute so

368
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:43,740
actually this for me it's like proof of

369
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:46,289
koskoff concept one compound and we

370
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,279
already know which one is binding trpv1

371
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:52,349
and starting a flux of calcium the other

372
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:56,450
one binding different receptors and

373
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:59,189
altogether you get enough power enough

374
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:02,460
things that happen in the cells that

375
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:05,430
killing these cells this is how I see it

376
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,100
operate and this is what my vision to

377
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,650
the next year that we find define which

378
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:12,929
compound is doing what how the binding

379
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:16,769
which receptor they're binding and are

380
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:19,440
we getting this effect so just say thank

381
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:25,049
you to my okay and this is what I just

382
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:27,600
said 30 minutes 12 10 so just saying

383
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:30,419
thank you to this amazing group that

384
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,219
walking with me this is my lab so this

385
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,519
is shirley berman that did all the

386
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,069
cannabis analyzing this is liran boron

387
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,549
dr. Elaine brown they did all the cancer

388
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:42,059
research

389
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:45,649
this is dr. Gil Leavitt us they did the

390
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,649
mice work thank you very much
