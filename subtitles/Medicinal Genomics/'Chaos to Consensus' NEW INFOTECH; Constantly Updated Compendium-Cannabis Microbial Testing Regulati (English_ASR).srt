1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,240
first of all I'd like to thank the can

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
Med

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,679
advisory panel to give me this

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,460
opportunity to share our study

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,519
so first of all I'd like to to share

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,400
what was the purpose of this study

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:27,359
to understand the status of cannabis

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:30,000
microbial testing regulations in all U.S

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,000
states and territories then second

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,600
to identify Trends in microbial testing

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,299
rules since 2019 and to identify a

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,340
consensus set of required microbial

13
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,939
testing rules to lower public health

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,940
risks

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,079
now everyone knows what the federal

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,260
perspective of cannabis is but there are

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,320
individuals from other countries first

18
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,238
the use sale and possessions is illegal

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,579
under federal law

20
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,820
is considered a schedule one drug under

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,180
the federal controlled substance Act

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,478
and also and schedule one drugs are

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,659
considered to have no accepted Medical

24
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:16,859
use a high potential for abuse and

25
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,979
physical and or psychological dependence

26
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:24,978
so where is cannabis legal in the United

27
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:29,579
States and this is as of January 2023 so

28
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:32,400
highlighted in Gold 21 states and two

29
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:36,140
territories have both

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,540
legal adult use and medical cannabis

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:42,840
programs highlighted in green There are

32
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,479
16 states that have medical cannabis

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,000
only that also that would be two

34
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,739
additional territories so the total

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,780
number of jurisdictions the United

36
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,780
States is 42.

37
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:02,399
this slide shows the methods of our

38
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,978
study first we reviewed all the current

39
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,459
Cannabis Testing rules

40
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:11,289
then we updated our microbial testing

41
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,539
regulations for each jurisdiction

42
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:15,780
[Music]

43
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,699
and the two full size we had was

44
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,739
required microbial tests for each

45
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:22,979
jurisdiction and the corresponding

46
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:25,140
Action level for each test for each

47
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:26,899
product type and there's four product

48
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:30,419
types flower

49
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,180
concentrates Edibles and non-edibles and

50
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:36,479
the web link where you can find all this

51
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,120
information updated to the present is

52
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,539
shown in the slide

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,819
so from this data set we determine for

54
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,979
each test the number of jurisdiction

55
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,919
requiring each test

56
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:52,500
the number of each Action level for each

57
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,199
test and the number of unique microbial

58
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,659
test combinations for flour and edibles

59
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,419
but this afternoon I'll only be showing

60
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:04,739
you the data for the flower testing

61
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:09,359
then we perform two sets of comparative

62
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:12,000
analysis first within the 2023 data sets

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,019
for testing flour and edibles

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,699
and also what or on a comparative

65
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:24,300
analysis between a 2019 database and in

66
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:26,639
our present 2023 database to see the

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,280
direction of where microbial testing is

68
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,878
occurring in the United States

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
so here are some general observations

70
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:37,560
concerning the required microbial

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,319
testing regulations in the U.S

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,199
the bottom line is it's a mess

73
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,818
there's 22 different microbial tests

74
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,378
that are required by at least one

75
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:49,259
jurisdiction

76
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,818
and they fall into three categories the

77
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,340
first category is

78
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:56,759
is total count tests there's six of them

79
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:00,420
and I have four examples total aerobic

80
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,878
bacteria total yeast and molds total

81
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,798
coliforms and total biotolerant

82
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,579
gram-negative bacteria

83
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,700
and then there are four

84
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:15,540
tests where specific genuses any species

85
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,939
so these first two types of tests I'm

86
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:22,319
not a proponent of requiring this

87
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:25,259
testing because an enumeration of these

88
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,459
two kinds of tests provides me with no

89
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,080
information

90
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:32,698
whether there's any pathogenic

91
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,599
microorganisms in my sample and I might

92
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:39,360
get a fail a failure in my sample then

93
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,120
the last type are these there's 12

94
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,439
specific genus species tests

95
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,478
in

96
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,219
in the literature in the clinical

97
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,379
literature

98
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,800
I have

99
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:55,560
five five examples here we have the four

100
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,319
pathogenic aspergillus species that's

101
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,879
aspergillus flavus fumigatus Niger

102
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,199
antarius

103
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:06,478
and sugar toxin producing E coli one of

104
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,400
six pathotypes where this one is the

105
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,918
most pathogenic

106
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,379
now interestingly of all the

107
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:17,418
jurisdictions the number of microbial

108
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:19,978
tests required was a wide range

109
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:21,299
Winter's fiction has just one test

110
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:25,079
required

111
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,199
in a few States as many as 10 tests

112
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,000
so an example of the sole state in the

113
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,660
United States that only requires one

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
state is total I mean is Arkansas is the

115
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,400
absence of total coliforms but anyone

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,279
can Google this and not all colon forms

117
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:45,179
of pathogenic so you might

118
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:48,418
get a film but are there any pathogenic

119
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,360
coliforms in the sample I don't know and

120
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:54,000
then Connecticut is over the top where

121
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,520
they have the six specific pathogens

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,819
that have described including also

123
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:01,079
salmonella species but also four total

124
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,538
count tests

125
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,478
now the action there's no consensus is

126
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:09,360
even in the action thresholds and the

127
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:12,120
widest range for the total count tests

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,419
is the total Eastern mold

129
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,340
on the low end is it's three orders of

130
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:19,379
magnitude and the low ends the thousand

131
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,138
colony forming units

132
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,418
program of sample and on the high end is

133
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:27,780
10 to the fifth

134
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:32,060
and for all the genus and the genus

135
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,059
species test it's always non-detect

136
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,900
now this slide describes the status of

137
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,300
the microbial testing rules for flowers

138
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:45,779
in the start of this year so if you

139
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,879
focus on the second row I've already

140
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,818
mentioned the 42 jurisdictions have

141
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,439
legal programs but three of the

142
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,300
jurisdictions being three of the

143
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,259
territories have no testing rules to

144
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,680
date

145
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,538
now there's actually 41 sets of

146
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,579
microbial testing rules because two

147
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:04,740
states Arizona and New York have

148
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:08,399
separate testing rules

149
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,699
for adults and medical use

150
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:15,538
so what we have is 13 of these states

151
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,160
share three common testing rule sets we

152
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:19,318
have what's commonly known as the

153
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,439
California model which are the six

154
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:25,020
pathogens that salmonella species sugar

155
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,538
toxin producing E coli and the four

156
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,418
pathogenic aspergillus species

157
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:31,318
three states have tacked on tourist and

158
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:35,339
mold

159
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:38,160
and then Six States still utilize the

160
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,459
archaic American herbal pharmacopoeia

161
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,060
model that came out in 2014

162
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:46,500
which are four total count tests a total

163
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,478
aerobic

164
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,660
touriston Mall total coliforms

165
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:54,019
biotolerant gremnig the bacteria and one

166
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,880
nonsensical rule

167
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:59,698
pathogenic E coli

168
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,098
please correct me if I'm wrong but I

169
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,639
have not ever found a single test

170
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:09,300
utilizing any technology that can detect

171
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:13,139
all six pathotypes of E coli

172
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,120
and so I've asked lab directors what do

173
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,840
you do oh we test for sugar toxin

174
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,560
producing E coli that's what they do

175
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,619
um

176
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,199
so what we have the bottom line is shown

177
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,560
in the lower right

178
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:33,360
is that there's some chaos here still

179
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,940
there's 29 unique test combinations in

180
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,918
the United States and so there's still

181
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,620
quite a bit of Chaos

182
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,500
now what we have is I'd like to share

183
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,679
with you the trends over the last three

184
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,740
years in terms of the total count tests

185
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:52,019
and the specific human pathogens and

186
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,419
this slide is the total count test and

187
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,879
the bottom line is that there's a trend

188
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:00,539
towards decrease in the fraction of the

189
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,700
jurisdictions asking for this test so

190
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,740
the top line is the total aerobic

191
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,200
bacteria and total microbial count

192
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,080
whereby

193
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,240
over the three-year period it has the

194
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,600
fraction of jurisdictions has decreased

195
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,139
from 67 percent to 44 percent and that

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,240
being a change of 23 percent the total

197
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,819
Eastern mold they're hanging on for dear

198
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,419
life

199
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:30,180
whereby it's decreased from 74 to 63 a

200
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:32,458
decrease in 11 and then the third line

201
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:35,159
total coliforms they're hanging on to

202
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:38,699
that one too but it's a lower percentage

203
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:41,639
of the fraction as of 2023 and it's 37

204
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,860
percent a decrease in four percent and

205
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,639
the ball tolerant gram-negative bacteria

206
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,500
have decreased the most down to 32

207
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,720
percent of the jurisdictions was a

208
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,240
decrease of almost 40 percent

209
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,560
now what we have now is the specific

210
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,919
pathogen test and where this shows

211
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,500
a trending in in my mind the correct

212
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,439
direction towards consensus as a

213
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,139
beginning point so we have salmonella

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,120
species so it's already 85 percent but

215
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,958
additional states have seen the light

216
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:19,799
and now all jurisdictions except two

217
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:22,979
require salmonella testing

218
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:25,620
and then for the pathogenic E coli that

219
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,100
nonsensical rule

220
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:32,480
has now decreased to 27 percent of the

221
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,860
jurisdictions a decrease in 17 percent

222
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,000
and this is the indication that

223
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,820
Regulators are being educated that this

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,320
is the rule that can't be met

225
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,399
and so until a method developer develops

226
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,540
a test

227
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:54,539
that can detect all six pathotypes

228
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,519
I feel that the most pathogenic one

229
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,799
should be tested for that being sugar

230
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,679
toxin producing E coli and there has

231
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,539
been a dramatic increase to 44 percent

232
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,359
of the jurisdictions which was an

233
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:10,319
increase in 29 percent and sorry for the

234
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,839
typo on the aspergillus pathogens have

235
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,620
increased also dramatically

236
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,899
uh to over half 56 percent of the

237
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:24,139
jurisdictions an increase of 26 percent

238
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:29,639
and I have collected 23 clinical case

239
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:32,220
publications of individuals uh acquiring

240
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:35,720
or becoming sick with aspergillosis

241
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,720
affiliated with cannabis use

242
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,778
so yeah I have a very short talk

243
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:46,259
so where might we go from here

244
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:48,778
the six specific pathogens that are

245
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,480
required in the California model are not

246
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:54,600
all the human pathogens in cannabis

247
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,839
flowers I'll be the first to admit that

248
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,980
so how do we identify these additional

249
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,980
human pathogens

250
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,360
which would lead to a possible creation

251
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,040
of a consensus set of microbial testing

252
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,560
rules

253
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,360
to be considered by the by the federal

254
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,799
government

255
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,800
and so This research study is a massive

256
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,139
study it's more in my brain

257
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:25,559
so this would be a national cannabis

258
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:27,600
flower microbiome study so every legal

259
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:30,679
jurisdiction

260
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,899
that has legal cannabis one would

261
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:36,239
determine a statistically significant

262
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,059
number of cannabis flowers which is a

263
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,759
minimum of 400

264
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,619
then they would be sampled in the

265
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,200
different regions of the jurisdiction

266
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,659
noting

267
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,720
what type of cultivation was used

268
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:55,078
outdoor indoor Hydroponics or forth and

269
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,899
so on and the actual technology has

270
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:02,578
already been developed so one does a

271
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:04,440
direct DNA extraction from the flower

272
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:07,319
the second step

273
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,260
is the amplification of that DNA for

274
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,399
both the bacteria the yeast and the

275
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,559
fungi

276
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,159
so the sequences that you amplify for

277
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,979
the bacteria are the 16s ribosomal genes

278
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:22,860
and for the yeast and molds it's called

279
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,459
the its sequences

280
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:30,060
so one has all this DNA now that you've

281
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:34,099
Amplified and then you do sequencing of

282
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:37,859
this DNA and there's now nanopore

283
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,379
technology developed by Oxford uh the

284
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,320
Oxford technology company where the

285
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:46,439
sequencer is a little bit bigger than a

286
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,360
than a flash drive and the computer is

287
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,760
quite little and you can buy one and

288
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,720
play with it for six thousand dollars

289
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:57,179
and then you have to contract or have

290
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
in-house about informatics expert and

291
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,599
believe it or not we've already done

292
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,659
this at mgc

293
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,320
is that you can identify every genus and

294
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:10,078
species in that cannabis flower

295
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,500
and also you can

296
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:16,078
determine the relative amount so now you

297
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,458
have all this massive information

298
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,919
it's a lot

299
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:22,078
so what do you do with it and I don't

300
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,419
have the full answer of the composition

301
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,799
of the stakeholders group

302
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:27,599
I don't

303
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,639
but I know that we need infectious

304
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,860
disease doctors they know we need to

305
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,980
have clinical microbiologists

306
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,339
and also a clinical I mean risk

307
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,920
assessment experts just because you have

308
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:43,260
a human pathogen and cannabis flowers if

309
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,078
it's at a super low amount

310
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:49,198
does not necessarily mean that you have

311
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,819
to add it to the list but if you find or

312
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,519
identify

313
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,699
human pathogens at high levels in this

314
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,440
in a number of flowers throughout the

315
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,278
country then you want to keep it in the

316
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,800
list

317
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,439
and then literature search experts are

318
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:08,819
very very important because they can do

319
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,220
massive literature searches to see what

320
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,760
are the

321
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:16,379
microbial species that are

322
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,019
human pathogens which ones are

323
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:22,078
opportunistic pathogens and so forth and

324
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:24,778
so on and then through just dialogue

325
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,838
they identify identification of

326
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:31,139
additional subject matter experts that

327
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,399
could be included in this dialogue and

328
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:37,740
from all this big data set one can then

329
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,620
determine a consensus set for microbial

330
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,659
testing rules for a state for a region

331
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,278
of the United States or the whole

332
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:45,899
country I don't know how this is going

333
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:50,338
to come out

334
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:53,698
um and I hope to see I'm sharing this

335
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:56,339
slide simply to plant the seed for

336
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:59,179
people to consider from now into the

337
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:02,880
future and hopefully the study will be

338
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:04,799
conducted in a stepwise manner until we

339

who updated the database and created all

345
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,860
the data sets and summer Hall helped me

346
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,219
visualize some of the data in this last

347
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,220
slide

348
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:35,338

and I kept my talk short

354
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,198
hi Sherman

355
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,659
um Hey Joe I I never dreamed anyone can

356
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,359
make a talk about regulations so

357
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:02,939
exciting it was really great

358
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,439
um I wanted to ask you

359
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,380
um I've talked to a couple of people

360
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:11,640
with history working in the USDA

361
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:15,299
and they have told me about a lot of

362
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,900
you know uh I guess uh institutional

363
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:20,459
knowledge about agricultural pathogens

364
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,980
um our

365
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,699
is there still information that's kind

366
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,558
of

367
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,419
um known from other crops that we're

368
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,220
missing here that we could use to kind

369
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,600
of have a better guess of what what to

370
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,400
look for

371
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,459
well the thing is that you mentioned the

372
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,280
USDA and

373
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,220
you know I I worked in public health and

374
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,619
in environmental chemistry and in our

375
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,880
laboratory in New Jersey we had some

376
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:48,599
interaction

377
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,820
uh with the Department of Agriculture

378
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,558
um and again that's thank you very much

379
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:56,038
for pointing that out to me I really

380
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,918
have not had the opportunity to ask them

381
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:04,619
in terms of I know that they focus on

382
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:06,360
the on the plant pathogens but with all

383
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:07,859
the information and all the experience

384
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,139
they've had I'm sure they've identified

385
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:12,178
some human pathogens so I think it would

386
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,759
be a good source

387
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:17,720
of information yeah like you should look

388
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:20,519
into like Berry sorter's lung and Rose

389
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,600
Grower's thumb there are a bunch of them

390
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,599
that are known especially from

391
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,639
agricultural occupation

392
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:29,099
um and uh there is quite a lot of

393
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,038
information out there right okay we'll

394
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:35,058
talk about that thank you

395
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,058
