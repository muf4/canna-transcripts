VIP dinner on this episode we talk with

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,359
Brianna Cassidy who is the chief

26
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:23,539
scientific officer at CDX

27
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,150
analytics Brianna and the team at CVX

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,460
performed safety testing on all types of

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,280
cannabis samples including potency

30
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:33,679
pesticides heavy metals residual

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,840
solvents and microbial contamination as

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,150
you will hear from our conversation

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,490
brianna takes a creative and analytical

34
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,370
approach to solving problems that come

35
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:46,129
with testing cannabis products at cam at

36
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,530
2020 Brianna will share her process for

37
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:51,319
evaluating new analytical methods and

38
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,790
technologies for her lap as you can

39
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,769
imagine there are a number of vendors

40
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,990
looking to install their systems and

41
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:59,509
cannabis testing labs so it helps to

42
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:02,419
have a thorough and objective process to

43
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,640
choose the best option our team knows

44
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,250
firsthand that Brianna is thorough when

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,348
evaluating new technologies she and the

46
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,870
team at CVX provided data that was a

47
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:16,128
major part of the medicinal genomics

48
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,959
manufacturer validation document Brianna

49
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:19,818
and I also discussed the issue of

50
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,890
consistency when it comes to potency

51
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:24,169
testing I was surprised to learn that

52
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:27,359
cannabis flowers from the same batch are

53
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:30,059
often 50% more or less potent

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
than what's reported on the package she

55
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,009
also explained how water content can

56
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,599
make a big difference in potency results

57
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:39,449
we are excited to have Breanna as part

58
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,699

101
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,620
hey Brianna how are we doing today doing

102
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,650
pretty well van yourself I'm doing well

103
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:45,129
thank you so much for joining us on the

104
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:47,259
podcast and as I always like the same

105
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:50,079
when I talk to people from the lab

106
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,969
testing profession I love getting a

107
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,879
chance to talk to you because we at

108
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,790
medicinal genomics we work with you guys

109
00:04:53,879 --> 00:05:00,069
very closely and I know what you do on

110
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,510
the microbial side obviously because of

111
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,279
what we do at medicinal genomics but I

112
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,319
really like to talk to you about all the

113
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,629
other things that you test for at the

114
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:10,029
testing lab so tell me a little bit

115
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:13,389
about CDX your position there and what a

116
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:15,129
what a typical day is like sure first

117
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:18,220
off I'd like to say I'm honored to be a

118
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:20,759
part of the can med conference I'm very

119
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,280
excited to be presenting there so I'm

120
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:27,699
looking forward to that and my title is

121
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:31,629
the chief science officer at CDX

122
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:33,519
analytics and we test for a myriad of

123
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,728
different things in cannabis and

124
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,819
cannabis infused products of course the

125
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:42,610
cannabinoids the active ingredients

126
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:45,579
terpenes also possibly active

127
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,949
ingredients and then some contaminants

128
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:52,569
so we're looking at heavy metals

129
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:56,589
pesticides microbials mycotoxins and

130
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:59,529
then we have some disruptive technology

131
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:02,469
in the lab too in regard to our dry

132
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:07,599
weight measurement and accounting for

133
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:10,060
water content in samples Oh tell me a

134
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,580
bit more about that I had a feeling you

135
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:17,439
might ask you have good instincts yeah

136
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:21,550
it's it's important to talk about water

137
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:24,160
content because the reported

138
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,310
concentrations are supposed to be

139
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,760
indicative of how much what it is we're

140
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:34,449
seeing is in the dry weight of the

141
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:37,719
sample being tested and cannabis can be

142
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,839
around 80 percent water so if you don't

143
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,710
accurately account for that 80 percent

144
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,679
and subtract it out

145
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:47,750
the result from your very precise

146
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,459
analytical instrumentation could be

147
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,870
completely moot the suggested way to do

148
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:57,019
this by the American Herbal

149
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,590
pharmacopoeia is by loss on drying and

150
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:02,089
that's essentially taking the sample and

151
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:06,079
putting it in an oven for a certain

152
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:08,679
amount of time so that has some

153
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:12,379
implications that loss on drawing method

154
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:16,098
number one water desorption is a very

155
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:19,159
slow process and as you reach completion

156
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:20,930
it becomes slower and slower so if

157
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,259
you're to put a really wet sample in

158
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,639
alongside a very dry sample after the

159
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:30,020
same exposure to temperature and time

160
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,689
those two samples will still have

161
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:35,870
different water contents so the more wet

162
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:38,300
sample will still be wet and if you

163
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,180
don't account for all the water in a

164
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,060
sample you are going to artificially

165
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:48,050
deflate all of your analytical results

166
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:51,379
if you over account for water content by

167
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,870
possibly let's say baking off terpenes

168
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,930
and other volatile parts of your sample

169
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,300
assuming they're water but they're not

170
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:03,680
then you can artificially inflate your

171
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,240
analytical results so what we've done is

172
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,610
we've incorporated a technique other

173
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,098
than loss on drying we're using gas

174
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,220
phase Karl Fischer titration and what

175
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:16,759
this does is using a sub sample of what

176
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,849
we're testing we can figure out how much

177
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:22,270
reaction we get with the water content

178
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:25,610
in that sample using a chemical test and

179
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:28,370
simply subtract the water content out

180
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,129
using the molecular weight at the end so

181
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,788
this allows for an extremely precise and

182
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:38,360
accurate result for all of our testing

183
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:41,629
that we do on flour okay

184
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,700
so so if I follow that if I follow that

185
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:44,778
and I'm not sure that I did but that's

186
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,000
okay

187
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:49,159
so what you're doing is actually just

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,190
measuring the water content and then

189
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:54,588
kind of subtracting that out or applying

190
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,030
some kind of algorithm to separate that

191
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,910
out rather than trying to

192
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:02,299
make it to be 80% or whatever percent is

193
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:04,399
the recommended dry weight is that do I

194
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:06,889
have that right exactly so instead of

195
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,659
baking out the water content we test for

196
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:12,169
it chemically and then subtract it from

197
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:16,429
the result excellent excellent

198
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:19,000
now when you get so a consumer going

199
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:21,559
into dispensary and buying some flour

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,659
what is sort of the average water

201
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,819
content there does it vary between the

202
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:30,980
different buds or the different strains

203
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:36,740
or is it sort relatively consistent we

204
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:41,680
see cured bud coming in at around four

205
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,680
to ten percent water content by weight

206
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:49,159
okay that's a that's a decent range yeah

207
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:50,990
you know when you're talking about the

208
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,389
testing limits in Massachusetts where

209
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,750
we're quantifying down to parts per

210
00:09:53,389 --> 00:10:01,069
billion levels that range has a huge

211
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:04,340
impact on the final result and now is

212
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,800
that specifically for potency or can

213
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,960
that apply to you know heavy metals and

214
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,769
other contaminants as well yeah it's a

215
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,030
good question

216
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:17,500
every single result that is reported for

217
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:22,610
a flower or plant based sample is

218
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:26,120
impacted by water content okay okay so

219
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,070
this all really seems to jive with the

220
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,820
article that I was reading that you and

221
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:34,250
Cindy Orser had authored that was all

222
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,550
about cannabis uncertainty and so and

223
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,529
how you know if you're taking a big

224
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,569
batch of cannabis and selecting

225
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:44,839
different sub samples of that to do your

226
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:47,390
testing the the difference in those

227
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,460
different sub simples can be pretty vast

228
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:51,620
and I imagine that this water content is

229
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:58,759
just another variable that goes into

230
00:10:51,620 --> 00:11:01,159
that fair to say yeah yeah so that

231
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,679
article was a blast to write with Cindy

232
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,209
I think it's you know medicinal genomics

233
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,169
is great about this too is the

234
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,980
collaboration to talk about these

235
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:12,699
variables like

236
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,830
measurement uncertainty water content

237
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,020
you know why is it that people are

238
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,200
getting different results for what they

239
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,029
think is the same batch so those

240
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,370
discussions are really important to have

241
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:28,339
and yeah you're right that article does

242
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:34,279
encompass a lot of different discussions

243
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:36,530
on what can impact your test results and

244
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,730
so in addition to water content what are

245
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,889
some of the other things that can be

246
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,470
leading to this uncertainty problem is

247
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:45,080
it something that's just sort of a

248
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,810
necessary evil of testing something like

249
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,670
like cannabis flour or is it something

250
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:52,699
that there's not enough standards

251
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:55,759
between the labs combination of the two

252
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,879
or more yeah I mean you covered a good

253
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:02,389
bit of them but it is true to say that

254
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,639
any measurement that is taken whether

255
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:08,629
you're measuring a string with a ruler

256
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:11,899
or you're measuring the mana grams of

257
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:14,299
pesticide and one gram of flour both of

258
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:18,860
those situations are going to have a

259
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:21,889
plus or minus around the result so the

260
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,980
article that Cindy and I wrote goes into

261
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:27,529
some other variables that could be

262
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,230
adding to this plus or minus we already

263
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,389
talked about water content and you

264
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,500
briefly brought up testing different

265
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:39,500
buds from the same plant and how the

266
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,450
plant itself being inconsistent

267
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,960
throughout in terms of cannabinoid

268
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:47,120
concentration and possibly contaminants

269
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:51,860
does contribute to the plus or minus of

270
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:56,179
your result and the most efficient way

271
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,490
to mitigate that is to have homogeneous

272
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:01,009
batches of product meaning that they're

273
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,430
well mixed and that they are the same

274
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:07,100
throughout so that when a sample a

275
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:09,379
subsample of that batch is taken to a

276
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,190
laboratory the results for that

277
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:19,070
subsample actually represent the batch

278
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:20,570
itself now that's gonna be pretty hard

279
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,490
to do with cannabis flower though

280
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,540
because you don't want to you know take

281
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,399
a huge

282
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:27,349
a huge batch and grind it all up because

283
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,360
then you're gonna you know lose your bag

284
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,389
appeal lose those nice beautiful buds

285
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:37,850
that people are so interested in so how

286
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:39,889
do you how do you overcome that it's

287
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,220
difficult and you know instead of

288
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:46,879
overcoming it in an industry where that

289
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:51,110
isn't something that is altogether

290
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:54,528
possible you instead have to accurately

291
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:57,709
account for it and what I mean by that

292
00:13:54,528 --> 00:14:00,519
is you know if one bud has a different

293
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:04,338
result than another bud then

294
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,289
understanding that when you look at the

295
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:09,019
label of your product of your cannabis

296
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:13,250
buds when you pull a bud from that

297
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:19,278
container to consume that that bud could

298
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:22,759
be plus or minus 50% or more of what is

299
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:26,179
on the label and it's you know that can

300
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,970
be alarming but at the same time knowing

301
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:34,269
that and understanding it is is just as

302
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:38,028
important as solving it Wow 50% that's

303
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:40,339
that's significant at Lee's especially I

304
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:43,338
didn't mean to cut you off but there is

305
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:46,279
a peer-reviewed publication in forensic

306
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:49,760
science International where they show

307
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:53,269
the test results of different plants

308
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:56,088
that are within the same clone and how

309
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:59,839
much the cannabinoid results vary from

310
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:01,699
bud to bud so that's that's an

311
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,529
interesting to look at interesting one

312
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:07,309
to look at if you're if you want to get

313
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:10,159
into it even further yeah and you know

314
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:12,528
I'm just thinking with with can med

315
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,389
being so focused on using cannabis as a

316
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:17,120
medicine that's going to be something

317
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,470
that if you are using flower to treat

318
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,379
your condition that's something you

319
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:25,850
really need to take take seriously so

320
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:27,198
you know what are your thoughts I mean I

321
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,250
know you're not a physician you're not

322
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,429
going to be giving out any medical

323
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,828
advice but in terms of patients who are

324
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:35,568
treating with cannabis flower what are

325
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:38,120
sort of sort of some things that they

326
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:41,669
need to keep in mind

327
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,350
you know it's first of all I appreciate

328
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:46,799
you recognizing that I'm not a medical

329
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:52,019
doctor philosophy is a completely

330
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:56,009
different deal I look more towards the

331
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:58,919
products that are available that are a

332
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:02,069
little bit more homogeneous meaning you

333
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:06,000
know liquids and it's you know they all

334
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:09,930
have their own inhomogeneity variables

335
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,809
related to them and until someone does a

336
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:16,609
test comparing the homogeneity of

337
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:20,699
cannabis infused products to

338
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:23,129
concentrates or extracts to flowers it's

339
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,370
it's kind of hard to to navigate that

340
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:29,250
question but theoretically I would

341
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:34,230
assume that liquid or cannabis infused

342
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:39,149
product based options are more

343
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:41,460
homogeneous than buds themselves right

344
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:44,189
but then then comes the whole problem of

345
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,600
you know consistency from batch to batch

346
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:51,810
or locked a lot which I can imagine can

347
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,290
vary as well just because of whether it

348
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:58,889
be sourcing the the material or changing

349
00:16:55,289 --> 00:17:03,379
in production or things like that yeah

350
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:05,309
that's true and you know in with with

351
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,578
pharmaceuticals that's that's where I

352
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:11,129
come from as a pharmaceutical industry

353
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:15,269
the USP has very strict testing

354
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:20,209
requirements that have to be met in

355
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:23,459
order for a sample to be even considered

356
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:28,590
representative of the batch and those

357
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:32,340
tests into taking you know 30-plus units

358
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:34,980
and testing them individually and they

359
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:38,730
have to be within the same result in

360
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:42,180
order to actually move forward with with

361
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,920
that batch so I I do see the cannabis

362
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,039
industry eventually getting to the point

363
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,990
where they require homogeneity testing I

364
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,750
have seen clients that are

365
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:57,069
starting to undertake homogeneity

366
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:59,130
testing as just a precaution for their

367
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:03,279
business because what that does is it

368
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:07,800
gives them a snapshot of how consistent

369
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:10,240
their product is and it ensures their

370
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,299
clients the consumers of this product

371
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,700
that they can expect that the label

372
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:18,308
represents what they are consuming and

373
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,009
that it's consistent as well so it's

374
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:23,170
actually a big advantage to the

375
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:26,230
marketing of a product to go ahead and

376
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:29,170
undertake this homogeneity testing and

377
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:33,400
to shoot to create a more consistent

378
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:36,970
product yeah and I imagine that's where

379
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,100
we hope this is all going or is that the

380
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,980
the companies and the manufacturers will

381
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:44,769
do all this testing not because they

382
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,660
have to but because they want to or

383
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:51,009
because the customer demands it or

384
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,540
expects it so it's good to see that at

385
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:55,058
least some are already taking that step

386
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:57,750
and eventually everyone will get there

387
00:18:55,058 --> 00:19:00,119
so you mentioned you came from

388
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,769
pharmaceutical testing and I'm curious

389
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,750
when you say that you know in the

390
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:07,000
cannabis space that the the difference

391
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,380
in concentrations can be up to you know

392
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,730
50% where is it that the pharmaceuticals

393
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,429
what percentage or what difference are

394
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:20,440
they really aiming for in terms of

395
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:24,040
consistency so with with cannabis I

396
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,500
think the 50% is gonna be a relatively

397
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:29,409
normal happening I think that the

398
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,179
concentration can be a plus or minus

399
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:35,259
more than 50%

400
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:38,880
just to clarify in pharmaceuticals

401
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:41,200
they're looking for they measure

402
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,270
consistency by a metric called relative

403
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,759
standard deviation and so there are USP

404
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:51,210
guidelines on it's called content

405
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:58,299
uniformity is the title of the document

406
00:19:51,210 --> 00:20:00,700
where they give different different

407
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:05,308
relative percent differences based on

408
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,308
the product type and how potent it is

409
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,240
okay okay that makes sense I did want to

410
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,400
go back to you mentioned when we were

411
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,950
kind of talking about alternatives to

412
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,480
using maybe cannabis flour for treating

413
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:24,670
a condition that there are stiffer --nt

414
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,150
cannabis infused products out there

415
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:30,070
and I'm curious because you see all

416
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,990
different types of cannabis infused

417
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:33,939
products out there I'm wondering what

418
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,650
are the sort of the normal ones that

419
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,570
come through your lab or maybe some of

420
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:41,830
the not so normal ones that may have

421
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:45,039
come through your lab we see a myriad of

422
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:47,049
different matrices and we're not

423
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,769
generally surprised anymore we've seen

424
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:53,829
anything from infused drinks that market

425
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:58,029
is growing and we see a lot of infused

426
00:20:53,829 --> 00:21:02,139
chocolate products a lot of infused

427
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:05,109
gummy products and more recently vaginal

428
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,940
and anal suppositories I mean it's the

429
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:12,119
list of products that we see in the lab

430
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:14,380
just is unending ya know it seems like

431
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:16,239
seems like every week every month

432
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,850
they're coming up with a new a new thing

433
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,920
to infuse cannabis into what is the most

434
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:24,490
challenging of the matrices that you've

435
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,289
had to deal with I would say be infused

436
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:29,620
drinks um

437
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:35,190
infused palmerston yeah you know infused

438
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:40,959
products in general require more astute

439
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:44,980
testing because they include ingredients

440
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,009
that could possibly interfere with the

441
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:52,390
test they could interfere with the test

442
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:54,160
by covering up the signal of the analyte

443
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,720
that we're looking for or we can't see

444
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,210
the cannabinoid or we can't see the

445
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,559
metal they could in few they could

446
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:06,569
interfere with the test in a way that

447
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:08,529
those ingredients hold on to the

448
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:10,450
Constituent that we're looking for and

449
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:13,599
keep it from being in the solution that

450
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:16,970
we're looking to test and to mitigate

451
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:21,659
that CDX has launched a

452
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:24,299
formulation test and what that is is we

453
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,580
actually go in and we work through the

454
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:29,369
sample in several different methods to

455
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:34,460
ensure that those things that that those

456
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:36,869
possibilities are mitigated so you know

457
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,700
cannabis infused products in general

458
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:41,869
where we're talking about literally an

459
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:45,330
infinite list of possible interferences

460
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:50,179
have to be taken seriously in testing

461
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:54,149
and you know in any instance where

462
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:57,120
anybody says that they have a one method

463
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,130
solves all process they just simply

464
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,669
haven't looked into it in-depth enough

465
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,020
to to find that there are variables in

466
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:08,100
these different cannabis infused

467
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:11,190
products that do impact their tests so

468
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:13,259
you basically put any new cannabis type

469
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,360
product through sort of a battery of

470
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,769
tests to sort of really break down

471
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,279
what's in there and what could

472
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:22,319
potentially be throwing off your results

473
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,029
right this is this is something that we

474
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,269
have been working with a few of our

475
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:30,480
clients in doing and this is actually

476
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:32,670
part of what I plan on presenting at kin

477
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,890
med so it's it's gonna be a

478
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:40,080
demonstration of how you know different

479
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,050
methods can give different results on

480
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,299
the same exact products and

481
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:47,460
understanding how to take that knowledge

482
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:51,180
and mitigate in order to report an

483
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:54,840
accurate and precise result what an

484
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:57,509
excellent segue so the yeah the title of

485
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:00,000
your talk here is navigating cannabis

486
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:02,849
method options through implementation of

487
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,490
novel validation design and statistical

488
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:07,740
comparison and you did just give a

489
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,420
little bit of a preview with about what

490
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,859
that talk is going to be about but it

491
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,580
it's wonder if you give us a little bit

492
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:18,389
more absolutely so we we have a lot of

493
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:21,359
different testing options as as

494
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:24,420
third-party testers in the cannabis

495
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:27,299
industry a lot of instrument vendors

496
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,370
have prepackaged methods and

497
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,389
instrumentation that can be used to

498
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:33,329
measure

499
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:36,300
the cannabinoid concentration or the

500
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:38,250
heavy-metal concentration or as you very

501
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:44,839
well know the microbial concentrations

502
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:47,190
and the talk is going to be about how to

503
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,839
choose the method that is most

504
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:52,680
appropriate for what it is that you're

505
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:56,490
doing in a quantitative and statistical

506
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:59,430
way because you know accurate science is

507
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:03,029
all about absolving subjectivity as much

508
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:06,000
as possible and looking at the data and

509
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:08,849
the relative standard deviations and the

510
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,910
robustness that's what's going to give

511
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:15,889
you the answer to which platform you

512
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,890
should choose to do your testing

513
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,680
excellent excellent

514
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:25,650
so what are some of the the different

515
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:28,620
methods or ocean say methods but what

516
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,450
are some of the different types of

517
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:32,639
testing that you are going to be sort of

518
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,940
highlighting in your talk is it more on

519
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,540
the the potency side heavy metals

520
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:42,720
microbials a little bit of everything we

521
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:45,000
find different avenues everyday that

522
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,089
we're in the lab so what I plan on doing

523
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,670
is choosing the ones that best

524
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:53,519
illustrate the need for a quantitative

525
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:55,470
decision making and right now it's

526
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,259
looking like that discussion will be

527
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,600
based on microbial testing there was a

528
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:02,160
little bit of a preview to this given by

529
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,469
Yvonne

530
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,920
she's already presented this last fall

531
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:09,450
with the the groom reefer and so you

532
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,230
know I might build on that a little bit

533
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:15,059
with the in lab testing we did its EDX

534
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:20,069
and the validation that we have for

535
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:21,720
inter laboratories but I have a lot of

536
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:24,509
different options in terms of what other

537
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,049
test methods I include could be a little

538
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:30,420
bit on the water content quantification

539
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:33,299
we talked about earlier comparing that

540
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:36,090
to the loss on drying method in terms of

541
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:38,519
precision and accuracy and robustness I

542
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:41,459
could talk about cannabis infused

543
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,319
products and different extraction

544
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,250
methods for cannabinoid testing and how

545
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,710
those impacts

546
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:51,000
the results it just goes on and on it's

547
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:54,150
such an exciting new industry you know

548
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,609
scientists have only had you know 2025

549
00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:02,340
years to work with this matrix and it's

550
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:05,189
really fun to be a part of you know

551
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:08,039
battening down the hatches and coming up

552
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:10,950
with methods that consistently trump

553
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:14,190
what was currently in use days weeks

554
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:17,360
months or years before we're gonna have

555
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,950
to block off a whole afternoon for you I

556
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:24,839
don't know about that man you laptop to

557
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:26,850
AJ no but um it's I'm glad that you

558
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:30,539
brought up Grim Reaper in the talk that

559
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:32,369
Yvonne had given at kin med 2019 because

560
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:34,019
you did contribute a lot of great data

561
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:36,869
that was used in that we want to thank

562
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,759
you very much for that and if folks are

563
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:41,729
interested they can check out that talk

564
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,640
and all that came a 20-19 talks at kim

565
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,349
at events comm nice little plug in there

566
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,920
for that

567
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:51,839
so you mentioned what you did before you

568
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,140
got into the cannabis space a little bit

569
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,429
briefly but I was wondering a bit more

570
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,950
what did you do before you got into

571
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:02,670
cannabis and and why did you decide to

572
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:06,210
make the switch sure it's been a long

573
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:10,230
journey but just very quickly you know I

574
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:14,569
I have a chemistry bachelor's with two

575
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:17,610
art minors art history and studio art

576
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:21,629
after that I got my PhD in analytical

577
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:25,889
chemistry and during that time I worked

578
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:29,540
on a lot of forensic applications blood

579
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:32,130
detection blood stain age development

580
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:35,099
using different light based techniques

581
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:39,060
combined with statistical data analysis

582
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:41,309
to correctly classify unknowns a lot of

583
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:44,480
really fun stuff I also did

584
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:48,509
environmental sampling and testing and

585
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,289
from there I moved on to the

586
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:56,750
pharmaceutical industry where I worked

587
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:57,829
to identify the impacts different

588
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,778
formulation

589
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:02,089
have on active pharmaceutical

590
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:08,140
ingredients so essentially what I did

591
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:11,629
was keep track of what fillers in drugs

592
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:14,080
do to the drugs themselves and how they

593
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:18,019
impact the expiration date of the drug

594
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:21,109
so that work it turned out to be

595
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:22,880
incredibly relevant especially to

596
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:26,839
cannabis infused products and I'm really

597
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,630
excited to apply that but in getting

598
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:32,569
into the cannabis industry it was

599
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:35,260
something you know like I said it's so

600
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:38,928
new people really haven't had time to

601
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:40,638
mail down the testing methods and there

602
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:42,500
aren't they there weren't that many in

603
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:46,609
peer-reviewed publications and still art

604
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,589
on cannabis testing so that was very

605
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:50,829
lucrative to me I thought it would be

606
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:54,740
neat to be a part of something where

607
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:58,428
creativity paired with chemical

608
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:00,769
knowledge could be used to really give

609
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,630
back and have a high impact to society

610
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:06,649
so that's what I did

611
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:08,389
you know I worked at CDX analytics for

612
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:11,509
nearly a year with state of the art

613
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:14,829
brand new instrumentation designing

614
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:18,200
methods and I'm very grateful that the

615
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:20,569
president and CEO of CDX has a PhD

616
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,460
himself because I don't know any other

617
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:25,428
businessman that would give me that long

618
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,769
to come up with these methods but you

619
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:30,380
know the creativity I had from my art

620
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:32,839
background really did come in handy and

621
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,230
I was given the time to look into the

622
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,548
variables that impact test results that

623
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:41,058
really has given us an insight into the

624
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:42,769
industry today yeah I think that's

625
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:44,298
that's one of the things that we all

626
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:47,450
really love about the cannabis industry

627
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:49,548
is that it's such such a frontier you're

628
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,009
such you know fertile ground for us to

629
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:54,379
apply creativity and kind of innovative

630
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:56,599
solutions to really push this thing

631
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,100
forward so that's really interesting I

632
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,849
had no idea you had an art background

633
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:05,359
what what what specifically you painter

634
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:09,589
sculptor well like I said one of the

635
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:11,869
minors is in art history so looking back

636
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:14,658
you know all the different time periods

637
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:16,339
and what drove art and what what the

638
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:18,080
artists were thinking at the times that

639
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:22,428
they were creating the pieces that they

640
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:24,859
created but my studio art was centered

641
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:29,330
first on drawing and then on oil

642
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:31,250
painting excellent yeah we're gonna have

643
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:35,509
to Commission you to paint a mural for

644
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:37,250
us in the office well my husband is it's

645
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:40,599
funny I recently came home with

646
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:43,308
something that I did and he told me that

647
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:49,189
we couldn't have any more naked women in

648
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:52,158
the house so apparently I'm not supposed

649
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,649
to be doing the live modeling and in the

650
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,340
studios for a while but I still do keep

651
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:59,538
up with it and I do really enjoy it okay

652
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:01,519
thanks

653
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:04,579
well yeah I'd have to check with HR to

654
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:09,730
make sure we could bring that into the

655
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:09,730
into the mural but not hold my breath I

656
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:14,898
saw the picture of Kevin mckernon

657
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:18,440
superimposed over the Grim Reaper's face

658
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:20,418
and I think that's I think that'll be

659
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,450
just fine that's some pretty pretty

660
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:27,500
heightened artistic ability right there

661
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:31,220
there you go yeah so so wrapping up here

662
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,349
I know you said you were really excited

663
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:36,110
to have to be coming to Canada and we're

664
