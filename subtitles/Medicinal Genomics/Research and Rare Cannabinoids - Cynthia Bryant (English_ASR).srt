1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,519
good morning everyone

2
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,400
so i'm cynthia bryant i'm the chief

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,839
business officer at demetrix

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,559
and um

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,559
really happy to be here today to talk a

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,719
little bit about what we do

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,399
and the research that we're performing

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,000
it's a little bit different than i think

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,159
a lot of the

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,719
other companies here we're not a

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,359
plant-based grower so

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,919
let me tell you first about demetrics

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,640
and then we'll get into the rest of it

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,120
so dimitrix the company was founded by a

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,719
gentleman jay kiesling he's a uc

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,878
berkeley professor

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,399
who started several companies in

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,439
biotechnology

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,079
that are dedicated to producing rare

20
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,679
ingredients to help promote human health

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,399
and wellness

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,399
and at demetrix we provide affordable

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,840
sustainable access

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,160
to rare plant ingredients for healthier

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,480
lives and we're specifically focused on

26
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,558
rare cannabinoids

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,840
so the way that

28
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,959
demetrics

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,359
operates is on these pillars of

30
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,719
ensuring that we have high purity

31
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,759
product

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,158
so 98 pure or better

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,438
we produce in a very sustainable

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,040
fashion biotechnology uses a lot less

35
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:27,519
resources than typical agriculture when

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,320
you're talking about rare ingredients

37
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,560
and everything we do is science-backed

38
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,639
in terms of the the research that we

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,960
perform as well as the technology we

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,439
develop and these three things are what

41
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,399
really drives our innovation

42
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:45,039
and by innovation what i'm really

43
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,399
speaking to is the

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,520
desire to find new ingredients to help

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,359
people and to then design production

46
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,599
processes that can bring those

47
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,319
ingredients at high enough volumes and

48
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:02,718
high enough purity to be available and

49
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,718
affordable to those that are in need

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,439
so how do we do this um so if we just

51
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,519
take the cannabis plant there's over a

52
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,878
hundred different cannabinoids in this

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,280
plant

54
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,919
but the fact of the matter is most of

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,120
these cannabinoids are in such small

56
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,000
quantities in the plant that it is just

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
impossible to be able to isolate them at

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
the volumes needed to properly research

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
them

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,000
and this is where biotechnology comes in

61
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:33,039
because what we can do is we can produce

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,120
single cannabinoids completely agnostic

63
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,280
to how rare or common they are in the

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,759
plant and we can produce them at high

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,800
volumes and high purity so that they can

66
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,519
become available for researchers to do

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,599
research on these specific isolates and

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,239
understand what the individual

69
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,560
cannabinoids contribute in terms of

70
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,439
beneficial properties for for many

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,439
indications

72
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,200
moving on this is a picture of our labs

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,519
in berkeley california where we're

74
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,000
headquartered and so

75
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,400
we use fermentation to produce these

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,120
cannabinoids so we take a

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,360
microorganism such as yeast baker's

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,080
yeast commonly used for

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,239
beer in producing bread and we program

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,360
it and say we want you now to make this

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,640
specific cannabinoid we develop a very

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,959
controlled

83
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,559
production environment in a bioreactor

84
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,640
which is a fancy word of saying a

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,719
fermentation tank

86
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,559
and we grow these yeast and as these

87
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,878
grow and as they are in an environment

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,959
that's conducive they start to produce

89
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,798
that cannabinoid and then we purify it

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,439
from the fermentation broth and we have

91
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,439
our product

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,479
so the benefit of this especially when

93
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,518
we're talking about rare ingredients

94
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,759
is the reduction in water

95
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,719
energy and land use

96
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,000
because

97
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,840
no matter if we're talking about a

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,400
cannabinoid or a fragrance ingredient

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,719
that particular plant has to produce an

100
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,640
entire plant it has to produce the roots

101
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,438
the leaves the stems sometimes the

102
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,119
flowers etc as well as that specific

103
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,519
ingredient we're after and if that

104
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,519
ingredient in the plant is very rare

105
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,319
you're creating a lot of

106
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,798
added biomass a lot of energy input a

107
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,358
lot of water utilization for just that

108
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,599
small component and we take all of that

109
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,198
out because all we're doing is using a

110
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
small

111
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,000
yeast and actually over a thousand

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,800
yeasts can fit into a trichome on a

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,120
cannabis plant and we're telling it only

114
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,120
to make that specific rare cannabinoid

115
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,680
so i know everybody here is very aware

116
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,799
of the

117
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,560
system

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,079
when you hear about cannabinoids a lot

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,879
of times what people talk about are the

120
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,000
cb1 and cb2 receptors

121
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,639
what we've been doing with our

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,639
technology is we now have over 40

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,040
different rare cannabinoids that we have

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,879
been taking through various

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,600
research to understand and catalog what

126
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,319
they actually do from a human physiology

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,039
perspective in terms of the receptors

128
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,918
that they interact with and also taking

129
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,759
them into in vitro and a little bit in

130
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,120
vivo

131
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,600
tests to then prove to understand

132
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,840
do they actually manifest into the

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,800
specific benefits that they we hope that

134
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,799
they do

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,400
based on the indications that we see

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,000
through the the receptor screening

137
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,959
and so what i'm going to do for the rest

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,839
of this uh presentation is talk a little

139
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,319
bit about one specific cannabinoid

140
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,879
out of the the 40 that we currently have

141
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,639
under research and that's cbg

142
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,439
or cannabis era

143
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,400
and so we recently uh commercialized

144
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:51,038
cannabidiol as a retail g

145
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,439
and with our partner evonik industries

146
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,439
which is a large german ingredient

147
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,759
supplier are now bringing this

148
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,560
ingredient to the market for personal

149
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,560
care use

150
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,720
so there's a couple of things there's a

151
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,279
lot of research out there about

152
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,080
cannabidiol in general and there's

153
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,519
indications that it's a very strong

154
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,758
anti-inflammatory we also see that it

155
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,240
has antimicrobial effects and strong

156
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,800
antioxidant properties

157
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,199
but a lot of this then we have to do

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,600
further research to understand does that

159
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,319
translate into an actual claim because a

160
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,439
lot of this is done at receptor or very

161
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,400
preliminary screening levels

162
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,639
so

163
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,079
the work that demetrics did was specific

164
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:42,879
to our cannabis gerald erete g which is

165
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,959
98 pure it has zero thc in it uh our

166
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,399
process is completely incapable of

167
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,239
producing thc has zero terpenes so this

168
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,038
is a very clean

169
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,360
isolate that that we've taken into this

170
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,360
research

171
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
and what we've seen when we we took it

172
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,598
through is

173
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,720
initially it was gpcr and ion channel

174
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,319
screening and we saw strong

175
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,800
anti-inflammatory properties we also saw

176
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,319
that it was a strong antioxidant and we

177
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,840
saw that it had interesting

178
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,520
antimicrobial

179
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,198
potential as well

180
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,918
but the next step that we did is we put

181
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,919
it into in vitro skin assays to

182
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,680
understand does that actually translate

183
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,439
when you start to go into industry

184
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,519
standard testing

185
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,439
and along with it we we took a couple of

186
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,478
other cannabinoids that we have listed

187
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,360
on here

188
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:34,478
through specific in vitro tests

189
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,759
and what we saw is that first of all

190
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,240
all these cannabinoids are

191
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,240
physiologically active and i think that

192
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,918
that's really important

193
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,199
because there's a lot of anecdotal

194
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,279
evidence out there about cannabinoids

195
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,478
but having actually screened through the

196
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:53,519
entire library of gpcrs in the human

197
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,279
body 40 different cannabinoids i can sit

198
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,680
up here and assure you that they do

199
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,279
interact with the human body

200
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,000
we also know that they interact

201
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,719
differently each one has its own unique

202
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,519
fingerprint they do not all do the same

203
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,440
thing

204
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,598
and i think that that's also another

205
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,839
important fact

206
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,878
in discovery that we've made

207
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,038
because

208
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
they're not the same and what that leads

209
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,959
us to believe is that there's a

210
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,319
tremendous amount of potential not only

211
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,719
as individual cannabinoids but to expand

212
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,960
research and understand the

213
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,000
the right combinations

214
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:33,519
of the right cannabinoids to be able to

215
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,599
help people with specific indications

216
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,599
and we're just at scratching the the

217
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,919
surface here in terms of the amount of

218
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,759
research that that still needs to be

219
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,559
done to really harness the true

220
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,720
potential of these ingredients

221
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,958
so here this is this is tip of the

222
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,959
iceberg in terms of what we've done and

223
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,359
also where we need to go

224
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,359
so in these in vitro assays what we see

225
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,680
is the darker color is stronger

226
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,278
indicates stronger performance lighter

227
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,199
less performance

228
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,600
and you can see here even among these

229
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
handful of cannabinoids we see varying

230
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
differences

231
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
the other thing that i'd like to point

232
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,199
out is that

233
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,879
we saw that cbg was a really strong and

234
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,640
interesting antioxidant in basic orac

235
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,039
dpph

236
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:22,240
tests but when we put it into

237
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,838
antioxidant in vitro skin assays we

238
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,159
didn't see that it was a very strong

239
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,080
performer and i think that this is also

240
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,879
another important thing in terms of

241
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,920
taking the research to the next levels

242
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,120
to to really prove out and to

243
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:41,679
elucidate how it translates into that

244
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,560
actual benefit that people need

245
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,120
so

246
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,278
with that we

247
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,720
also went a little bit deeper in terms

248
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,200
of looking at

249
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,879
these specific assays and understanding

250
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,680
the

251
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:58,958
anti-inflammatory effect of cbg on skin

252
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,958
so what we did here is

253
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,159
i just wanted to get it all up

254
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,479
here we go

255
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,360
so we we ran this in vitro assay where

256
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,200
we took normal human dermal fibroblasts

257
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,879
and normal human epidermal keratinocytes

258
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,480
and the first thing we did is we ran

259
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,320
cytotoxicity assays to understand what's

260
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,959
the highest dose that we could actually

261
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,440
use of cannabidiol as well as some other

262
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,958
cannabinoids in these tests

263
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,240
and the first thing that was interesting

264
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,078
is that they are different in their

265
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,240
cytotoxicity

266
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,439
so we ran these tests several times just

267
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,519
to make sure cbg is less cytotoxic than

268
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,079
cannabidiol cbd

269
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,919
by quite a significant amount

270
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,838
and you'll see that in

271
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,838
translated into some of the charts that

272
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,079
i'll show next

273
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,920
once we understood the cytotoxicity we

274
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,679
then were able to determine what the

275
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,439
right concentrations would be so that we

276
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,719
wouldn't destroy the cells in these

277
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
assays

278
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,360
and through

279
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,799
through a plate model put the

280
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,240
erection in with a um

281
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,599
inflammation

282
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,320
stimulated uh inflammation of these

283
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,240
cells and then understood through a

284
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,320
positive and negative control the the

285
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,399
performance of the cbg

286
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,839
so the first one we did was a pma

287
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,679
stimulated model and what you see in

288
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:27,040
here is the percent inhibition so you

289
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:29,519
want to inhibit pma in order to

290
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,240
i'm sorry you want to inhibit il-8

291
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,959
in order to see an anti-inflammatory

292
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,440
reaction so il-8 is one of the key

293
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,599
cytokines in terms of inciting

294
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,160
inflammation

295
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,079
the blue bar that you see is actually

296
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,759
the positive control and that's store

297
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,838
sporane so this is a known

298
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:52,000
anti-inflammatory that works very well

299
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,519
the red bars that you see next to it are

300
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,759
the the percent reduction of cbg so you

301
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,360
can see at the higher concentration

302
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,679
which is three micromolar cbg was right

303
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,519
at the performance of basically of

304
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,439
saurosporine

305
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,278
and we had a really nice dose response

306
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,360
curve with this one

307
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,000
now the gray bars next to it are

308
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,399
actually cannabidiol and what you'll see

309
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,200
there if you look on the x-axis is that

310
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,919
the concentrations are different for cbd

311
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,480
versus cbg and that's just reflective of

312
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,639
the cytotoxicity differences between the

313
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,480
two molecules

314
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,680
but what we found was very interesting

315
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,079
is that we hear a lot about cbd being an

316
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,399
interesting anti-inflammatory

317
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:39,759
and a lot of people translate that into

318
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,720
skin health but what we saw in this

319
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,799
industry standard skin model

320
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,040
is that cbd really wasn't a good

321
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:50,639
anti-inflammatory in terms of other

322
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,278
cannabinoids

323
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,680
now what i don't have on here is uh the

324
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,078
other ones but cbg i'll just share with

325
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:02,000
you was the the most

326
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:05,039
highest performing out of the the lot

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,519
so the next test we did was pge2 in pma

328
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,919
stimulated cells

329
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,560
and here the positive control that you

330
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,078
see is indomethacin

331
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,199
and

332
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:20,479
what we see here is also

333
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,079
a decent i would call it a dose response

334
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,360
what we think is we just hit the upper

335
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,439
limit of of the cbg response which are

336
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
the red bars next to it

337
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,320
but again strong anti-inflammatory

338
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:35,199
properties were seen in this model

339
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,760
cbd in this model showed absolutely no

340
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,639
response in terms of preventing

341
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,639
inflammation

342
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:44,958
so the other thing that we wanted to

343
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,519
make sure is

344
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,679
are these products safe and so we did a

345
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,720
lot of skin irritancy testing these were

346
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,479
in vivo and what we found is that cbg

347
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,278
and cbd

348
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,959
were both

349
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,278
non-sensitizers to skin they're also not

350
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:04,078
ocular irritants or

351
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,919
any way damaging to the eyes so that's

352
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,439
all that this chart is really showing

353
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,919
and it was interesting so we had over

354
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,920
100 test subjects and not a single one

355
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,838
of them showed any indication of

356
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:20,479
irritation with cbg which is pretty rare

357
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,480
so we were very happy with those results

358
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,440
now the other thing we did was minimum

359
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,800
inhibitory concentration assays against

360
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,760
different microorganisms that are

361
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:36,479
interesting ones for skin health

362
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:38,480
so the first one that we did here is um

363
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,360
for skin care is c acnes and there's a

364
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,639
lot of research already on the efficacy

365
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,720
of various cannabinoids on c acnes

366
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,198
what we saw was very similar to that

367
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,000
research so we feel that we've got a

368
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,559
good validation on that

369
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,159
the the next one are actually two oral

370
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,958
care targets which we were surprised to

371
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,879
see

372
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:04,879
so s mutants is a

373
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:08,320
microorganism that is strongly linked to

374
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,360
periodontal disease and is also a very

375
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,000
difficult

376
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,240
microorganism to control with natural

377
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
products per se so the the oral care

378
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,519
industry uses chemical

379
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
ingredients

380
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,519
to

381
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,159
help to control s mutants and toothpaste

382
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,039
mouthwash etc

383
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,600
and the fact that we now have a

384
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,078
potential natural ingredient that not

385
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,800
only showed efficacy against this but

386
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,958
also was not broad spectrum

387
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,479
so these cannabinoids are not broad

388
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,958
spectrum in terms of their

389
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,159
anti-microbial activity they're actually

390
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,638
quite

391
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,399
measured and quite specific and that's

392
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,600
really important because we're all very

393
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,639
aware of antibiotic resistance

394
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,360
and also wanting to cultivate a healthy

395
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,720
microbiome not only on our skin but also

396
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,199
in in our oral cavities

397
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,639
the other thing that it was good is that

398
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,799
it was

399
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,039
active against p gingivalis which i'm

400
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,799
sure all of us are familiar with in

401
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,039
terms of oral care

402
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,838
so here we have an ingredient that's

403
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,599
naturally derived and hits two of the

404
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,560
key oral care

405
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,199
micro

406
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:24,159
organisms that that we want to control

407
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:26,879
for for proper oral care health now when

408
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:29,319
we layer on top of this the fact that

409
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,159
cbg was also showed a strong

410
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,240
anti-inflammatory response against il8

411
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,360
it gets even more interesting for oral

412
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,000
care because there's research showing

413
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,519
that il8

414
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
inflammation

415
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,399
is a

416
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,839
link to chronic periodontal disease so

417
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,000
not only do you have to control the

418
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,560
microbiome but you also need to control

419
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,720
the the inflammation

420
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,479
so really really interesting results

421
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,800
with this

422
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,680
the other one is personal care and here

423
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:04,399
m firfer was an interesting target that

424
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:09,038
cbg showed efficacy against

425
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,360
m firfer is one of the funguses that is

426
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,000
often linked to dandruff there's three

427
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,399
of them m fervor is one and depending on

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,720
what region of the world you live and

429
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,519
furffer is either more important or less

430
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,318
important in terms of controlling

431
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,838
the the dandruff so mainly southeast

432
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:30,960
asia is where that's really important

433
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,960
but it is also one of the key reasons

434
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,000
that some people suffer from tinea

435
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,840
versus color so this is the skin

436
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,880
condition that often shows up on the

437
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,159
backs where people have white patches on

438
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,480
their skin

439
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,000
and this can be a very difficult

440
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,960
condition to treat and to have yet again

441
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
a natural ingredient that shows efficacy

442
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,919
against this m for fungus

443
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,240
shows a lot of promise to help people

444
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,840
not only to look good but also to feel

445
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,839
better about themselves

446
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,798
so

447
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,200
in in summary what we're seeing

448
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,400
specifically with cannabis gerald or

449
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,319
rettayg

450
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,480
is that it shows

451
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,359
a lot of promise for

452
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,240
um

453
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,678
aiding and being a good bioactive for

454
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,079
skin care

455
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,240
not only for what i'll call the more

456
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,399
cosmetic concerns

457
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,120
in terms of anti-aging support a lot of

458
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,200
anti-aging

459
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,000
or a lot of the aging from our skin is

460
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,400
an inflammation response so if we can

461
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,440
control the inflammation we can slow

462
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,600
down the the aging process is the theory

463
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,279
but it can also help in some other

464
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,079
conditions that

465
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,558
quite frankly probably have a lot

466
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,558
stronger or greater impact on how people

467
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:54,079
feel about themselves and and their

468
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:57,519
well-being in terms of helping with acne

469
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:00,000
also as mentioned tinea varus of color

470
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,798
and then oral health i can't stress

471
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,919
enough how important oral health is it's

472
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,839
linked to

473
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,320
not only you know

474
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,879
diseases within the mouth but it's also

475
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,519
now being linked to

476
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,919
certain cns concerns

477
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,599
with things that are microorganisms

478
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,000
potentially

479
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:23,599
going through the blood brain barrier

480
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,279
and through the oral cavity and creating

481
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,119
issues with

482
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,399
mental health

483
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,759
it can also

484
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,320
be linked to

485
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,279
digestive support as well

486
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:39,119
so being able to balance the microbiome

487
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:44,240
in our oral cavity has wider range

488
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,239
benefits than just having a pretty smile

489
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,038
as mentioned we are looking at other

490
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,120
cannabinoids we have over 40 that we're

491
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:54,160
taking through many of these various

492
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,439
assays and and also we'll be taking into

493
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,798
clinicals with our partners and what i'd

494
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,519
like to just leave you with is that

495
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:06,158
i'm super excited about

496
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,400
where we are today in terms of helping

497
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,159
people with health and wellness as an

498
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,960
industry

499
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,760
this plant has so many interesting

500
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,960
ingredients in it that hold so much

501
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:21,440
potential to really help people in a

502
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,640
safe and an effective way and i think

503
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,798
that as an industry we owe it to the

504
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,840
consumers around the world

505
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:32,480
to do the proper research and to provide

506
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:35,279
products that we know will work time and

507
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,880
time again and understand how they work

508
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,678
and why they work

509
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,600
so that we can provide real solutions

510
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,200
time and time again for people that are

511
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,158
in need for that

512
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,080
so we are always happy to to share more

513
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,559
about the research we're doing we

514
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,678
believe that education is key in this

515
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,639
industry

516
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,038
and that we need to stand on each

517
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,400
other's shoulders so to say

518
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,960
so we

519
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,360
welcome conversation and for people to

520
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,679
reach out to us to learn more about what

521
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,158
we're doing and our findings we will

522
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,400
also be communicating a lot of these as

523
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,960
uh we we learn more

524
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,280
and look forward to to speaking with you

525
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,440
all uh about what we're doing in further

526
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,019
detail

527
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:26,739
thank you

528
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:26,739
[Applause]

529
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,558
hi very interesting presentation

530
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,038
of the 40 somali cannabinoids that

531
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:38,079
you've isolated are you able to say how

532
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,079
many are identical to those produced by

533
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,158
cannabis sativa as opposed to new

534
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,720
chemical entities

535
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,960
they're all 100 percent identical so

536
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,159
every single cannabinoid we produce can

537
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,240
be found in the plant they're just

538
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,400
in such small quantities we can't

539
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,200
physically isolate them from the plant

540
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,200
but they're all natural okay thank you

541
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,038
yeah

542
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
wonderful talk i was just wondering if

543
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,400
you were able to look at the acid forms

544
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,840
of some of these are you just producing

545
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,360
the neutral forms

546
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,639
i i'm sorry i had a hard time hearing

547
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,479
you sorry i was wondering if you were

548
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,919
able to look at the acid forms of some

549
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,919
of these compounds or you're only able

550
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,840
to produce the neutral forms no we can

551
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,240
produce both so we we are looking at

552
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,158
both acid in neutral forms and i will

553
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,079
say the acids do behave differently than

554
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,640
the neutrals physiologically speaking

555
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,678
does neutral mean decarboxylated yes

556
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,159
okay i'm just just checking um this the

557
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,360
the the cbg for the

558
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,600
um

559
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,519
the clinicals that you did do you know

560
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,119
what percent concentration

561
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,038
or do you have a recommendation for a

562
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,959
percentage of concentration for a

563
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,279
product application

564
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,798
yeah so in in skin care specifically you

565
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,960
usually don't want to go above one

566
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,240
percent and this is consumer product

567
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,400
skin care

568
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,839
um so we're currently doing clinicals to

569
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,360
see its efficacy at that one percent

570
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,199
but for an otc or pharmaceutical

571
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,279
depending on the formulation you could

572
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,360
go higher but the clinicals would need

573
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:09,480
to be done to to check the actual

574
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,479
efficacy within the formulation

575
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,280
hi

576
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,720
are the commercial products are they

577
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,440
topicals are they something that you

578
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,240
would ingest orally yes so right now our

579
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,640
partner evonik is specific to topicals

580
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,759
personal care but we are currently

581
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,080
working with the fda as well as essa to

582
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,558
get the proper approvals for ingestible

583
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,558
products

584
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,880
hi thank you for the nice nice talk um i

585
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,280
was

586
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,559
that you had very little um reactions

587
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,480
like negative reactions when it was on

588
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,200
people's skin did you have any issues

589
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,640
with it clogging pores or the molecules

590
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,720
the right size so that it's not going to

591
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,640
cause any like fur like it might reduce

592
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,079
some breakouts when i produce some or

593
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,360
how is that

594
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,439
yeah we we did not see any um issue with

595
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,439
clogging pores these are fairly small

596
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,519
molecules it really depends also though

597
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,919
on the formulation that you put the the

598
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,960
can of a gel in because cannabidiol

599
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,840
itself

600
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,079
is a solid so you have to solubilize it

601
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,918
in something to apply it to skin and

602
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,399
depending on what you solubilize it and

603
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,038
then maybe you can get into comedogetic

604
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,320
issues yeah but the canopy gerald itself

605
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,720
is non-kinetogenic awesome thank you

606
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,639
thank you so much for your talk uh what

607
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,278
was the method that you used to measure

608
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,400
il8 and pge2

609
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,480
levels

610
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,519
um i believe it was

611
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,960
fluorescence i'm looking at

612
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,960
eliza i'm sorry i was an eliza

613
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,158
thank you so much for sharing your work

614
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,519
that was really

615
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,600
enlightening

616
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,558
i had a question

617
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:51,278
about the 2 percent that's left after

618
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:54,079
the 98 cbg i wonder if you've

619
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,558
fractionated and taken out the cbg to

620
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:59,038
look at efficacy as we saw last night

621
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,918
with daddy mary's talk sometimes that

622
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,440
really low percentage can be really

623
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,159
effective as well

624
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,480
yeah so um the key thing to keep in mind

625
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,039
is that we don't use any plant material

626
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,000
um so the the two percent that's left in

627
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:17,038
our product actually comes from the

628
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,480
yeast that's used to to produce the the

629
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,079
cannabinoids so it's mainly things like

630
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,880
carbohydrates and proteins there's no

631
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,199
terpenes in it or

632
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,880
other cannabinoids except for maybe some

633
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,880
cbga that wasn't fully decarboxylated

634
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,360
hi

635
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,240
thank you for

636
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:43,599
presentation um just quick question why

637
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,640
the particular focus on il-8 keratins

638
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,519
were like

639
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,520
why

640
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,879
why not il3

641
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,440
yeah so there's

642
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,520
there's a lot of different

643
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,519
inflammation markers within the skin and

644
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:59,599
the skin assays but if you hit il-8 then

645
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,359
that's kind of like the the key

646
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,240
indicator that you are going to see an

647
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:07,839
anti-inflammatory response there's

648
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,000
others like il-6 etc but the assays for

649
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,959
those are not as

650
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,960
robust and so that's why we picked iol8

651
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,640
because it's a much more robust assay

652
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,480
and if you hit isolate then you're

653
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,759
pretty assured that you're going to see

654
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,599
an anti-inflammatory response in skin

655
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,519
versus some of these others where you

656
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,000
might get a false positive or a false

657
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,000
negative

658
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,519
go ahead kevin

659
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:36,000
excellent talk you're a good speaker um

660
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,480
so i'm just trying to clarify in my own

661
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,519
mind so the

662
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,679
you're producing cbga but they're the

663
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,158
yeast of producing cbga and then you're

664
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,320
decaboxylating yes yes good

665
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,520
clarification the yeast also just like

666
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:54,079
the plant produces the acid form

667
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:57,440
but because of the way that we produce

668
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:59,839
we are able to easily purify to keep the

669
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,080
acid form if that's what we want or we

670
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:05,359
can decarboxylate it into the neutral

671
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:07,599
form so if that's the case

672
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:10,000
why no research on cbga or have you done

673
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,240
research we have done research on cbga

674
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,640
as well yeah it's just we um we launched

675
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,558
cbg first so can you enlighten us on any

676
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,520
of the cbga research

677
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,918
yeah so cbga was um

678
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:25,200
for for skin it was

679
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,159
more active for hyperpigmentation

680
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,120
and ros support

681
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,840
um looking at the receptors it focused

682
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,079
more on the pain

683
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:37,759
receptors thank you yeah

684
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,079
i had a feeling he might ask my question

685
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,519
so i wanted him to go first i also have

686
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,278
a question that was similar to that but

687
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,200
i also wanted to know how

688
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,319
have you guys done any comparisons with

689
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,720
cbg isolate or cb have you been able to

690
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,158
do those type of comparisons and did

691
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,000
what did you find

692
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,080
i know it's different like from plants

693
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,640
from the plant yes the comparisons yeah

694
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,720
so we did and they're they're similar

695
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,278
they're they're basically the same

696
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,519
thank you yeah well it but i'll use the

697
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,558
caveat as long as it's a high purity

698
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,158
plant

699
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,398
isolate yeah

700
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,399
yeah

701
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,038
