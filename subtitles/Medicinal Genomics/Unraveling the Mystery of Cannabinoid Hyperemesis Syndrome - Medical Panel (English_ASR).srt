00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
thank you and uh thanks for sticking

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,000
around for the last panel of the day of

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,140
course we're gonna be talking about

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,960
cannabinoid hyper and Mesa syndrome

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,638
today this is something that has come up

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,740
in the media quite a bit they say there

7
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:15,388
are no deaths from cannabis but

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,070
ultimately this is one of those things

9
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,559
where sometimes the complication

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,899
complications of cannabis use can result

11
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,099
in death and it is a really sad thing

12
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,589
that we see out there it doesn't happen

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,118
with very many faults but it is

14
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,939
something that is continuously coming up

15
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,980
and so we have some esteemed panelists

16

for the last six years I was the senior

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:07,590

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:09,030

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,829
this short and painless for you and not

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,040
induce a mises my name is Tom fallen I'm

30
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:22,140
a board certified diagnostic radiologist

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,090
who has established a canvas canvas

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,099
medicine practice with a focus in

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,180
glioblastoma patients and I'm happy to

34
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:37,228
be here to talk to you about canvas

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:38,700
hyperemesis hi everyone I am alice moon

36
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:41,549
and I've been in the cannabis industry

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,560
for eight years and we are here right

38
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,270
now because I have cannabinoid

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,060
hyperemesis syndrome which means

40
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:51,719
basically cannabis makes me violently

41
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,118
ill so CH s is a condition to be

42
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,548
believed to be a side effect of frequent

43
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,069
and long term cannabis use and the side

44
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,100
effects include nausea vomiting and

45
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,779
abdominal pain so today I'm going to

46
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,059
tell you guys my story and hopefully

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,200
it'll inspire you guys to help me find a

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,868
cure for this

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,199
so I have been in the industry for eight

50
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:16,020
years and I when I was working at a

51
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,810
dispensary in 2015 I was writing product

52
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,330
reviews so I would consume edibles and

53
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,539
write about it so I was having about 10

54
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,480
milligrams of edibles a day and then in

55
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:30,269
2016 I started throwing up and at first

56
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,369
it was pretty random every few months I

57
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,230
would just puke and couldn't figure out

58
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,849
why I felt normal

59
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:38,729
and doctors couldn't figure out why

60
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:42,989
either they said I had acid reflux so I

61
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:44,789
changed my diet kept getting worse then

62
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,349
I stopped drinking alcohol even though I

63
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,239
wasn't drinking a good amount I thought

64
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,939
maybe that has something to do with it

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,879
and I didn't have alcohol for two years

66
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,699
and during that time I was getting worse

67
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,590
and worse to the point where in 2018 I

68
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,399
was starting to throw up almost every

69
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,349
day I saw a specialist who said it's

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,180
cannabis and I didn't want to believe it

71
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,219
I'm sure most of you don't want to

72
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,739
believe it because we know that cannabis

73
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,389
helps with not sure so how could

74
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,780
something that helps us with so much

75
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:18,389
also do damage so I said okay I'll take

76
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,449
a cannabis break but first I'm gonna

77
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:24,809
have my last hurrah so I went to a

78
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:27,689
five-course infused dinner and that

79
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,439
triggered my first episode of 14 days of

80
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:33,359
non-stop throwing up all day every day

81
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:37,530
now at this time I knew nothing about

82
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:40,620
CHS and I felt like I was dying I just

83
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,319
wanted it to end I didn't know what was

84
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,620
happening it was just throwing up over

85
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,560
and over and over and over even a sip of

86
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,269
water I was throwing it up now the

87
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,060
interesting thing with this syndrome is

88
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,359
the one thing that stops the throwing up

89
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,340
is hot baths or capsaicin cream on your

90
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:02,280
stomach now that's a cayenne pepper

91
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,709
based cream so I first tried this cream

92
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,719
not knowing what it was put it all over

93
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,689
my stomach and then my skin was on fire

94
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,609
so I was in excruciating pain but I

95
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,989
wasn't throwing up so it was like okay

96
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,420
what do I want to I want to have my skin

97
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,970
on fire don't be puking ultimately I

98
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,310
chose the puking because it was too much

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,260
and so then I was in the bathtub and

100
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,509
trying out the bathtub route and that

101
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,670
helped a lot but it dehydrated me as

102
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:30,000
well and the second I would get out of

103
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,920
the tub I was throwing up so I slept in

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,660
my bathroom on my bathroom floor for

105
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,069
many of nights my roommate will come

106
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,890
home and check to make sure I was even

107
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:40,050
alive I passed out in my front yard one

108
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:42,539
day because I was throwing up so much

109
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,340
that I couldn't hug the toilet and a

110
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,680
neighbor stopped by and said can I help

111
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,359
you and I just broke down and cried and

112
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,550
said I wish you could I wish somebody

113
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,420
could help me I don't know how anyone

114
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,430
can and you know I I felt like I was

115
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,629
dying everyone around me was extremely

116
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,990
scared I lost 15 pounds and so then I

117
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,800
quit using cannabis for three months now

118
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,079
people were saying they thought that

119
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,069
this was pesticides so after taking a

120
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:14,310
three-month break I said okay let me use

121
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:16,529
pesticide free cannabis try that and it

122
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,199
came back that time it only lasted four

123
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:21,869
days so not as terrible but still not

124
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,079
very pleasant then after that people

125
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,540
were saying CBD try CBD I'm sure CVD

126
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,969
will work for you right like it has the

127
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,150
opposite effect it'll it'll totally work

128
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,360
okay

129
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:35,729
I tried CBD and that ended up triggering

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,009
my worst episode yet it was on December

131
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,980
22nd so I didn't get to enjoy Christmas

132
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:45,029
or New Year's I threw up all day every

133
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:47,250
day for 16 days I had to urgent care

134
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:49,649
visits one at home nurse visit and

135
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,990
ultimately was in the hospital and was

136
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,399
in there for four days and you know my

137
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,540
ER doctor didn't even know the

138
00:05:53,399 --> 00:06:00,269
difference between THC and CBD isn't

139
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,919
that [ __ ] ridiculous like excuse my

140
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:03,959
language but that is absolutely

141
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,180
ridiculous that an ER doctor wouldn't

142
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,039
know the difference so they can't even

143
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,949
you know know that cannabinoid

144
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,500
hyperemesis is real and in that process

145
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:15,899
I got two ulcers a hernia and a

146
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,668
bacterial infection now I'm proud to say

147
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,949
that I've gained 30 pounds since my

148
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:22,500
hospitalization and I think that really

149
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,740
speaks volumes to how much weight I lost

150
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,329
in the beginning of the year it was

151
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,300
extremely

152
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:31,609
Carrie and I was near death and I don't

153
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,180
want anyone else to go through what I

154
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,919
went through and what's pretty crazy is

155
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,959
I was looking to see you when was the

156
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:42,079
last time I had THC when was that last

157
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,628
episode and I realized that September

158
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,109
24th of last year was actually the last

159
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:50,539
time I had THC so I I think it's pretty

160
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:54,530
serendipitous that right now is my one

161
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:56,449
year anniversary of no THC now I want to

162
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,138
be clear that I was like one of you

163
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,460
before

164
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:03,769
cannabis is my life I love Mead so so

165
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:05,258
much it is my whole entire world I'm a

166
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:07,939
publicist in the cannabis industry

167
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:10,729
before I got sick I was going to three

168
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:12,529
to five events a week it's my life and

169
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:15,709
now I can't even be around secondhand

170
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:16,758
smoke so now I am determined to find a

171
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:19,939
cure for this

172
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,919
no one's researching it and I I want us

173
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,050
to figure it out so no one else has to

174
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,258
get this sick and so I can smoke weed

175
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,259
again

176
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:36,319
[Applause]

177
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,300
Thank You Alice also for sharing that

178
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,098
story it really kind of create a gift

179
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,259
some color to what we're dealing with

180
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:44,750
out there in terms of this condition I

181
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,189
do want to mention that there is not a

182
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,228
lot known about this condition currently

183
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:50,838
so I will advise that not all the

184
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:52,068
panelists have every single answer but

185
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:54,379
we're gonna do our best to tackle it

186
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:55,819
today with this discussion so I guess

187
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:58,189
I'll start with first question I have

188
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:00,528
for the panelists and that is so the

189
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:04,550
first cases of this started to emerge in

190
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:06,250
around 2004 and it's taken a while for

191
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,569
the medical community to actually

192
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,338
acknowledge and recognize this condition

193
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:11,718
in the first place so I'm hoping to get

194
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:13,579
some insights for our panelists as far

195
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:15,110
as why you think that is why is that the

196
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:18,050
medical community has taken so long to

197
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:22,759
actually recognize this condition I'm

198
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:24,560
sure so thanks again to Alice for

199
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,968
sharing her story it takes a lot of

200
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,649
courage to come to a conference like

201
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:29,269
this where basically people are

202
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:31,098
celebrating a certain thing and you've

203
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:33,049
had this terrible experience with it and

204
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:33,649
just you know to kind of confirm what

205
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,359
she's saying

206
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,549
I remember as a first-year resident in

207
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,080
Chicago

208
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,778
was the first time I ever heard of this

209
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,310
I had graduated medical school aunt

210
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:44,259
Alice's point had never even heard of

211
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,549
such a thing and I remember at Cook

212
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:47,830
County in Chicago where we doing my

213
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:49,419
training the ER doctors were you know

214
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,889
ordered to CT scan there like that's

215
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:53,649
gonna be negative we see this kid every

216
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:55,480
few months he smokes cannabis they CT

217
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,159
scans never show anything and of course

218
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,980
the tax payer is picking up that bill

219
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,899
he's picking up all that radiation for

220
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,600
something that we now know to kind of

221
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:06,220
screen for and look for in patients

222
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,980
coming in who endorse a history of

223
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,990
chronic cannabis use with this nausea

224
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,060
and vomiting so - Kyle's question the

225
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,690
first cases showing up in 2004 that's

226
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:16,599
correct

227
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:20,110
that was from Allen at Al in Australia

228
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,329
in a case of nine patients who endorsed

229
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:25,419
a history very similar to what Alice has

230
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,949
talked to us about and upon cessation of

231
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:30,039
cannabis I believe seven of those

232
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,649
patients had complete recovery and so

233
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,240
this was the first time this began

234
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,339
percolating the surface of the medical

235
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,919
consciousness does that mean that we

236
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:42,130
haven't had cases of CHS or so-called

237
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,899
CHS at least prior to 2004 no it does

238
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:46,149
not but of course in radiology we have a

239
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:49,240
very famous saying which says the eye

240
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:52,360
does not see what the mind does not know

241
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,649
so if you are you could be looking at

242
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,909
patients all day long who are throwing

243
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:56,110
up if you don't know that there's an

244
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:59,319
entity called cannabis hyperemesis

245
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,209
syndrome which involves trpv1 receptors

246
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,120
that we'll get into in cb1 receptors

247
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:07,119
you're not going to even know they took

248
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,100
me on your radar and another point we'll

249
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,850
get into is there's a second into the

250
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:16,540
call CBS of course is very non confusing

251
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:18,399
CBS CHS cyclical vomiting syndrome these

252
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:20,860
patients will typically have the exact

253
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,078
same presentation nausea vomiting

254
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,000
abdominal pain except that a good

255
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:27,669
percentage of them as well will also

256
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,120
endorse a history of migraine they tend

257
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:33,458
to be more a female than male which is

258
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,209
the opposite with CHS and then we don't

259
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:40,929
quite see the striking use of a hot

260
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:43,000
water bathing that we do see in CVS but

261
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:44,588
the reason I'm mentioning these are CHS

262
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,750
that are with CHS let's a Thank You

263
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:50,760
Ellis at the point being that there's an

264
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,620
awful lot of overlap and so

265
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,029
in fact one of the latest papers I read

266
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,409
from May of this year actually thinks

267
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:02,620
that CHS may be a particular subset of

268
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:04,839
CVS and so just bringing this up in the

269
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,560
context of this question because CVS was

270
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,850
known before 2004 okay so I think these

271
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,649
are some of the factors and then maybe a

272
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,960
final factor that people like to talk

273
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,000
about is this increase in potency we now

274
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,400
have concentrates and other forms of

275
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,429
cannabis that are you know ninety

276
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,250
percent THC and Beyond and that perhaps

277
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:27,669
this Bombardier receptors over time at

278
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:31,750
this level could potentially account for

279
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:37,299
the increase in prevalence of these

280
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:38,679
cases and also people are now admitting

281
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:41,079
to their doctors that they're using

282
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:42,819
cannabis um you know a lot of people are

283
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,910
afraid to talk about it so doctors

284
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,440
wouldn't even know like if someone's not

285
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:49,569
you know they just don't know so now

286
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,000
that states are legalizing and cannabis

287
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,370
is a hot topic and a lot of emergency

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,899
room doctors in like Colorado they know

289
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,450
about this now they're documenting yet

290
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,220
and there's been cases of this all over

291
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,710
the world I have talked to thousands of

292
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,240
people with ths all over the world

293
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,120
people have it it's just no one's

294
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,399
keeping track of it and no one's really

295
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:15,610
putting forward the effort to talk about

296
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:18,579
it I think the same as my colleagues I

297
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,470
tried since the morning to check the

298
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,560
numbers and I was you know number which

299
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,710
was a surprise to me with almost between

300
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:30,009
200 to 300 cases they take I mean all

301
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:33,610
the hospitals together in Israel but let

302
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:36,340
me refer to something because I would

303
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:39,610
like to see things in larger scale this

304
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,450
is only one of the syndromes connected

305
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,810
to cannabis

306
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:48,060
they are underreported we don't have a

307
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:51,789
good report system or about side effects

308
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:53,889
then when we don't have the system we

309
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:56,860
cannot publish results and the physician

310
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:59,710
does not know about it in a magazine or

311
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,450
so I really the beginning should be

312
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,009
teaching teaching physicians at the

313
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,170
incision again

314
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:07,419
and just to build upon dr. Dores points

315
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:09,399
it's a great point how we gathered the

316
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:11,199
data and how we're characterizing things

317
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,970
is very important so when we say

318
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,800
someone's a heavy user what does that

319
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,200
mean is that four times a week is that

320
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,819
twice a week these things matter and so

321
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,070
another point that I'll raise is that

322
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,170
the current Bible of Gastroenterology is

323
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,930
known as the rome 4 so in you know

324
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,879
psychiatry we have the dsm-5 which is

325
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:31,209
the Bible and that contains cannabis use

326
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:33,669
disorder the rome 4 contains CH s

327
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,639
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome but

328
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:38,709
even that has an imperfect tool for use

329
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,350
and this paper that I just read from May

330
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,690
of this year suggests improvement upon

331
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,269
this so that when a patient has stopped

332
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,260
using cannabis for a period of six

333
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:52,090
months and has had complete cessation of

334
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:53,860
these symptoms they're proposing that we

335
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,139
use that six month period because their

336
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,129
own for didn't give any time period so a

337
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:02,019
patient could stop for a month and you

338
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:03,460
know not have any symptoms and then go

339
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:05,409
back on cannabis and then if symptoms

340
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,750
again so the point is that even with

341
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:10,480
this entity how we're diagnosing is and

342
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:14,590
who we're going to include is is

343
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,240
evolving all the time and it's as well

344
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,830
it should be because the major points

345
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,019
that if you've been off for a month that

346
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,460
actually isn't long enough to be able to

347
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:24,009
tell if you're going to have another

348
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,629
cycle so the proposal is that even the

349
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:28,799
room for criteria aren't good enough

350
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:32,250
that we need to be iterating on that and

351
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,250
editing as we go along

352
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:39,040
dr. Georges said since this morning when

353
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,840
he just did a few simple phone calls he

354
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,049
discovered that there's 300 people in

355
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,700
Israel that they have documented I am at

356
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,979
the end of this presentation we are

357
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,690
going to be going over and I have talked

358
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,860
to 200 people well I've talked to

359
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,830
thousands of people but I have

360
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,149
statistics from 200 people and we will

361
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,790
be going over the data that I have

362
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:00,159
collected and so this just shows how

363
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:01,929
widespread this really is and it's a lot

364
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:07,209
bigger of a deal than we're currently

365
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:10,000
acknowledging it to be so we spoke a lot

366
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,370
here about basically what are the issues

367
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,289
in terms of how people are identifying

368
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,528
this so because there seems to be this

369
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:18,240
kind of confusion among practitioners

370
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:19,740
is how to actually make this diagnosis

371
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,220
what would you say would be the best

372
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:27,899
approach to actually make a confirmed

373
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,819
diagnosis of CHS sure so I kind of spoke

374
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,159
about it in my prior answer but I'll go

375
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:34,110
to it again a modified version of the

376
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,318
Rome 4 is the best criteria we would

377
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,058
currently have so that requires that you

378
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:42,748
have a history of using cannabis for at

379
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:45,120
least one year that what they're

380
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:48,240
defining heavy user frequent use is

381
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,909
greater than four times per week there

382
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,769
they didn't give a defined time period

383
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:56,999
for cessation of cannabis and resolution

384
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:58,528
of symptoms so what then castithan I

385
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:01,920
believe the papers from from May of this

386
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:04,679
year is proposing is that you wait for a

387
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,549
period of six months after a cessation

388
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:11,248
of use or three cycles of hyperemesis so

389
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:13,258
if that patient would on average go into

390
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:15,749
a hyper Ematic phase every five weeks

391
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:18,629
then at fifteen weeks after cessation of

392
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:20,670
use you could now apply that diagnosis

393
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:22,259
retrospectively and the reason this is

394
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:23,938
very important if we want to get the

395
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,129
point out that someone shouldn't be

396
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:28,409
walking into the emergency room saying I

397
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:30,480
use cannabis and I'm throwing up and I

398
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:33,958
get relief from showers and then having

399
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,069
that label applied to them because what

400
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,198
they're finding is that a good

401
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:38,669
percentage of patients who have CVS the

402
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,308
cyclical vomiting syndrome and

403
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:43,558
psychogenic vomiting and other forms of

404
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:46,198
nausea and vomiting also find relief

405
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:47,759
from hot bathing not at the high

406
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,909
percentages that we're seeing being

407
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,430
reported in association with CHS but

408
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:55,799
certainly it is there so again I want to

409
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:59,458
harp on that six month and or three

410
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:02,338
cycles of hyperemesis that from the time

411
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:06,418
you've stopped and that brings us to our

412
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:08,159
next caveat CVS patients and CHS

413
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,649
patients up until they develop these

414
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:12,120
symptoms are RC CVS patients use

415
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:14,519
cannabis actually to treat their

416
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,500
cyclical vomiting and so they don't want

417
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,179
to stop and so trying to tell these

418
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,529
people to stop for a period of six

419
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,939
months what ends up happening is they

420
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:22,078
don't stop and maybe they don't tell

421
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,880
their doctor about it because they don't

422
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,428
want the doctor to get angry at them and

423
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,030
so this paper then goes on to talk about

424
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:30,920
how if the patient doesn't stop

425
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:33,109
and has used for greater than a year and

426
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,110
has used greater than four times a week

427
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:38,719
that a tentative diagnosis of CHS can be

428
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:40,369
applied in that case but again I will

429
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,500
point out that this paper was very much

430
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:45,669
in one case series where they looked at

431
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,869
when they applied Rome for criteria

432
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,490
retrospectively they found that a good

433
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:52,099
percentage of patients who had been

434
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,980
labeled with CHS in the emergency room

435
00:17:52,099 --> 00:18:03,949
no longer fit the criteria for that

436
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:06,920
diagnosis one more consultation I did

437
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:15,140
today who was I as Professor Michelin

438
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:20,650
that is our guru and his his give such a

439
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,650
patient not THC I said I wouldn't

440
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:30,529
cannabis and it's just he is he knows so

441
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,960
much but this is something that people

442
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:35,299
don't know about it no people don't know

443
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,319
about this we're gonna we need to have a

444
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:38,299
chat with him I know he's not gonna

445
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:41,750
plane to it is real but we're gonna have

446
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:43,519
to have a channel for sure but yeah the

447
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,119
next question that you're gonna go over

448
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,980
was the treatment once we go get this

449
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,289
yeah so I mean we've made a diagnosis

450
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,339
now so what are the first lines of

451
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:54,829
treatment that you would actually

452
00:18:52,339 --> 00:19:00,199
propose to give to someone who has been

453
00:18:54,829 --> 00:19:02,210
formally diagnosed with CHS so capsaicin

454
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,319
cream on the stomach that helps that

455
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,539
relieve the symptoms

456
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:09,049
well that relieves symptoms for a lot of

457
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:11,930
people and then the antipsychotic

458
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:14,899
medicine algal that has had a high

459
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:18,019
success rate of stopping the nausea and

460
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,330
vomiting but the side effects of it are

461
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,009
so severe that the people I've spoken

462
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:23,779
with have all said they would rather be

463
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:26,920
vomiting because it's an anti-psychotic

464
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:29,509
it has caused a lot of anxiety

465
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,920
hallucinations and people don't

466
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:33,410
understand what's going on with them

467
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,789
because most of the time doctors aren't

468
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,860
explaining the medicine that they're

469
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:37,909
giving to them and so all of a sudden

470
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,709
someone's going through like this

471
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,670
feeling of psychosis in the emergency

472
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,819
room and they don't know why

473
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:48,180
so really the only thing is like for

474
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:55,079
people to stop using cannabis but an IV

475
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:56,400
and capsaicin and that would be yeah so

476
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,470
Alice brings up a great point with

477
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,030
capsaicin in fact some people you figure

478
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,589
this could kind of be diagnostic so you

479
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:04,740
come into the emergency room you endorse

480
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:06,119
a history of cyclical vomiting and using

481
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,890
cannabis and they rub a little on your

482
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,359
chest and abdomen if you start to get

483
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,860
better they shouldn't apply the

484
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,929
diagnosis right then and there but it's

485
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:14,399
kind of a presumptive a little bit

486
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,980
because as we're going to talk about

487
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,220
probably a little bit the receptor where

488
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,200
we were initially focused on was cb1 as

489
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,269
things have evolved and we've learned

490
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,210
more about this need for nosey cept of

491
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:29,940
heat above 41 to 43 degrees centigrade

492
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,829
and our the use of capsaicin we focused

493
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,490
on the so called capsaicin receptor

494
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:37,019
trpv1 and so that's why that can be

495
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,660
helpful but in some patients it's not

496
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,069
that's why I was mentioned why would we

497
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,900
give an antipsychotic such as

498
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:45,119
haloperidol common name is Haldol

499
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,090
because guess what our ondansetron

500
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,699
are a five ht3 drug that works in our

501
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:52,740
our chemotherapy patients famously does

502
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,299
not work in this case a Reglan our

503
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,759
metoclopramide which is another

504
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,619
medication that we will use for various

505
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,379
patients with nausea and vomiting

506
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:03,269
also doesn't work universally now in an

507
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,040
emergency room you know your average IDI

508
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:06,150
physician are going to try and go to

509
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,700
these things before they go to

510
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:10,560
haloperidol typically because

511
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,630
haloperidol can cause tardive dyskinesia

512
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,519
that famous lip-smacking and other

513
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,960
things that dr. Michelle I'm talk about

514
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:18,480
yesterday in his talk on schizophrenia

515
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,039
where he was saying hey we could use CBD

516
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,200
in many of these patients and avoid

517
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:24,059
these nasty side-effects and of course

518
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,059
the other issue being that some patients

519
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:31,559
develop this tardive dyskinesia from the

520
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:33,539
very first administration so you know ER

521
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,429
doctors don't take it lightly to

522
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:37,559
administer this but the other thing that

523
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:39,720
I will mention is that haloperidol works

524
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,159
so well that when it stops the nausea

525
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,829
and vomiting in this case as well that's

526
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,870
another sign that that's potentially

527
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:48,329
what we're looking at but again bear in

528
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:49,949
mind that six months three cycles before

529
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:52,369
you're applying that label which will

530
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,350
now stay with that patient for life

531
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:56,178
and of course I sorry I should all toast

532
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:57,798
famous to say biggest things Basics in

533
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,778
medicine get fluid into these patients

534
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:01,940
they are throwing up so the initial

535
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,599
treatment in the emergency room is IV

536
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,240
fluids

537
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:07,428
sometimes benzodiazepines to sedate the

538
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,599
patient to take them away from this

539
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:11,480
hellish experience they're having

540
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:13,699
getting fluids into them stopping the

541
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,370
emesis by any of the methods that we can

542
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,288
I've mentioned 5h t3 I've mentioned

543
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:21,349
dopamine antagonists haloperidol

544
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:25,009
so emesis is a very complex mechanism

545
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:28,250
and we will try any in all of our drugs

546
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,629
to shut it down and percent prevent

547
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,140
patients from going into acute renal

548
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:37,190
failure which has happened and acute

549
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,950
renal failure kills you again and so

550
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,870
just so you know there happens at CHS

551
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,330
but we can get towards that towards the

552
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:48,759
end you mentioned that been in the

553
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:53,869
morning and I wonder they dish in from

554
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:58,419
CHS must be because of the iteration and

555
00:22:53,869 --> 00:23:03,168
I find it hard to believe in the 21st so

556
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:05,630
that not know to treat the iteration

557
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:08,270
unless those patient didn't come to the

558
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,520
hospital heard the problem dr. door and

559
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:12,168
this was a you know Alex parents and who

560
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:14,569
I'm sure is known and loved to all of us

561
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:16,070
in this room recently our last week was

562
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,950
publishing a case Mindy Anna where a

563
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:21,470
young guy had died with this presumptive

564
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,019
diagnosis EHS but it gets to a point I

565
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,319
talked about earlier when people had

566
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:28,668
associated cannabis with anti emesis you

567
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:30,230
coming along and telling them that this

568
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:32,210
very thing they were using is called he

569
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,730
didn't believe it his own mother was

570
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,440
there crying he kept on using and he

571
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,399
didn't believe it he tried stopping but

572
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,990
he went back to it

573
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:41,298
so I you know I don't want to blame

574
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,819
patients here but we're all humans and

575
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:44,960
it's human nature so that's why it's

576
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:46,759
important that we're having these

577
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,220
discussions and raising this awareness

578
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,839
and absolutely in the 21st century to

579
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:55,120
think that someone dies from dehydration

580
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:55,119
but unfortunately this is what happens

581
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,558
and some you know some people are afraid

582
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:01,699
to even go to the hospital and some

583
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,440
people can't afford to even go to the

584
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,250
hospital mean my urgent care visits were

585
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,250
expensive and

586
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:11,930
I have insurance you know is it this

587
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:17,839
syndrome has cost me a lot of money I'm

588
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:21,680
going to change the system so I do want

589
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,879
to ask about so treatment right so we

590
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,580
talked about different drugs that can be

591
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,380
used to treat it but we're also hoping

592
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,879
to understand what can we use otherwise

593
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,380
less supplements things like that what

594
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,000
what other activities can we use to

595
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,360
mitigate the symptoms of si-jess and

596
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,769
then also are there any types of

597
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,439
triggers that you've noticed of course

598
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:40,879
we know a cannabis is a trigger and not

599
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,410
just looking at the THC as Alice

600
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,260
mentioned she also had an episode with

601
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:48,019
CBD and there may be other cannabinoids

602
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:50,059
duplicated as well but specifically what

603
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,250
kind of triggers alcohol out there then

604
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:54,139
also what other types of strategies have

605
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:57,440
you been using to mitigate aside from

606
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:00,290
the drug that Tom had mentioned well one

607
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,140
interesting thing is running helps a lot

608
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:04,490
of people stop throwing up and there's

609
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,280
one reported case of somebody getting

610
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:11,870
rhabdomyolysis from running for 15 hours

611
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:14,059
straight 15 hours but he wasn't throwing

612
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:15,889
up and so I thought that was pretty

613
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:18,259
alarming so you know I reached out to my

614
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:21,530
network of people with CHS and we'll go

615
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:25,339
over the stats later but 20 people out

616
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:27,589
of the 200 found relief from running so

617
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:29,929
that is another thing that people have

618
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:34,220
found relief from some people are taking

619
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:36,410
vitamins I personally I don't have any

620
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,710
like I just I don't use campus at all so

621
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:43,519
that's kind of how I try to deal with it

622
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,509
and yeah just to build on what Alice to

623
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,129
say in case any of you were wondering

624
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,809
well how could running how does running

625
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,140
tie in to this this all gets back to the

626
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:54,079
TR PV receptor and what they think is

627
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,930
going on here is a cute aeneas steal

628
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:59,480
syndrome where basically you're having

629
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:02,140
dysfunction with cb1 receptors at the

630
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,880
level of the bowel and when you

631
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,000
put yourself under a hot shower and get

632
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,710
that 4143 degree temperature hitting the

633
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,680
TRP verse receptors which have been

634
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:14,620
desensitized they now open up and allow

635
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,450
you to feel the anti emesis or a normal

636
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:18,219
level of just functioning but

637
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,529
interestingly when they patients run

638
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,839
you're doing the same thing our I should

639
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:24,369
have said there is when the when you're

640
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,649
in the shower all of your blood is

641
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:28,750
flowing to your skin to release heat so

642
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,430
it's pulled away from the bottle they

643
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,930
think that the mechanism underlying the

644
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,340
running is that when these patients are

645
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,799
running all of their blood is now going

646
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:38,319
to their muscles and not to the bowel

647
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:40,000
so this cutaneous steal our enteric

648
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,250
steal syndrome and again this is all

649
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,549
hypothesis but this is the current best

650
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:49,210
understanding of why this occurs and as

651
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:51,460
far as triggers well there's a quite a

652
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:54,069
few foods that people can't eat if they

653
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,590
have CHS now not everyone thankfully

654
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:59,529
these foods don't affect me but black

655
00:26:56,589 --> 00:27:00,429
pepper coffee and chocolate they have

656
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:02,410
naturally-occurring

657
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,440
cannabinoids in them and it can trigger

658
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:07,180
someone to have an episode of CHS some

659
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,370
people literally cannot touch black

660
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,140
pepper at all now imagine trying to go

661
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:12,429
out to eat at a restaurant and it's

662
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,090
trying to ensure that your food doesn't

663
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:18,400
have black pepper that's not easy yeah I

664
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:21,129
think those are the few the most popular

665
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,440
foods that are the triggers for it thank

666
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,360
you even there's no and of course that

667
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,269
makes sense with beta Coughlin's having

668
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,549
cannabinoid activity in black pepper and

669
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:32,289
as I was pointed out that cannabinoids

670
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:36,519
and cannabinoid like substances in

671
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:38,829
chocolate so Alice has mentioned you had

672
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,170
mentioned that basically if some of

673
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:44,109
these episodes were up to 16 days from

674
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:46,170
you and so even after sustaining any

675
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:48,609
type of cannabis smoke or an ingestion

676
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:51,970
those symptoms still continue to persist

677
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:53,859
so I'm wondering why is it that it takes

678
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,960
so long for these symptoms to clear up

679
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:59,019
do you guys have any insights as to why

680
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,880
that might be I think you can say it

681
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:02,349
better than I can I know it's THD just

682
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,130
you know it stays in your system it's

683
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:08,439
great life so the same reason that you

684
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,210
can get pulled over by a cop after not

685
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,340
having smoked for three and a half weeks

686
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,529
and now you have to submit to EU tox and

687
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:15,459
now it turns out positive is the exact

688
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,398
same reason that they

689
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,740
hypothesize this occurs for many months

690
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,028
are sometimes after cessation and why

691
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,528
they want you to go to that full six

692
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:25,419
month period or three cycles before

693
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:28,058
applying this diagnosis the lip

694
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:30,640
lipophilic nature of cannabinoids and

695
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:32,408
cannabinoid metabolites and that these

696
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,679
are being leached into the system at a

697
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:41,710
quantity sufficient to continue to cause

698
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:43,269
illness in these patients all right so

699
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,819
this is actually a question that I'm

700
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:48,398
very curious to hear panelists insights

701
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:50,500
about some folks on the internet seem to

702
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:51,989
be convinced that CHS is caused by the

703
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,640
use of pesticides on cannabis

704
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,880
specifically if identified neem oil as a

705
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,159
potential causal agent of CHS so do you

706
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,870
won't agree with this idea and if so why

707
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,740
are why not

708
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:07,898
hell no neem oil does not cause

709
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,099
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome now I

710
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:11,048
know we're not supposed to say anything

711
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:13,389
with confidence because this is still

712
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:15,129
you know as we're researching it but

713
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:18,220
I've talked to people who have grown

714
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:22,710
their own cannabis and they have DHS I

715
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:25,630
tried pesticide free weed I have DHS I

716
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,038
it's not that the symptoms are simpler

717
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,720
but they're not the same pesticide

718
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,179
poisoning does you know it can cause

719
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,490
nausea but pesticide poisoning can also

720
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:38,200
cause seizures and issues with vision

721
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:40,179
it's not it's not pesticide poisoning I

722
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,298
I got it see you know I had an episode

723
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:46,990
from hemp drive CBD that I know was

724
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:51,069
grown without pesticides circular yeah

725
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:54,548
it's not in itself a family physician

726
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:59,139
and I like things to be seen through and

727
00:29:54,548 --> 00:30:01,389
you say kiss I don't care I don't care

728
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,909
what is the exact reason I will treat

729
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,390
the patient the same intravenously and

730
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:09,520
some things against him and nausea and

731
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:12,370
at that point is emergency well as a

732
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,639
family or as a primary care physician I

733
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:18,609
don't care what was the exact reason in

734
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,480
the receptors the same the treatment

735
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,479
will be the same

736
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:29,089
yeah I would just add that we actually

737
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:31,670
also have cases of of CHS occurring in

738
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:32,779
patients using synthetic cannabinoids so

739
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:35,150
if anyone in the room who may not be

740
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:36,769
familiar one of the reasons patients may

741
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,480
choose to use synthetic cannabinoids

742
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:40,759
they may have jobs which require them to

743
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,110
get urine tested 50 percent of all jobs

744
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,019
in the United States require

745
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:47,449
pre-employment urine screening which is

746
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:50,539
ridiculous it's an entire industry but

747
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,910
suffice it to say that we have seen CHS

748
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:55,039
in those patients using these agonist at

749
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:58,070
cb1 receptors that may be even more

750
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,980
potent than THC and we have cases going

751
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:02,869
back to 2013 2014 from England and

752
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:06,410
elsewhere around the world and also to

753
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:08,599
Alice's point I know many cases here not

754
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:11,660
many cases but quite a few where people

755
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:15,039
were growers themselves and didn't use

756
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:18,710
neem oil and still developed this

757
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:22,009
syndrome and then finally Alice's point

758
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,360
dr. Ethan Russo as well has spoken about

759
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:25,190
this and how he really doesn't think

760
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,740
it's the neem oil because as Alice

761
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,870
pointed out they're not identical this

762
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,539
is not how many moil poisoning exists

763
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:35,298
are presents and when we have seen it it

764
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:37,819
doesn't persist for this period and

765
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:39,319
again we have seen this both in cases

766
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:43,240
where neem oil has not been used on the

767
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:46,639
cannabis and in synthetic cannabinoids

768
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,120
so moving towards how we get answers and

769
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,590
start to pick apart this a bit more what

770
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:53,058
approach that's been suggested to try

771
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:55,730
and further investigate this is to

772
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:58,668
sequence patient populations with CHS so

773
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,019
are there any different targets that you

774
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:01,910
think researchers might be interested in

775
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:04,009
sequencing to help tease apart what

776
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:08,210
genetic underpinnings might be present

777
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:09,470
in this condition I'll take that we've

778
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,750
discussed these beforehand so I

779
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:15,860
apologize for hogging the mic but two

780
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:19,308
things we know in CVS patients not CHS

781
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:21,619
patients we have found a gene the ry r2

782
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:23,329
gene and given that I just mentioned at

783
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:26,859
the outset of the talk that we think

784
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:29,210
potentially CHS may be a subset of CVS

785
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:31,308
we will certainly want to look at that

786
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,769
and see if that's a commonality amongst

787
00:32:31,308 --> 00:32:34,980
these individuals who are reporting this

788
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:37,379
entity and also

789
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,289
cytochrome p450 enzymes that break down

790
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:44,010
THC and its metabolites are they somehow

791
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:46,529
different in this group are they slower

792
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:48,240
metabolizers perhaps these are all

793
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:53,700
targets that we would certainly want to

794
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:56,759
evaluate so moving to some of the

795
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,039
symptoms and what we see out there what

796
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,410
we're noticing is that hormonal

797
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,200
fluctuations in women seem to also worse

798
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:05,850
in the symptoms of their CHS do we have

799
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,460
any insights as to what is going on here

800
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:10,259
why this is the case

801
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:19,048
letting the doctor take this one again

802
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:19,710
dr. dork you want to just know what's

803
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:21,179
happening

804
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,558
we know that when women are getting

805
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:24,600
their menstrual cycle is when they're

806
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,269
having the most severe symptoms this is

807
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:30,119
a reoccurring pattern when I had my

808
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:33,230
worst case of CHS it was during my

809
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:35,759
menstrual cycle and so do you know that

810
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,558
we talked about again it's going to be

811
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,240
along the hypothesis thing where we do

812
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,069
know there's involvement of the HPA the

813
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,750
hypothalamic pituitary access the

814
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:45,529
hypothalamus is involved in thermal

815
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:48,269
regulation we think that's gonna skew

816
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:50,058
it's to do with the fact that even every

817
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,200
month woman's migraines their

818
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:55,109
fibromyalgia all of these things may be

819
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,000
worse in the para menstrual period

820
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:58,769
relating to the effect of estrogen

821
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,660
progesterone fluctuations we're again

822
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:03,089
hypothesizing that this is having some

823
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,820
effect on our homeostatic system our

824
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:07,740
endocannabinoid system but again this is

825
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:09,719
all just hypothesis at this point and as

826
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,429
Dustin Sulak had just mentioned in a

827
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,219
prior case you know we don't have great

828
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:16,230
data yet on cannabinoids and the sex

829
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:19,849
differences but it is certainly an area

830
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:23,760
ripe for exploration and investigation

831
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:25,769
and speaking of data Alice has been very

832
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,119
active in the community on social media

833
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:29,849
and she actually runs a couple of

834
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,050
different groups to support CHS patients

835
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,299
and people who are going through the

836
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,789
condition and she's actually collected

837
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,519
she's done a patient surveys so she's

838
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:40,619
actually gotten response from now 200

839
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,809
patients with CHS all through Facebook

840
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,539
maybe a couple other sources and not

841
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:46,940
sure if it was Jo about it so again our

842
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:49,219
social media business or

843
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,960
heavy metals talk it's a really useful

844
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,878
tool and so we're going to go through

845
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,889
some of those in just a minute or so

846
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:59,058
else I will let you think really slides

847
00:34:54,889 --> 00:35:01,338
here so that should take you okay so yes

848
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:03,589
that is yeah I think elective data from

849
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:06,519
two hundred people now a lot of these

850
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:08,869
people they find me because I'm doing

851
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,269
interviews a lot I have spoken with

852
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:15,559
Business Insider Leafly Rolling Stone

853
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:18,588
and no small a few smaller publications

854
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:20,180
as well and so these people they find me

855
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:21,739
they hear about my story and then I

856
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:23,509
recommend these Facebook groups and

857
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:26,209
there's people who run other Facebook

858
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,950
groups as well it's not just me doing it

859
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,769
I can't handle all the emotional labor

860
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:32,838
to be honest so there are other people

861
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:34,670
that are helping do this and so out of

862
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:37,239
the thousands of people in these groups

863
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:48,920
I've collected data from 200 of them and

864
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:52,129
so so 75 people were using cannabis for

865
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,250
eight years before the symptoms began so

866
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:57,410
that is a high amount of people but as

867
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:01,880
you can see from that it kind of varies

868
00:35:57,409 --> 00:36:03,318
of how long people were using we're

869
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:14,180
gonna move okay musical chair so I can

870
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:16,278
see better perfect and one thing I want

871
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:18,199
to point out with this data is there's

872
00:36:16,278 --> 00:36:22,429
no consistency with anything it's all

873
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:25,848
over the place so out of how much people

874
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:26,409
consumed 55 percent used it multiple

875
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:29,660
times a day

876
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:33,798
27% used it actually all day long and

877
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:37,879
then some people used it daily and small

878
00:36:33,798 --> 00:36:40,369
amount used it once a day and the age of

879
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,670
consumers buried with 50 patients aged

880
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:47,269
21 to 25 and then there is a variety of

881
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:51,079
other ages but the 21 to 25 was the

882
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:52,788
majority of the 200 people then location

883
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:55,130
where are all these people that I'm

884
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:58,370
talking to California had the highest

885
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:01,670
amount of people 15% next

886
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:04,460
was Canada 13% the New York Florida

887
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:07,340
Washington in Australia and then there's

888
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,250
a small cases reported throughout all

889
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:13,190
the states and then in Italy and the

890
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:16,400
United Kingdom as well and I think that

891
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,289
we are seeing these stats because these

892
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,880
are where this is where people are

893
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:21,949
figuring out that they have it these are

894
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,980
states that are legalizing and so people

895
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:26,839
are figuring it out versus the illegal

896
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,490
states that it's just it's not talked

897
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,340
about and people aren't using high

898
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:34,629
potency THC they're not using as often

899
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:38,480
due to lack of being able to get it so

900
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:41,119
then the methods of using cannabis the

901
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,869
highest amount of people we're using a

902
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,309
bomb

903
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:47,329
people are smoke out of her blah abang

904
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:50,690
joints blunts in a pipe smaller amount

905
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:53,329
we're using edibles 65 people out of the

906
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:56,269
200 we're using vape pens and 61 we're

907
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:59,150
using dabs so it's kind of all over the

908
00:37:56,269 --> 00:38:04,250
place of how people were using before

909
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:07,400
they got CHS next up the symptoms as you

910
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:10,730
can see almost everyone out of the 200

911
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,619
had nausea and then following that is

912
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:17,000
the rest of the symptoms that were

913
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:20,659
occurring vomiting abdominal pain some

914
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,909
body pain diarrhea dehydration the list

915
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:27,109
goes on of awful things that people

916
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:29,869
experience with this syndrome what

917
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:33,820
provided relief hot baths and the hot

918
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:38,779
showers worked for 157 157 people

919
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:42,200
capsaicin cream 443 IV was very helpful

920
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,820
heating pads and ultimately sleep some

921
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:49,129
people were able to sleep through this

922
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:50,990
and try to get relief that way the

923
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:56,150
length of symptoms after stopping

924
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:58,729
cannabis use 22% went more than a month

925
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:02,599
of still experiencing symptoms before

926
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:04,579
they got better so imagine you stopped

927
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,380
using the one thing that you think helps

928
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:08,210
you with all of your nausea and all of

929
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,619
your pain and you stop using it and

930
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,269
you're not getting better

931
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:13,608
after a month you're gonna think it's

932
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:17,959
not cannabis so people will end up going

933
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:21,068
back to using it again so next

934
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:25,190
when asked if running provided relief

935
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:30,079
10% 20 out of the 200 of find relief

936
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:32,720
from running and then this is something

937
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,089
we hadn't talked about yet gall bladders

938
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:38,389
being unnecessarily removed since

939
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:40,759
doctors don't know about this their miss

940
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:45,650
diagnosing people and people are having

941
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:47,269
organs removed 16 people out of 200 had

942
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,889
their gallbladders removed and didn't

943
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:51,169
get better and then ultimately

944
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:54,259
discovered that this was cannabis making

945
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,358
them sick 16 people and then another 16

946
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:58,490
people their doctor suggested that they

947
00:39:56,358 --> 00:40:00,528
have their gallbladder removed and this

948
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:02,868
is out of just 200 people that have

949
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:07,539
spoken to imagine how many people have

950
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:07,539
had surgery that they didn't even need

951
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,798
pre-existing conditions and this is

952
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:18,440
something that I find very interesting

953
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:20,599
is 48.5% of the people who have CH s had

954
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,220
anxiety and you know some of them were

955
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:26,210
using cannabis for anxiety and

956
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:28,608
depression as well so a lot of people

957
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:31,818
did have pre-existing conditions and I

958
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:35,900
think this might have something to do

959
00:40:31,818 --> 00:40:37,849
with with this that our genes are I

960
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,170
don't know it's but the gun is the

961
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,818
second brain right there is more

962
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,309
serotonin in the gut job there is the

963
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:44,929
brain so that I could certainly play

964
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:46,720
into this is of course we know serotonin

965
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:49,248
is very implicated in anxiety

966
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:52,009
continue these people might be on

967
00:40:49,248 --> 00:40:54,709
medicine as well and we don't know how

968
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:57,588
medicine reacts with THC I mean there's

969
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,329
not enough research at all so medicine

970
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:01,699
and the interaction could also play a

971
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:04,400
part in this we don't know

972
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:09,199
so in summary more research needs to be

973
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,180
done and that's that's that's it more

974
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,618
research needs to be done and that's the

975
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:13,818
point of having this discussion is so we

976
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:15,289
can bring more awareness to this topic

977
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:17,210
so that people do start to investigate

978
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:18,528
this a bit further I want to give a

979
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,809
thanks to our panelists for their

980
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:25,710
participation today

981
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:27,570
sorry there are knowledge with us and

982
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,280
now I'd like to open the floor to any

983
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:36,450
questions you might have for myself for

984
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:39,420
the panelist so where are we on the

985
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:43,739
sequencing of receptors in this family

986
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:46,380
such as trip a1 trip v1 c b1 c b2 etc

987
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:50,189
are we seeing potential polymorphisms

988
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:53,340
and those in this population that's

989
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,320
that's a great question to be quite

990
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,300
honest that work hasn't been done yet

991
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,680
and that's what we're hoping to you know

992
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,780
I was actually approached no later than

993
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:02,849
today to get involved in a project that

994
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,670
will be hopefully looking at these very

995
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:08,069
things so we're just getting around to

996
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:11,099
it now but really the trpv1 receptor and

997
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:12,660
to your point the TRPA receptor hadn't

998
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:13,980
been looked at the el puntal recently

999
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:17,339
people were thinking this was all to do

1000
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:21,240
with c b1 but in the past couple of

1001
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:23,220
years as the TR pv the issue has become

1002
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:25,769
more prominent given the capsaicin the

1003
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:27,449
showering baths the running now they're

1004
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:28,769
just beginning to look at that but

1005
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:30,989
certainly that's the next work to be

1006
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:32,880
done so there's a whole vocabulary list

1007
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:35,219
of these prep receptors right that we're

1008
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,280
very much in vogue a decade ago they

1009
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:40,619
kind of you know the field is the

1010
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,170
neurobiology field has moved on because

1011
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:45,329
it was well exploited it's the cannabis

1012
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:48,570
field now that needs to come into focus

1013
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:50,400
with this so as I said there's a there's

1014
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:53,460
a large vocabulary in this to them and I

1015
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,780
wouldn't necessarily just stop at a1 v1

1016
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:59,970
Oh a hundred a hundred percent you know

1017
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,250
the endocannabinoid system is

1018
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:04,889
exceptionally complex and there's so

1019
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,420
many things you could focus on but I

1020
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:08,039
think these are good starting points and

1021
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,650
certainly to look at the rest of the TRP

1022
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:12,509
receptors as well and I'd also like to

1023
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,840
point out I'm pretty sure this is the

1024
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:17,820
first DHS panel to ever happen this

1025
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,490
isn't a topic that is talked about at

1026
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:24,960
all and so we are just now starting the

1027
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:26,939
conversation and just did two quick

1028
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,130
statistics I'll trade you the overall

1029
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,760
instance in Colorado of seeing patients

1030
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:35,579
present for nausea and vomiting

1031
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,990
0.07% this is the small issues to put it

1032
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,309
in context but it's a very important

1033
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,779
issue particularly if you are the person

1034
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:41,429
suffering from it or you know someone

1035
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,869
suffering from it the other thing to

1036
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:44,608
point out after the legalization of

1037
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:47,190
cannabis in Colorado the following year

1038
00:43:44,608 --> 00:43:48,779
they saw an 8% increase in presentations

1039
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,450
to the emergency room for nausea and

1040
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,760
vomiting so again it's only 0.07 percent

1041
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:57,000
of all of their visits but they did see

1042
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,890
that uptick so you know we owe it to

1043
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,329
ourselves to remain intellectually

1044
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:06,269
curious and to ask these hard questions

1045
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:08,880
since the trpv1 receptors are involved

1046
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:13,079
as anybody looking into using CBD a to

1047
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,539
stop the symptoms so no one is looking

1048
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,730
into anything with DHS um let me just

1049
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:21,029
make that clear is no one is doing

1050
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,920
research at all Canada has allocated 250

1051
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:25,350
thousand dollars towards the research of

1052
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,079
CHS but that is not going to start until

1053
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:30,118
next year no one is putting too much

1054
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,039
focus on this because there's other

1055
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,660
things going on in the industry and

1056
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:36,449
people don't think that this is a

1057
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:37,889
widespread problem so while we think it

1058
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:40,289
has something to do with the trpv1

1059
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:43,559
receptor we can't speak with certainty

1060
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:45,809
we don't know I will add I'm aware of a

1061
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:48,750
friend of mine in Canada who's looking

1062
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:51,690
very closely at the TRP family of

1063
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:54,000
receptors and at this thing that Alice's

1064
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:57,150
point this is more nascent knowledge and

1065
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,039
more nascent direction but but certainly

1066
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:02,599
there are people already beginning to

1067
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:04,889
look at this quite heavily because

1068
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,739
mechanistically it explains what's going

1069
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:08,759
on much better than the cv one

1070
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:10,439
predominant theory which didn't explain

1071
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,150
why only certain subsets of patients

1072
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,679
develop this there are patients who will

1073
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,119
use cannabis every day of their life and

1074
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,069
will never develop this so what we're

1075
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,960
really interested in finding out is who

1076
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:21,240
is the cohort why is it that certain

1077
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,190
people and with regard to CBD a as well

1078
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:26,219
I think the patients after they go back

1079
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,260
and try CBD and have this 16 day

1080
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:32,159
protracted period of throwing up are so

1081
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:34,320
like I'm done so any pick anymore any

1082
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,960
pick I've tried and I almost died so

1083
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,870
it's certainly a great question

1084
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:43,500
thank you two questions actually

1085
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:47,549
one about sedation you mentioned that

1086
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:50,670
that helped or at least sleeping out do

1087
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:53,220
you think sedation over a period of time

1088
00:45:50,670 --> 00:46:02,400
actually decreases the length of the

1089
00:45:53,219 --> 00:46:04,469
attack or I realize go ahead maybe I'm

1090
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,099
not tryin sir completely

1091
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:11,429
do you mean to put a patient because of

1092
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:14,009
vomiting under full anesthesia and to

1093
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:16,679
live in death for several days or weeks

1094
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:21,000
well I'm not quite sure of a sedation

1095
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:23,609
comment that the other doctor made will

1096
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,400
range exactly but might presume that as

1097
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:28,349
you sedate the person at some point they

1098
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,480
stop vomiting yes that's right

1099
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:33,000
now there's degrees of sedation and all

1100
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,360
that yes true my question was more along

1101
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,809
lines of if sleep helps and sleeping

1102
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:44,579
bills or whatever does it actually or do

1103
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:47,159
you think it could compress the kind of

1104
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:51,349
lessen the severity of the attacks like

1105
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:53,129
sixteen days might shortened or whatever

1106
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:54,449
potentially I mean I think it's a great

1107
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,160
question basically you're asking if

1108
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:58,199
someone comes in we have a hundred

1109
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:59,369
patients and we sedate them with some

1110
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:02,849
benzodiazepines

1111
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:04,859
is there a length of protracted vomiting

1112
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:06,299
shortened somehow improved by the

1113
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,579
sleeping it has a great question I don't

1114
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,019
think anyone has really looked at that

1115
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:11,519
but certainly something to keep in mind

1116
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:14,309
and I will something that just came to

1117
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,840
mind as I was talking again Ryan Moreno

1118
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:17,460
who's a pretty prominent talk

1119
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,019
psychologist emergency room physician

1120
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,659
and other physicians have recently

1121
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:25,139
started proposing keeping a registry on

1122
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:27,000
cannabis given the how much of the

1123
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:29,519
United States is now legalized cannabis

1124
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,980
and in Canada as well so toxicologists

1125
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:35,400
who are emergency medicine fellowship

1126
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:37,619
trained experts in drugs are now going

1127
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,389
to be keeping a database and asking the

1128
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:41,519
same questions every time so that

1129
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:45,629
hopefully in five years from now we will

1130
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:47,150
have much more dynamic data sure the

1131
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,740
second question had to do

1132
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:53,389
at what level won't you have in the tag

1133
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:57,109
what level stimulates another one like

1134
00:47:53,389 --> 00:48:00,589
micro doses for instance at what level

1135
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:02,720
does that kick off an attack or I mean I

1136
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:05,090
think Alice mentioned that just

1137
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:07,519
secondhand smoke would do it

1138
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:10,280
does anybody have a clue about that so

1139
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:12,619
it varies from person to person there is

1140
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,019
no consistency for you know I was just

1141
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:16,969
consuming like five ten milligrams day

1142
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:18,619
maybe smoking half a joint and to me

1143
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:21,759
that's not a lot to someone else that

1144
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:24,500
might be considered a lot so as far as

1145
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,640
using again and getting symptoms again

1146
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:30,380
it completely varies for each person

1147
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:33,469
usually after taking a break people can

1148
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:35,210
consume a little bit over you know a few

1149
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:39,109
months and then the symptoms come back

1150
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:42,679
so people do try to use it lightly well

1151
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:45,890
I mean also lightly it depends on who

1152
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:49,339
what they think but there is there is no

1153
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:51,319
consistency and one of the slides that

1154
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,460
wasn't included analysis talk today but

1155
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,809
I certainly encourage you when she

1156
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,730
releases all of it to check it out

1157
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:58,009
because it's really fascinating but in

1158
00:48:55,730 --> 00:49:00,440
that one of the slides that wasn't shown

1159
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:01,760
fifty percent of those 200 patients were

1160
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,650
able to go back and use cannabinoid

1161
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,050
products again at least per their

1162
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:08,269
reporting how much of that was true was

1163
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:09,769
it really 50% was it more like 30% and

1164
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:11,389
the other 20% did get sick that they

1165
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:12,769
didn't tell us but at least fifty

1166
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:14,629
percent are saying that they were able

1167
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:16,460
to introduce cannabis or cannabinoids

1168
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:18,289
after a certain period of cessation

1169
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,940
there now where the money is

1170
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,800
what was that period of cessation what

1171
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,900
were they using what did their genetics

1172
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,180
look like do they really have CHS were

1173
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,400
they a CVS cohort that stopped for a

1174
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:30,109
period and were given that diagnosis so

1175
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,519
these are all fascinating questions but

1176
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,500
even in talking to other pretty

1177
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,469
prominent cannabis clinicians at this

1178
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,969
event they have been noted that the same

1179
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:39,500
thing and I would also make the point

1180
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:42,379
that some people believe this only

1181
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:44,449
occurs to recreational users who dab and

1182
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:46,400
whatnot and that is not the case we also

1183
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:47,809
see this in some medical patients who

1184
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,670
may only be using for as little as a

1185
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:52,250
couple of years in some cases before

1186
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:55,730
this develops and to follow up on that

1187
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:57,250
so you said people do go back to using

1188
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:59,380
but from my dad

1189
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,630
people after taking a break did the

1190
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,550
symptoms come back it was 50% of people

1191
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:05,590
who start using again their symptoms did

1192
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:07,869
come back so 50% just to clarify that

1193
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:09,700
50% of people who took a break and then

1194
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:12,400
start using got their symptoms again so

1195
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:14,108
that's hundred people out of 200 and

1196
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,970
that alter rates the person that the

1197
00:50:14,108 --> 00:50:19,569
other 50% may have been cyclical

1198
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:21,009
vomiting syndrome where they went and

1199
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:22,450
smoked again and they didn't have the

1200
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:25,119
issue and that's kind of what this

1201
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:27,159
latest paper by then Kath asan is

1202
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,079
getting at that we really want to be

1203
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:32,079
careful here in disentangling these two

1204
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:36,460
entities and in prospectively applying

1205
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:38,679
this label of CHS just about at one

1206
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:42,699
point in you asked about second-hand

1207
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:45,879
smoking I don't believe that that will

1208
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:49,210
give the patient enough amount to

1209
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,250
influence No well you and I can go sit

1210
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,050
in a room and you can smoke a joint and

1211
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:56,019
watch how sick I get the next day

1212
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:58,599
because it can make me throw up I went

1213
00:50:56,019 --> 00:51:01,329
to a Snoop Dogg concert and that was a

1214
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:03,730
mistake so I encourage you to smoke a

1215
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:06,309
joint around me so you can see what

1216
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:08,349
happens because I am that sensitive to

1217
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:10,269
it now and trust me I wish this wasn't

1218
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:13,200
true because I love cannabis so much and

1219
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:16,690
I can't go to these events

1220
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:18,939
this means a certain point maybe there

1221
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:22,119
are some sensitive persons individuals

1222
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:27,599
it's always been like that but mostly

1223
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,599
second-hand smoking is not effective no

1224
00:51:28,949 --> 00:51:33,460
- thanks Tom young from San Francisco

1225
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:35,650
Bay Area

1226
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:38,170
a patient who was pretty much a

1227
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:40,389
recreational user he was 19 years old I

1228
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:42,010
inherited him actually but he was also

1229
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:44,769
the suffered a traumatic brain injury

1230
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:47,680
about a year and a half tho and so I've

1231
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:49,989
been a little liberal as far as not kind

1232
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,489
of lease on his use you know because it

1233
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:54,549
had sort of a mediated a lot of his

1234
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:56,259
anxiety and insomnia symptoms but for

1235
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,730
the last three weeks so actually almost

1236
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,920
a month he's been waking up every

1237
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:02,980
morning with this exact same syndrome

1238
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,200
and you know I've urine tested him

1239
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,909
I have quantified his cannabis use I've

1240
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:07,309
checked you know all the usual stuff you

1241
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:08,750
know

1242
00:52:07,309 --> 00:52:10,730
including thinking it might be a

1243
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:13,309
gallbladder very unusual for young 19

1244
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:16,070
year old man but I guess my question is

1245
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:17,690
what would you suggest algorithmically

1246
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:21,289
or you know in a differential where I go

1247
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:22,610
with this at this point I mean he needs

1248
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:24,349
to take a break

1249
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,760
ultimately and you know I think it's

1250
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:28,039
something I didn't touch on was the fact

1251
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,140
that I have had every test done on my

1252
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:31,369
body possible to make sure that nothing

1253
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:34,009
else was wrong with me

1254
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:35,960
so I encourage you to look into other

1255
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:38,060
things too and not go straight to it's

1256
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,280
cannabis but I have been poked and

1257
00:52:38,059 --> 00:52:42,739
prodded over and over and over so that

1258
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:47,060
way I knew it wasn't anything else that

1259
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:48,619
was happening there is prevalence of it

1260
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:49,909
being in the morning when people get the

1261
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:52,759
worst symptoms and I don't think we

1262
00:52:49,909 --> 00:52:54,589
touch base on that question but it is a

1263
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,870
very common thing with people who have

1264
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:58,789
CH s to feel it the worst right when

1265
00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:02,259
they wake up and Tom do you want to go

1266
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:04,610
into explaining that or just cortisol

1267
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,960
okay so when it's time to get up in the

1268
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:09,200
morning the Sun coming through your

1269
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,510
window causes your body to produce

1270
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:14,719
cortisol it's why we see more heart

1271
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:16,190
attacks in the morning we are think this

1272
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,799
is going to be due to a leeching effect

1273
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,780
from the release of Adrienne excuse me

1274
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,700
from the release of cortisol basically

1275
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,230
causing the leech of whatever retained

1276
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:27,349
metabolites and cannabinoids are in the

1277
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:30,619
system again just hypothesis but that

1278
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:33,949
would be the leaving hypothesis so yeah

1279
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:37,279
he needs to take a break needs to cease

1280
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:40,789
cannabis use for a bit to see if it was

1281
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,220
that because if he continues to use then

1282
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:45,889
it could get worse if it is cannabis and

1283
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:47,629
you know I'm not a doctor and so I'm

1284
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,150
just saying from what I've seen that

1285
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:52,039
it's best just to take a break the other

1286
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:53,930
thing I would talk about which is

1287
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:57,619
mentioned in a lot of the literature in

1288
00:53:53,929 --> 00:54:01,129
wanting to bring this entity to the

1289
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:03,589
Klint to the public's consciousness is

1290
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:06,200
that these patients run up seventy

1291
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:08,180
eighty ninety one hundred and fifty

1292
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:10,129
thousand dollars worth of medical bills

1293
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:13,669
when they could just have stopped

1294
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:15,960
smoking they are getting CT scans they

1295
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,909
are getting ultrasounds sorry Alice

1296
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,740
and I I'm a radiologist I love the

1297
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:22,379
business keep it coming but you know

1298
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:23,548
like really know okay we where I come

1299
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,619
from an art and you have to be

1300
00:54:23,548 --> 00:54:26,670
practically dying to get medical imaging

1301
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:28,650
in this country

1302
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:30,568
I've got abdominal pain run through the

1303
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:32,700
tuba truth the CT scanner that's a

1304
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:35,250
problem when a 24 year old has now had

1305
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:37,259
eight emergency room visits and eight CT

1306
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,449
scans and that didn't then develops

1307
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,720
lymphoma twenty years later these tests

1308
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:45,298
are not innocuous so in error or benign

1309
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:48,000
so I would simply say you know if you

1310
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:49,048
smoke cannabis BRR use cannabis a knee

1311
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,789
capacity cannabinoids

1312
00:54:49,048 --> 00:54:52,679
be honest with your physician if you

1313
00:54:50,789 --> 00:55:00,450
can't be honest with your physician find

1314
00:54:52,679 --> 00:55:03,528
a new one ask for cannabis after having

1315
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:07,739
such side effects and in cysts or

1316
00:55:03,528 --> 00:55:09,838
enemies then I believe that that is some

1317
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:17,639
kind of addiction and they must be

1318
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:19,739
treated in other direction I've spent 40

1319
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:22,170
plus years as an emergency physician and

1320
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:24,149
Alice have to apologize for not knowing

1321
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:27,630
anything about cannabis for 35 of those

1322
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:29,430
years I've seen an evolution though it

1323
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:31,410
seems like if you come in with nausea

1324
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:32,190
and vomiting and you so much as smell

1325
00:55:31,409 --> 00:55:34,788
the flower

1326
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:37,139
yeah there's now cannabis hyperemesis

1327
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,910
but you know I thought I had a handle on

1328
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:40,889
there's a first time I've heard that you

1329
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:45,149
actually have to have recurrent symptoms

1330
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:47,038
with CBD which I'm surprised I presumed

1331
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:49,920
that you know the association with the

1332
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:52,920
high frequent use which because we down

1333
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,990
regulate our endocannabinoid system we

1334
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,568
basically get a dysfunction acquired

1335
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:59,818
dysfunction and and so we develop these

1336
00:55:57,568 --> 00:56:01,980
symptoms and that's also why things like

1337
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:05,369
the capsaicin you know working on other

1338
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:08,460
receptors which again CBD works on the

1339
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:10,890
trip receptors why did it cause was

1340
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,869
recurrence symptoms so I definitely have

1341
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:15,449
a little more theory about you know what

1342
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:17,369
is that dysregulation in the

1343
00:56:15,449 --> 00:56:19,409
endocannabinoid system there might be an

1344
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:21,869
underlying cause of this little syndrome

1345
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:23,848
yeah so first off thank you for your

1346
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:25,420
longtime service in emergency medicine

1347
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:27,070
and you

1348
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,420
it's better to come to cannabis late in

1349
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:31,780
life that's never come to cannabis at

1350
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:36,519
all so thank you for that but what I

1351
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:38,500
would say there is why the focus is that

1352
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:40,210
what they think is going on at the TR PV

1353
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,949
receptor is they think it's been

1354
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:44,889
desensitized where we know that it

1355
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:50,230
responds to acids with a pH of less than

1356
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:53,440
6 cannabinoids nociceptive heat at 41 43

1357
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:56,500
degrees and capsaicin and the idea is

1358
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,450
that when the cannabinoids can no longer

1359
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,150
tickle that receptor Argueta to provide

1360
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:02,769
a certain tone of anti emesis that the

1361
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:05,170
patients have figured out how to

1362
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:07,239
self-medicate or how to self treat to

1363
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:08,500
achieve this and even in the case Alice

1364
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:10,839
was describing where the gentleman

1365
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,719
developed rhabdomyolysis from running

1366
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,880
for 10 or 15 hours in the hospital they

1367
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:17,019
have to ask him you know to stop running

1368
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,640
in place and there was another case

1369
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:20,230
where a patient in the hospital the

1370
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:23,079
nurses would ask him to come out of the

1371
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:24,909
shower so they could evaluate him so

1372
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:27,190
this will just tell you that when the

1373
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:29,319
dysregulation goes awry at this receptor

1374
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:30,220
these patients will do anything to the

1375
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,220
point where they're coming in with

1376
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:34,750
third-degree burns self-induced from

1377
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:49,629
staying in the shower or bath for

1378
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:51,730
protracted periods I'm not sure if I

1379
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:54,910
really have a question or not but it may

1380
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:57,070
come out like an hour like 10 minutes

1381
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:59,409
before the panel started I introduced

1382
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:01,030
myself to Alice and said hi we have a

1383
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:03,849
mutual friend by the name of Kristin

1384
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:04,240
Yoder who is on LinkedIn and Kristin

1385
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:06,909
Yoder

1386
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:09,309
was someone who actually brought this

1387
00:58:06,909 --> 00:58:11,949
particular topic to the forefront of the

1388
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:14,259
cannabis community a few months ago and

1389
00:58:11,949 --> 00:58:17,049
boy the backlash of people in the

1390
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:19,570
cannabis community instead of coming

1391
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:22,570
together and being loving there was all

1392
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:24,220
this really are you sure isn't it in her

1393
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:26,380
head are you sure was this that

1394
00:58:24,219 --> 00:58:28,839
poisoning whatever and people were

1395
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:31,630
really not very supportive so I'm here

1396
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,369
to support you Alice on your journey I

1397
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:39,849
know it has not been easy

1398
00:58:33,369 --> 00:58:42,068
I think yeah you're welcome you're

1399
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:43,660
welcome and I really appreciate from the

1400
00:58:42,068 --> 00:58:45,788
bottom of my heart how grateful I am

1401
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:47,828
that you are so vulnerable and willing

1402
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:50,319
to be so courageous to the group here

1403
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:52,390
today no matter what the size is what

1404
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:54,278
matters is moving forward and getting us

1405
00:58:52,389 --> 00:58:56,259
out to the people because there are

1406
00:58:54,278 --> 00:58:59,380
other people who are suffering and sadly

1407
00:58:56,259 --> 00:59:01,449
god forbid if you have this syndrome it

1408
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,650
doesn't sound like it's a wonderful

1409
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:05,259
thing but it sounds like there are

1410
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:07,298
options and alternatives and I just

1411
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:10,630
wanted to also say that I had my

1412
00:59:07,298 --> 00:59:13,119
gallbladder taken out but and when I saw

1413
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:15,489
that I'm like oh my gosh I really wonder

1414
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,599
but nevertheless like I said I really

1415
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:17,920
don't have a question I'm here to

1416
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:20,200
support you and thanks for everything

1417
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,829
thank you and I would like to just give

1418
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:25,509
a few final statements that the person

1419
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:27,278
she mentioned is one of my best friends

1420
00:59:25,509 --> 00:59:30,309
who has my back on the Internet

1421
00:59:27,278 --> 00:59:30,969
I do get a lot of hate for talking about

1422
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:32,559
this syndrome

1423
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:34,809
people have accused me of working for

1424
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,579
the feds people say that I'm trying to

1425
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:38,349
make cannabis illegal and I'd like to

1426
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:41,048
remind everyone that alcohol is still

1427
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:43,150
legal so this isn't a movement towards

1428
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:45,788
getting cannabis out of the hands of

1429
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:48,068
people I am a hundred percent pro

1430
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:50,829
cannabis I fully believe in the power of

1431
00:59:48,068 --> 00:59:52,929
the plants it helps so many people every

1432
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:54,670
day this is just an unfortunate side

1433
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:56,169
effect that happens you can have too

1434
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:57,999
much water and you can have too much

1435
00:59:56,170 --> 01:00:00,039
cannabis and so I just want to get to

1436
00:59:57,998 --> 01:00:01,799
the bottom of it and hopefully you guys

1437
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:03,060
can help me do that thank you

[Music]

1441
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:10,210
want to say thank you again to our

1442
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,780
panelists and thank you all for

1443
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:14,260
attending

1444
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:19,680
Kent mid 2019 and enjoy the rest of your

1445
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:19,680
evening thank you
