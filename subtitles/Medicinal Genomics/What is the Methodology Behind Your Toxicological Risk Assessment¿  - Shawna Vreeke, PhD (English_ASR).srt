[Music]

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,519
explain a little bit more about the

3
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,359
methodology behind your uh toxicological

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,679
risk assessment that you're

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:25,800
performing yeah that's a great question

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:30,480
so toxicological risk is a component of

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,879
the the unique um Hazard risk of each

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,439
ingredient coupled with the exposure

9
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:39,799
level so I always like to describe this

10
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,759
in terms of alcohol most of us are all

11
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,000
very familiar with alcohol so for

12
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:48,479
example ethanol that is the compound

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,719
that has the inherent risk in

14
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,839
alcohol and so we understand the

15
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,600
toxicity of ethanol then you compare

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,600
with with the exposure level so for

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,320
example one glass of wine

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,359
you're probably going to feel totally

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,719
fine um you'll wake up the next day feel

20
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,719
totally great go about your day no

21
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:14,000
problem so that is a very low exposure

22
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:17,118
to ethanol so the risk is very low but

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,759
then let's say you know after I do my

24
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,719
presentation I'm really excited I'm

25
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,719
going to celebrate and I drink a whole

26
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:26,200
bottle of wine so that's a much higher

27
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:29,719
exposure and while I'm drinking that

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,640
bottle of wine I might lose a little bit

29
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:35,798
of balance right I might say things that

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,280
I think are really funny but maybe not

31
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,118
be so funny um and then the next day

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,920
when I wake up I'm probably going to be

33
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:45,478
very dehydrated I might have a headache

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,960
but ultimately I have a really great

35
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:51,039
breakfast and by the end of the day I

36
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,839
feel totally fine again so the risk

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,680
between you know a glass of wine and a

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,159
bottle of wine is a little bit higher

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,159
because we're doing we're getting

40
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,399
exposed to a higher level of that

41
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,200
ethanol so that's the idea behind a risk

42
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,280
assessment because nothing and I mean

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,959
nothing in this world is 100% safe so

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,318
it's really important to understand the

45
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,640
inherent risk of that individual

46
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:20,359
component but then also to understand

47
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,958
how much of that component how much of

48
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,280
that ingredient can a consumer be

49
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,479
exposed to without having any risk or

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,840
without having any like you know the

51
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,280
risk is at a negligible

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,439
level so the methodologies that I employ

53
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,840
here at true

54
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:42,400
turpins um includes surveying all of the

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,878
publicly available data on each

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,239
individual

57
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:49,439
ingredient compiling all that reading it

58
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,519
understanding the

59
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:56,479
conclusion and then I perform a set of

60
00:02:52,519 --> 00:03:00,000
calculations which is very standard in

61
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,919
toxicology um and so these calculations

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,199
do things for example if it was a study

63
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,199
with a rat we need to understand what

64
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,399
that means in a human so I do a

65
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:14,399
calculation to put it into the levels

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,959
that a human would be exposed to then I

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,920
need to put it into the exposure of a

68
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,199
cannabis consumer right so I understand

69
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,318
how much is a cannabis consumer vaping

70
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,639
every single day how much of this

71
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,919
extract are they being exposed to every

72
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,679
day so that's a really important

73
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,679
calculation then once I get that calcul

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,959
or once I get that answer from the human

75
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,040
exposure

76
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,519
level I apply a set of uncertainty

77
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:48,318
factors or safety factors they're

78
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,840
sometimes called so what that means is

79
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:55,318
we found this limit from a study where

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,840
there was no Adverse Events to the rat

81
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:02,199
but we're not 100% sure if a rat is

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,759
totally equivalent to a human so we're

83
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:08,679
going to apply this uncertainty factor

84
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:12,280
which brings this No Effects level down

85
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,920
let's say 10 times so now it's 10 times

86
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,000
smaller limit so it's going to be more

87
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,399
conservative limit so we can be more

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,439
confident that that limit is not going

89
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,799
to cause harm to our cannabis consumers

90
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:29,038
in the final product so that's kind of a

91
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,439
brief overview of you know what a

92
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:35,120
toxicolog risk assessment is and how I

93
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,519
perform that excellent excellent so in

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,639
your example with alcohol you were

95
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:42,758
mentioning how ethanol is sort of the

96
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,120
the compound um that can cause harm I

97
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,479
guess for like of a better term so when

98
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,478
you're looking at

99
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:59,508
