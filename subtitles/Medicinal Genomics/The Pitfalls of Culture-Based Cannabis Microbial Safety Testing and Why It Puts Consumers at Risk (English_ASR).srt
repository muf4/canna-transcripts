1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,120
good morning everyone my name is Yvonne

2
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,699
and I'm a senior scientist with

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,558
medicinal genomics they let me out of

4
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:17,719
the lab this week to come and speak to

5
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,390
you guys about some data that we've

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,009
collected over the past several years

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,500
showing how culture based cannabis

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,550
microbial testing can put the consumer

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,640
at risk so this is just a brief history

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,509
of the past 350 years in micro and

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,340
molecular bio it all started back in

12
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:40,670
1767 when Van lien Hooke started the

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,969
study of microbiology julius Petri

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,730
invented the petri dish in 1887 and in

15
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:49,010
1953 we all know Watson and Crick with

16
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:52,640
the help of rosalind Franklin discovered

17
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:54,500
the structure of DNA the field of

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,439
microbiology Allah biology was

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,509
revolutionized in 1983 with Karim

20
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,699
Alice's invention of the polymerase

21
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:05,989
chain reaction or as we like to call it

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:08,060
PCR and in 2003 the human genome project

23
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:10,849
was completed after 13 a 13 year

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,159
endeavor molecular biology has come a

25
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:15,618
long way in a short amount of time today

26
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,810
we can sequence the human genome in 36

27
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:21,099
hours compared to the 13 years it took

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,509
almost 30 years ago yet in a world of

29
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:25,399
microbiology we're still relying on a

30
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:29,030
technique that's a hundred and sixty-one

31
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:31,189
years old so here are some examples of

32
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,859
your traditional culture based methods

33
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:36,649
you've got pleating gram staining

34
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:38,989
microscopy in biochemical testing they

35
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:41,000
have their advantages and disadvantages

36
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:42,559
the advantages are they're cheap they're

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,719
sensitive you can get down to single

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,659
copy single colony forming the unit's

39
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,849
sorry and they're reliable disadvantages

40
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,848
are there time-consuming it can take

41
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:54,978
days to cro grow the cultures depending

42
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:57,049
on what you're growing labor-intensive

43
00:01:54,978 --> 00:02:00,399
multiple deletions multiple plates

44
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:03,649
different incubation times and not all

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,879
microorganisms grow on or in artificial

46
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,098
media and that's an important point

47
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,750
culture based testing on cannabis

48
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:12,759
currently there's three major players in

49
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,218
in the field

50
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:19,269
3m Petri films Hardy diagnostic plates

51
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:22,000
and the biomerieux tempo cartridge

52
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,130
all these three companies have all

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,300
crossed over from the food industry into

54
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,819
the cannabis industry

55
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,010
however unlike food testing cannabis

56
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:32,139
testing has to consider various routes

57
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:34,959
of administration beyond just oral

58
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:37,929
consumption cannabis flower produces

59
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,120
high concentrations of anti microbials

60
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,550
cannabinoids turpan oh it's and thus

61
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,860
represent a different matrix than

62
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,660
traditional foods none of these have

63
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,260
been validated on a cannabis matrix

64
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:53,799
which according to multiple regulatory

65
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:56,979
bodies you have to do a new validation

66
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:00,730
once you change your matrix and the

67
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:02,759
molecular but in the molecular world for

68
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:06,369
microbial based testing you have

69
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:09,099
hybridization PCR sequencing and DNA

70
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,099
microarray in the cannabis space

71
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:15,789
molecular methods being used our qPCR in

72
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:18,879
microarray and sometimes sequencing we

73
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:22,409
at medicinal genomics focus on qPCR in

74
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,449
sequencing so what are the advantages

75
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:29,020
advantages of qPCR over plating as that

76
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:31,530
they're faster you can reserve we obtain

77
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,270
results in hours as opposed to days

78
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,879
bacteria can take anywhere between 24

79
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:40,600
and 48 hours to grow and yeast and mold

80
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,750
48 to 72 hours to grow qPCR is more

81
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,009
accurate if the primers don't bind to

82
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,289
the sequence that you're looking at

83
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:51,009
there knock the assay is not going to

84
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:53,590
work so qPCR is looking for specific DNA

85
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:56,829
sequences shared by a family of microbes

86
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,979
if the DEA and DNA isn't present qpcr

87
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,410
isn't going to detect it they're cute

88
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:04,539
PCR is more specific

89
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:09,789
if the DNA sequence you're looking for

90
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:11,620
isn't there I'm sorry if the DNA

91
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,409
sequence is known and asked they can be

92
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:21,160
designed to target that species specific

93
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:23,350
DNA this is important especially oh this

94
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,990
is important in in the case of

95
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,000
Aspergillus there are many species of

96
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,610
Aspergillus yet there are only four

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,500
pathogenic species in cannabis testing

98
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,710
and those are Aspergillus flavus who

99
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,160
goddess Niger antarious and qPCR

100
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,349
s-scared

101
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,060
scaleable everything's done in a 96-well

102
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,410
plate format and this allows for

103
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,959
automation to be used so cannabis is a

104
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,380
unique unique matrix you have flower

105
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:53,039
extracts and concentrates and MIPS which

106
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:56,110
are marijuana marijuana infused products

107
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,900
lipid-rich matrices like flower oil

108
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:02,199
concentrate in MIPS cannot be sampled

109
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:05,289
with a simple equus immersion instead

110
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,579
the lipids need to be dissolved need to

111
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,950
be disrupted so that they can be

112
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:11,139
dissolved in water to fully sample to

113
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,750
fully get an idea of what you're

114
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,149
sampling this usually requires a

115
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,949
detergent and this isn't good for

116
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,629
culture based methods because the

117
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:21,189
detergent can also break down the cell

118
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,259
wall of the microorganisms that you're

119
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,750
looking at and therefore render them not

120
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,659
viable to be growing on your media so

121
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,639
while these quick equi espress are good

122
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,120
for quick turnaround time and not having

123
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,639
to extract DNA they really um put you at

124
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,129
a disadvantage of of sampling what

125
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,689
you're truly looking at and some other

126
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:42,969
people before me have talked about the

127
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:47,250
higher how the cannabis matrix is very

128
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:50,830
hydrophobic so this is the current state

129
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:53,800
regulated regulations in the US and this

130
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:58,478
is an ever-changing map and it's kind of

131
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,819
a choose-your-own-adventure the many

132
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,728
states fall the rule reference the USP

133
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:08,079
or the AHP the main difference between

134
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:11,289
these two is that the USP calls for the

135
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:15,069
detection of Pseudomonas and staff while

136
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:17,979
the US while the AHP does not some

137
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:20,139
states choose to look for pathogenic

138
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:22,870
snake e.coli while others are just

139
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,360
looking at e.coli and then you've got

140
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,329
the BCC and California the Bureau of

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,490
cannabis control and they actually did

142
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:32,349
some research before coming out with

143
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,540
their recommendations and they have

144
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,820
species specific lists and they're just

145
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,150
looking at the organisms that actually

146
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:43,149
are harmful and pathogenic to humans and

147
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:45,649
they focus on Salmonella STEC e.coli and

148
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:48,259
in the four species of a specialist

149
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:51,829
and some other states have picked up on

150
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,779
those regulations Alaska Nevada while

151
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:56,629
they do have total counts they also now

152
00:06:53,779 --> 00:07:00,138
have Aspergillus species-specific annum

153
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:02,839
Florida and Vermont are looking into

154
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:05,509
going with those regulations now what

155
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:08,029
makes the HP and the USP regulations

156
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,829
difficult in cannabis testing is that

157
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:12,138
they all call for total tests and

158
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:14,569
totally Eastern mold and total aerobic

159
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:17,660
tests are unable to differentiate

160
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:20,659
between pathogenic beneficial and benign

161
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,750
yeast molds and bacteria and this makes

162
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,729
them poor indicators of safety a low

163
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,000
total result doesn't mean that your

164
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:31,750
sample is harmful to consumers and a

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,850
high total count I'm sorry that's not a

166
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,069
low total result does not mean a sample

167
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,020
is free of pathogens and a high total

168
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:41,990
count doesn't mean that a sample is

169
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,849
harmful can harmful to consumers like I

170
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,370
said earlier cannabis is a very unique

171
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,770
matrix and you cannot simply slap on a

172
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,709
food regulation and expect every -

173
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:54,680
everything to work so now I've got some

174
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:56,598
data to support some of this according

175
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,250
to the so Pseudomonas Pseudomonas

176
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,709
aeruginosa is a bio tolerant

177
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,439
gram-negative bacteria that's this is

178
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:06,589
important it's a bacteria according to

179
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,750
the USP there is quote no strict

180
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:11,409
definition of this group of

181
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:14,228
microorganisms well that's helpful and

182
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,610
they grow operationally as those

183
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:19,639
microorganisms that show growth in the

184
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:23,210
standard conditions on vile violet red

185
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,490
blue glucose are der so Pseudomonas

186
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,888
aeruginosa is responsible for eleven to

187
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,538
fourteen percent of hospital-acquired

188
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:32,120
infections so you don't want your immuno

189
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:35,538
compromised cannabis patient getting

190
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,179
this so we set out to look at this we

191
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:42,649
obtained two different species from a

192
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:45,919
tsetse and we grew them according to the

193
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:49,309
3m Petri film product literature 24

194
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:51,289
hours 32c and according to their

195
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:55,969
literature Pseudomonas should appear as

196
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:59,259
red colonies without gas or acid as you

197
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:02,200
can see there's no growth

198
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:04,389
we took that 1 to 100 dilution after 24

199
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,780
hours and we tested it on our Q PCR

200
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:11,080
assays our 3 Q PCR assays that can

201
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:14,009
detect Pseudomonas and as you can see we

202
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,410
were able to detect detect it now

203
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:19,029
student Monas is a bacteria yet through

204
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:21,549
sequencing studies we've performed with

205
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:23,709
their party testing labs we see it

206
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:32,379
popping hot on total yeast and mold

207
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:34,810
tests so this is gonna work no ok this

208
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:38,169
cartridge you can see the yellow growth

209
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:41,199
that Pseudomonas growing in a tempo bio

210
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:43,509
marry you yeast and mold cartridge now

211
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,879
the temple platform utilizes a pH

212
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:48,669
sensitive fluorescent dye to monitor the

213
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:51,879
growth as a decrease in pee as the pH

214
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:54,250
decreases the fluorescence results also

215
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:57,490
decrease indicating that the organism is

216
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:01,840
growing so this is a false positive

217
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:04,299
result and it's because Pseudomonas is

218
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,960
an acid producing bacteria much like

219
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:10,839
bacillus so to test this theory we

220
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,340
obtained a culture from a tsetse and we

221
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,710
grew it up it was actually a

222
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,879
chloramphenicol resistant Pseudomonas

223
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,070
and we grew it up in the presence of

224
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,279
chloramphenicol and we shipped it off to

225
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,870
two third party testing labs in

226
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:27,129
massachusetts and this is an example of

227
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:29,889
a report we got back and as you can see

228
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:33,039
it failed total aerobic as it should

229
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:35,559
Pseudomonas is a bacteria it also failed

230
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,349
the total yeast and mold test that

231
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,559
shouldn't have happened it passed the

232
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:45,310
bios tolerant gram-negative test

233
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:47,259
Pseudomonas is biotin creative so again

234
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:51,579
this is putting your consumers at risk

235
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:53,590
your you're getting a false positive on

236
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,730
something that's not even growing that

237
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,990
shouldn't be growing there and you get a

238
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,850
false negative for a biotin

239
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,620
gram-negative volatile and gram-negative

240
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,580
is type of bacteria that you don't want

241
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:06,190
growing on your plants so we've done

242
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,259
some extensive studies with with several

243
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,340
different customers and this is part of

244
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:11,840
our paper that we did with the third

245
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,570
party testing lab in Massachusetts

246
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,570
and we did some sequencing and we did

247
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,730
sequencing all of the flour before it

248
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,740
was exposed to culture and then we we

249
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,200
scraped the colonies we opened up the

250
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,990
bio marry biomerieux cartridge and we

251
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,030
extracted the DNA after culture so this

252
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,460
is back to these are some examples of

253
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:36,139
bacterial bacterial sequencing results

254
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:39,800
off of totally East and mold tests and

255
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:42,080
as you can see the blue line up top

256
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,269
that's our friend Pseudomonas growing in

257
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,710
yeast and mold and then down the bottom

258
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,539
bacillus again

259
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,519
another acid producing bacteria these

260
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:52,039
are these bacterias are growing in yeast

261
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,720
and mold cartridges and then there's

262
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,519
another little blip down there and

263
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,600
that's botulinum that's something that

264
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,179
you definitely don't want on your

265
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,300
cannabis but we think that's growing due

266
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:05,870
to the fact that these cartridges are

267
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:07,429
more in an anaerobic type state so when

268
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,060
we did this sequencing we were targeting

269
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:12,349
the 16s region of the bacteria we did

270
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,869
the same with the yeast and mold that

271
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,430
was growing on so the yeast and mold

272
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,310
assay that we have we're targeting the I

273
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:22,459
TS region and again you can see that

274
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:25,129
what the culture what the DNA is before

275
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:29,269
the gray bars is much different than

276
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:31,519
what you're seeing after culture so here

277
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:34,490
you're seeing before culture there's a

278
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,309
high level of Penicillium after culture

279
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,860
there's high levels of Trichoderma

280
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:42,229
Trichoderma are widely used in

281
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,629
agriculture agricultural industry as

282
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,120
fungicides so what's happening here is

283
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:49,850
the trichoderma is eating the

284
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,340
Penicillium so you're seeing a different

285
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,710
result after culture and it's not what

286
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,930
was on there beforehand Penicillium it's

287
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,400
also you don't want that growing but

288
00:12:56,929 --> 00:13:00,289
that's not we're looking at here and

289
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,139
then you've got Aspergillus

290
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:06,620
Aspergillus is is the one thing that has

291
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:09,710
caused a death in cannabis it's not

292
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,220
growing after culture and that's a

293
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,639
problem

294
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,889
and there's more evidence for this

295
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,100
Aspergillus grows as heterogeneous macro

296
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:21,860
colonies and that's a fancy word for it

297
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,310
grows in these clumps clumps of Canadia

298
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,889
that can be hundreds to thousands

299
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:31,899
of filamentous growth packing together

300
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:33,699
so instead of it forming nice single

301
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:35,529
colonies like you're used to seeing on a

302
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,680
bacterial plate they grow in these

303
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,839
hamburger type clumps so so you look at

304
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,639
this and you could count you know okay

305
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,100
that one maybe there's three growing

306
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,500
there and when actua actual actual

307
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,310
allottee it's probably about three times

308
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,529
as much and you get a sampling bias you

309
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:55,989
know here it is growing at the 1 to 100

310
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:57,639
dilution on the 3m Petri films but on

311
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,610
the stabbed X Agra plates there's

312
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:04,049
nothing so that's a problem the clumping

313
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:08,590
causes a sampling bias and we see this

314
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:11,379
in our Q PCR results so we obtained 11

315
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:14,740
different yeasts and molds from a tsetse

316
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:17,740
and we compared qPCR verse plating

317
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,289
methods and for 9 of the 11 organelle is

318
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,830
the 9 of the 11 organisms they match up

319
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:25,779
really well except for these two

320
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,700
Aspergillus japonicus and Aspergillus

321
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,490
flavus and they're threefold off

322
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,950
compared to what the Q PCR results are

323
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,200
and this is because Aspergillus clumps

324
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,200
and it creates a sampling bias during

325
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,520
plating and effect effectively limits

326
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,170
the dynamic range of the assay in

327
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,960
complicating the CFU program accuracy

328
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:49,179
and this is a reason why qpcr is better

329
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:54,190
able to detect Aspergillus compared to

330
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:58,419
culture so here's some more data and

331
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:00,280
this is a testing mips so e-coli was

332
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:04,689
grown up in spiked in the presence of

333
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:06,759
candy so you'll see the top is equal I

334
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:11,070
in CSV which is our control and the

335
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:15,039
bottom is TSB candy and e-coli so

336
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:17,200
according to 3m total aerobic plate

337
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:20,769
count provides total aerobic count after

338
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:26,770
48 hours and if you look after 48 hours

339
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:32,139
I really wish this 3 minutes you can see

340
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:34,600
growth and it's not until 96 hours that

341
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:37,350
the the e.coli and candy starts showing

342
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,779
up so this again would you

343
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:43,139
after 48 hours you would say oh there's

344
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:46,409
nothing present will pass this see it

345
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:49,980
again in the coliform plates again for

346
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:52,889
40 24 to 48 hours at the 48 hour time

347
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,509
plate point you can see without the

348
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:56,250
presence of candy you've got colonies

349
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:59,789
and in the presence of candy there's

350
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:02,909
nothing so this is a great picture

351
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:07,039
because this shows the importance of DNA

352
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:10,019
and how and how it can be used in

353
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,639
differentiating different species so

354
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,960
you've got your monarch butterfly it

355
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,909
goes through a huge state of

356
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,769
metamorphosis it's got the same genome

357
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:19,549
those two organisms look completely

358
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:22,049
different but they have the same genome

359
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:24,750
the different genomes those are four

360
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:27,449
different species of Aspergillus only

361
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:30,809
one of them is pathogenic only one of

362
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,430
them is harmful so if you're passing if

363
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:35,569
you're a passing limit for a totally

364
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:38,699
eastin mold test is 10,000 CF yous and

365
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,460
5000 of them are Aspergillus Niger Niger

366
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,440
the consumer is at a much greater risk

367
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,750
with a passing total yeast and mold

368
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,430
result than with a result indicating

369
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,500
failure in a species specific assay so

370
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:55,469
I'm running out of time so some of my

371
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,659
key points because culture based methods

372
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,820
can grow off target organisms this leads

373
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:02,250
to inflated counts that leads to higher

374
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,410
failure rates culture based methods

375
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,420
distort what is actually present on the

376
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,850
plant and other matrices and therefore

377
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,120
provides an accurate picture of

378
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:14,490
microbial risks molecular based methods

379
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,229
can capture specific microbial risks

380
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,390
while many of these risks fail to be

381
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,610
detected by culture based methods due to

382
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:23,280
their slow growth in these mediums and

383
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:26,369
the complexity of different cannabis

384
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,230
matrices affects the readout chemistry

385
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:30,449
and commonly used culture methods and

386
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,849
therefore given an inaccurate count of

387
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,309
the potential threats present wait a

388
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:36,959
minute

389
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,269
acknowledgments and thank you I'll be

390
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,190
available for questions aren't we can do

391
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:48,450
one quick great thank you welcome

392
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:50,490
get it excellent presentation and

393
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,620
important data I'm wondering because

394
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,069
outside of the immunosuppressed I

395
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:57,869
suspect the biggest risk to consumers is

396
00:17:55,069 --> 00:18:00,210
mycotoxins rather than Aspergillus

397
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:01,559
infection could you comment if you've

398
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,410
looked into that at all

399
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:06,990
no we currently are not doing any micro

400
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,509
toxin testing I do know that most of the

401
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,250
states require some sort of micro toxic

402
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:13,379
testing and that's being done more at

403
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,859
the chemistry level then at the

404
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,860
molecular level
