1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,720
well i come at this from a different

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,280
perspective

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,320
i'm a medical doctor you can see the

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,239
different hats

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,879
i was at 20 years i was at children's

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,879
hospital los angeles medical genetics

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,038
about 70 percent clinical

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,000
and i had a faculty appointment at the

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,439
usc medical school

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,879
i had been focusing on children

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,118
particularly with

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,439
multiple functional conditions pain

13
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,799
fatigue gi problems dysautonomia

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,479
autism and things like that and then

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,640
there's a huge number of children with

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,319
those kind of problems in any clinic and

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
anywhere in the world in fact that's the

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,558
number one reason why people have

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
disability or days off of school or work

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:48,959
is because of functional disease and

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,558
there is

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
very little research on it and realizing

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,238
that the

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,119
academic world was moving too slow on

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,198
this

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,320
joined cordage and to try to go quicker

27
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,479
into bringing

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,079
the amazing things that we can do the

29
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,158
human genome project and the new

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,039
information on genetics and genomics and

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,640
bring it to the world

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
so i'm going to be looking at it from

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,079
the perspective of a physician a

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,519
researcher and

35
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:19,920
company man of course everything is off

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,920
label

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,479
first of all it's the concept of

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,319
functional disease

39
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:32,719
functional disease caused by many labels

40
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,559
in the western world just 100 years ago

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,798
and in much of the world today

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
and in much of the non-traditional

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,560
medical establishment in the united

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,040
states and and the western world

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,240
this is all looked at as one problem one

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
disease

47
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,920
is and it's looked at as an imbalance

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,319
some sort of imbalance

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,359
in the body but with the western medical

50
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,959
model

51
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,640
you have doctors that look at the heart

52
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,239
another doctor looks the kidney another

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
doctor looks at the ear

54
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,599
and it's sort of gotten balkanized like

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,600
this and so you'll have a patient that

56
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,559
will go in and will say that they have

57
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,478
irritable

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,478
bowel problems and then get a diagnosis

59
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,159
by a gi specialist

60
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,159
then goes to a psychiatrist gets a

61
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,000
diagnosis of depression goes to a

62
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,400
neurologist for migraine goes to a

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,199
rheumatologist for complex regional pain

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
syndrome

65
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,878
goes to a dentist for tmj and i can go

66
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,919
on and on and on

67
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,840
and many patients will have more than

68
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,519
one functional disease in fact in a

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,239
study that i helped run with some

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
students

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,039
we found that it was like 10 or so was

72
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,199
like among the average

73
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,039
about people that often go to medical

74
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,639
care and these are just some of them if

75
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,959
your favorite disease is not on there

76
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,000
this is just an idea to show you that

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,360
these are just descriptions

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
of what's wrong with the patient they're

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,959
not really diagnoses but they are

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,560
extremely common some of them like

81
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,560
irritable bowel and migraine

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,400
or 15 to 20 percent of the population

83
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,479
but they're not different parts of the

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,480
population i mean

85
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,318
this doesn't translate to every audience

86
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,158
but there's the metaphor actually comes

87
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,318
from india originally about the

88
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,919
um the elephant and there's three blind

89
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,919
men's that are filling the elephant

90
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,759
one fills the trunk one fills the tail

91
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,280
and one fills the body and they describe

92
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,759
three different animals

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,360
um well there's a you can have blind

94
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,878
doctors up there filling all different

95
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
parts of the elephant and giving many

96
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,359
different diagnoses

97
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,158
and it's really the same patients that

98
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
have

99
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,519
many of these problems but it's not only

100
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,518
that it's the same families is that

101
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,280
over and over again i saw the child

102
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,239
comes in with cyclic vomiting syndrome

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,878
that's what sort of i

104
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,560
ended up specializing in and will have

105
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,280
migraine headache but the mother will

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,799
have

107
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
complex regional pain syndrome and

108
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
depression and the ant will have

109
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
irritable bowel

110
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,000
and then there'll be fibromyalgia in the

111
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,519
grandmother and it goes on and on

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
and you start asking for these

113
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,519
conditions you find that they're in the

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
family

115
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
well the first case that i want to tell

116
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,878
you about this is one of the first three

117
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,560
children that i had that has what i call

118
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,280
now trap one disease

119
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,080
um peyton who's now 14 years old

120
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,560
presented

121
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,719
um a few years ago when she was 11. she

122
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
had cyclic vomiting syndrome for

123
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,598
those of you that don't know what that

124
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,239
is it's actually quite common it's

125
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:18,319
usually misdiagnosed as migraine or

126
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,079
or stomach flu or psychiatric disease or

127
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,439
what have you i've had you know people

128
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,478
be put in prison because they thought

129
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,839
that they were doing it to their

130
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,758
children

131
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,839
they have episodes of nausea and

132
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,319
vomiting and they're lethargic they're

133
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,079
very tired and the episodes can last 12

134
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,918
hours so they can last 12 days the

135
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,159
average is about three days

136
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,599
and they can happen every week it can

137
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,600
happen every month it can happen a

138
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
couple times a year the average is every

139
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,759
month

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,439
but it's different so the average

141
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,319
patient would be vomiting three

142
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,040
four five days um and just be totally

143
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,360
miserable on ivs often in a hospital

144
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
and then go another 25 days completely

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,160
normal and then have another episode

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,478
it's totally disabling um they can't

147
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
do school very well i mean if you can't

148
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,758
hold a job like that

149
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,918
so she had that the first 10 years of

150
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,680
her life and then she developed chronic

151
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,639
migraine and that she had migraine

152
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,120
headache that was

153
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,720
24 7 365. she also had chronic pain

154
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,720
throughout her entire body but that was

155
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
not her major issue her major issue was

156
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,160
the chronic fatigue

157
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,000
her chronic fatigue syndrome was so bad

158
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,759
that it was difficult for her to join

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,319
the table for breakfast and if she did

160
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,800
that

161
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,879
she was completely exhausted and had to

162
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
go to bed the rest of the day

163
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,719
she was a brilliant student got straight

164
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,079
a's but was doing it from a home

165
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,720
computer and can only

166
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,959
concentrate a couple hours a day she

167
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
also had multiple hospitalization for

168
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,359
bowel clean outs because her

169
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,439
your intestines would not work every

170
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,560
once in a while

171
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:49,759
now based upon the technology that that

172
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,360
we developed at cortigen we found that

173
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,120
first of all of course we look for known

174
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,319
mutations and we look for obvious

175
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,000
mutations in

176
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,560
about 1200 genes that involve the

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,439
mitochondria and i'll get to that later

178
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,600
but we also are looking at polymorphisms

179
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,519
or variants in the genes the

180
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,520
ideas is that some people do have

181
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,439
monogenic disease they have an obvious

182
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,240
mutation in a gene and that causes the

183
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,240
disease

184
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,560
but most of the most people that have

185
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,038
fatigue and fame and things like that

186
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,319
it's polygenic and multifactorial i mean

187
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,519
it's the whole thing is that there's

188
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,280
many genes and there's many

189
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,079
environmental components

190
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,599
and much longer than i've been in the

191
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,439
field people have been talking about

192
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,439
that but until recently it was just oh

193
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,439
it involves many genes and it would stop

194
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,279
there well now we can actually sequence

195
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,360
all the genes

196
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,399
one thing that i noticed on peyton is

197
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,439
that she had

198
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,918
a change in a gene on trap one

199
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,478
it's it's not a rare change it's in one

200
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,959
percent of the european population

201
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,318
and but i had a few other patients that

202
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,918
had exactly that same

203
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,680
change that had exactly the same

204
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,799
symptoms and it was putting the two

205
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,519
together

206
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
this is a change as um here is that from

207
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,279
isoleucine this is p

208
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,120
is for protein from isoleucine to valine

209
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,359
at position 253.

210
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,199
again it's a common polymorphism one

211
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,038
percent of the european population has

212
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
it about one half of one percent of the

213
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,279
world population has

214
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,879
it um but it described a lot of the

215
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,198
problems here

216
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,959
and i'll get to this is involved in

217
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,280
antioxidant defenses

218
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,519
and then when she was put on antioxidant

219
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,598
very high doses of many antioxidants she

220
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,000
got a lot better she went to school

221
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,598
was there for maybe two hours a day big

222
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,279
difference from before her pain had

223
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,560
pretty much gone away and she no longer

224
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,918
need bowels

225
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,360
on bowel cleanups so

226
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,758
what trap one is is it is a homodymer

227
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,800
this is two copies of the same

228
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,160
peptide that are scrunched together and

229
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
it is a chaperone

230
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,000
um you know what chaperones are in the

231
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
classical senses that they take things

232
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,639
where they're supposed to go

233
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,840
and they're not supposed to do things

234
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
they're not supposed to do on the way

235
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,839
there

236
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,279
all right okay so a molecular chaperone

237
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,959
takes the proteins

238
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,559
the polypeptides that are made on the

239
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,680
ribosome and it takes them where they're

240
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,839
supposed to go and they're not supposed

241
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,800
to fold incorrectly on the way there

242
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,000
and then they get to where they're

243
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,120
supposed to go and then they have to do

244
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,038
what they need to do

245
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,519
so that's what a molecular chaperone is

246
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,360
and trap one is the main chaperone

247
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,598
in the mitochondria there's a lot of

248
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
chaperones in the cytoplasm other organs

249
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,360
that

250
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,198
other things like endoplasmic reticulum

251
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,800
have chaperones but this is the main

252
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,759
mitochondrial chaperone

253
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,680
it's 701 amino acids between amino acid

254
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,000
108 and 260

255
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,959
it um actually binds atp it binds atp

256
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,759
to the molecule is like is like a crab

257
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,158
thing and it

258
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,240
goes like that when atp is is um

259
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,319
hydrolyzed uses the energy of atp

260
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,158
to smash the proteins together fold them

261
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,919
into the correct position

262
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,480
we've have since found about a hundred

263
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,079
different cases of trap one and they

264
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,480
pretty much all have the same things

265
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,320
chronic pain fatigue and gi dysmotility

266
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
there's also a lot of other functional

267
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
problems that we have here but these are

268
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
the main three and those are the ones we

269
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,720
have statistical viability for

270
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,799
um and then um they all get much better

271
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,560
in antioxidant proteins

272
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,079
so here shows some of the data that has

273
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,719
been published

274
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
last year we have a lot more data since

275
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,278
then

276
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,519
if you look at chronic pain chronic

277
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,039
fatigue and gi dismotility

278
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,759
this means that you have all three of

279
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,319
them together and you can see that you

280
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,319
know there's

281
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,160
all these percentages and p-values it's

282
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,200
a really busy slide but the one thing i

283
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,360
want to show you

284
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,720
here this is the mutation that peyton

285
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,879
has

286
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,639
it is statistically associated with all

287
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,519
of these symptoms

288
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,759
if you have this mutation you are 5.7

289
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,759
times more likely to have chronic pain

290
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,120
than if you don't have the mutation and

291
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,720
the ones that don't have the mutation

292
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,039
were ones that were sent to coordinate

293
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,120
for

294
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,079
for for testing not just the regular

295
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,679
population

296
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,160
so a highly affected population and your

297
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,639
7.5 times

298
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,079
more likely to have pain fatigue and gi

299
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,838
problems

300
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,440
there are two other mutations that are

301
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,120
on this molecule that also costs the

302
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,959
same thing but it's even worse

303
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,959
i call these the salt bridge mutation

304
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,639
one's positive charge and one's negative

305
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,000
charge and it causes a strap that holds

306
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,600
the atp in

307
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,919
all three of these positions actually

308
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,839
physically touch the atp molecule

309
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,759
you see the odds ratios are even higher

310
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,240
you're 18 times more likely

311
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,519
to have pain fatigue and gi problems if

312
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,159
you have one of the two salt bridge

313
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,639
mutations

314
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,439
and the p value is is just not by chance

315
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,039
alone

316
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
and again the control group here was

317
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,000
other patients that were sent to

318
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,958
coordination because of illness

319
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,200
so if we did it versus a regular

320
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,799
population the p values get much better

321
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,959
so this shows you what the trap one

322
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,278
molecule looks like here's one

323
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,719
of the molecules of trap one one of the

324
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,480
proteins and here's the other one so

325
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
they're exactly identical

326
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,959
the green here is the atp and these are

327
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,920
the three different mutations they all

328
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,958
touch the atp molecule in a crystal

329
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,719
structure

330
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,799
so the question is is you know can we

331
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,079
design antioxidants make a big

332
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,879
difference

333
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,399
i've treated probably myself about 20 25

334
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,000
patients to trap one and they all get a

335
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,679
lot better on antioxidants but it

336
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
doesn't cure them completely

337
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,439
so the question is is can we use the

338
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
information on this molecule and design

339
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
a treatment that goes directly to the

340
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,360
binding site and

341
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,720
and corrects the problem so using um

342
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,720
collaborators at georgia tech

343
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
what they did is they used the crystal

344
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,480
structure of the trap one molecule that

345
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
had been done by x-ray christiography

346
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,959
and

347
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,719
published the human trap one and then

348
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,639
they put it into the computer system at

349
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
georgia tech and then put all of these

350
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,759
different variants

351
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,439
in it to show the tiny little

352
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,799
differences in the molecule and when you

353
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
take a look at it there's

354
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,958
very tiny little differences to the

355
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,399
binding site that these mutations make

356
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,719
but not much at all

357
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,679
so then they said they ran the entire

358
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,759
computer system

359
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,679
over the weekend of georgia tech and

360
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,679
took every molecule known to man

361
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,759
and threw it into this binding site with

362
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,919
the idea of finding a molecule

363
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,919
which binds to the mutant very tightly

364
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,799
but doesn't bind to the wild type almost

365
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,479
at all

366
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,479
and one of the things that we came up

367
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
with was

368
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,480
something that a lot of you might have

369
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,838
heard of is chitral kaitril is a drug

370
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,240
that's out there that's used for

371
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,079
chemotherapy induced vomiting

372
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,720
it is has i've used it several times

373
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,159
before this came up i'm in patients that

374
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,320
zofran wouldn't work for

375
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,759
for nausea and vomiting it has almost no

376
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,959
side effects unfortunately drug

377
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,799
companies don't like to pay for it

378
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,039
because it's incredibly expensive which

379
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,879
has become an issue

380
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,879
when he gave caitrol to peyton

381
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,399
her disease just melted away completely

382
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,440
i mean she is now

383
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,360
full time in school has no pain

384
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,440
essentially at all and has no chronic

385
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,000
fatigue no gi problem she's basically

386
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,600
completely

387
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,958
well on that drug and that's the

388
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,320
putting all of these different things

389
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:50,000
together was able to get us

390
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,760
the second patient here is thomas

391
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,519
that's this one here this is the pro

392
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,078
band the one that first

393
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,560
brought to genetics that's her his

394
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,799
sister

395
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,239
i'm kira kyra has cyclic vomiting

396
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,759
syndrome migraine muscle weakness

397
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,360
depression and a lot of different things

398
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,240
she's been in and out of hospitals all

399
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,320
her life

400
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,440
thomas is her younger brother who's now

401
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,079
in college

402
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,760
um he had complex regional pain syndrome

403
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,199
migraine depression a couple other

404
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,519
things

405
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,879
this pedigree shows maternal inheritance

406
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,440
in fact before

407
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,399
we figured out that there was trap one

408
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,399
in this family

409
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,440
i used to use this exact slide in

410
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,919
medical school

411
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,160
to show what maternal inheritance is the

412
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,199
mitochondrial dna comes from the egg not

413
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,120
from the sperm

414
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,560
that your sequence is exactly the same

415
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,519
as that of your mother and all of your

416
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,838
siblings

417
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,679
everyone that has a black symbol here by

418
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,600
virtue of the relationship has

419
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,120
exactly the same mitochondrial dna

420
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,879
sequence as the proband

421
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,480
every one of the white symbol has a

422
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,000
different sequence we've actually

423
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,440
sequenced everyone in the family so we

424
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,078
know that for sure but that's just it

425
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
has to be

426
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,838
that way and you can see the people that

427
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,480
have black symbols are more likely to

428
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,639
have

429
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,159
common functional disease than the

430
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,519
people with white symbols and you know

431
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,198
there's some functional disease out

432
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,360
there and then some people here are

433
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,639
you know well some people over here are

434
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,519
kind of normal

435
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,519
but um my point is is that it's a risk

436
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,360
factor

437
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,120
no but everyone in the family has

438
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,519
completely different disease so for

439
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,320
decades we were saying well there is a

440
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,278
nuclear modifier there's a gene on the

441
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,120
chromosomes

442
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,879
that comes from one or the other parent

443
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,198
that modifies this so it's not just the

444
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,720
mitochondrial dna mutation which is by

445
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,159
the way it's it's a

446
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,839
it's a slip mutation where there's a

447
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,600
whole bunch of cytosines and that just

448
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,120
keeps slipping through

449
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,879
the polymerase and so you get a whole

450
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,240
bunch of them instead of a few in this

451
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,120
in this family

452
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,039
um but there's more to it than that and

453
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,959
we found out that the issue with thomas

454
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,639
is actually that he has a trap one

455
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,559
mutation so this is tr

456
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,000
this is i've already told you a bit

457
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,000
about him his major problem is pots

458
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,159
which is you get syncope or fainting

459
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,159
when you stand up or just randomly

460
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,000
he would be in class sitting in classes

461
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,360
and just suddenly he would just fall

462
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
down

463
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,639
and go into seizure-like moments and

464
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,919
they'd bring the paramedics and send

465
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,278
them to the hospital and it really

466
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,278
wasn't good for him being a high school

467
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,958
student going through that

468
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,480
it got to the point that paramedics were

469
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,759
coming about once a month to the school

470
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,639
the school kicked them out because they

471
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,000
didn't want to take the

472
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,680
liability and so his life was pretty

473
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,039
much ruined as far as he was concerned

474
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,319
plus he had some chronic fatigue

475
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,039
syndrome

476
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
he was also on antioxidants had gotten a

477
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,599
lot better

478
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,278
he has the um a point mutation here

479
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,159
which is actually this means a stop

480
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,639
mutation

481
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,719
the protein is disrupted at the point

482
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,320
that it that it binds with atp so

483
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,519
exactly how that's working we're not

484
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,680
really sure

485
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,839
his by the way his pots got better on on

486
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,838
high-dose arginine

487
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,159
the third patient is um and this one has

488
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,919
the chronic this one has the um the

489
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,439
classic trap one mutation

490
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,599
this is a little boy with autism and he

491
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,959
one of the things that i noticed is that

492
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,600
in my first

493
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,439
20 or so trap one patients that i had

494
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,278
over half the boys that had the trap one

495
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,079
mutation had autism

496
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,078
and when we started collecting data from

497
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,319
across the country and abroad

498
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,719
that a large you know as many as a third

499
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,800
to a half of all the boys with trap one

500
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,160
had autism and it was statistically

501
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:17,120
significant for the salt bridge

502
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,639
mutations

503
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,360
so we said you know well maybe that this

504
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,000
is a risk factor for autism as well

505
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,120
so i collected this boy came to me with

506
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,759
autism

507
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
and he presented the first year of life

508
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,320
after

509
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,399
um the mmr vaccination he developed

510
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,079
autistic regression he was normal prior

511
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,559
to that

512
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,319
and then he had laboratory disease

513
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,679
laboratory testing suggested a

514
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,920
mitochondrial disease

515
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,559
we found the common trap one variant in

516
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,719
him um and then the question is is okay

517
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,719
you know what will the caitrill do to

518
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,879
this kid who's just autistic

519
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,240
put him on caitrell after you know

520
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,919
informed consent

521
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,519
and this is what the the parents had

522
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,120
mentioned about that that

523
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,039
on kai troll there was a dramatic

524
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
improvement he became more talkative

525
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,639
expressed himself better didn't fight

526
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,199
with his siblings anymore

527
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,640
was more focused um the main difference

528
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,079
is is that they would never even they

529
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,759
said they would never even think about

530
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,159
going out to dinner with before he would

531
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,000
just

532
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,519
i mean he they couldn't even have a

533
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,359
dinner at home with him he would just go

534
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,439
crazy and throw things from the table

535
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,359
but now they can go to a restaurant and

536
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,038
he will sit quietly and eat

537
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,678
and that it's an amazing difference and

538
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,879
he's not sedated or anything

539
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,960
of course you could say well this you

540
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,320
know could be a placebo effect or

541
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,200
something like that but then the

542
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,960
pharmacy ran

543
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,720
out of the drug and the insurance

544
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,679
company started balking and then he

545
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,600
regressed again

546
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,360
when he went off of it he went back on

547
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,119
the drug and he's gotten better again

548
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,038
and the preschool teacher has never been

549
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,558
informed of these changes and had said

550
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,240
the same thing the parents did

551
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,639
that they are associated with chitral

552
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,640
therapy

553
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,480
this comes off the united mitochondrial

554
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,400
disease foundation website

555
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,079
basically almost anything can be from

556
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,759
mitochondrial disease is the way a lot

557
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,519
of people take this

558
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,519
there's two things about this first of

559
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,639
all it is mostly neuromuscular

560
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,639
abnormalities

561
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,679
because the nerves and muscle require a

562
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,280
lot of energy

563
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,280
the second thing is is that

564
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,279
energy is required for all cells and so

565
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,000
if you do have mitochondrial disease you

566
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,000
can have problems in a lot of the body

567
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,599
this is um i've been told that you guys

568
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
are going to get the slides

569
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,279
this is what i've put together for

570
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,798
physicians to say okay mitochondrial

571
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,279
disease can cause a lot of things but

572
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,639
when do you most likely consider it

573
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,240
certainly not everyone with these

574
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
problems has mitochondrial disease that

575
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,480
would be ridiculous

576
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,840
and certainly there's a lot of people

577
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,360
with mitochondrial disease that have

578
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,359
things off of this slide

579
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,119
but if you have two or more and

580
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,319
particularly if you have three or more

581
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,479
of these things the chance of

582
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:48,079
mitochondrial disease is pretty high

583
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,079
these are what i call the red flags

584
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,798
just very very basic 20-second biology

585
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,038
the mitochondria is made from the

586
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,440
mitochondrial dna which is basically a

587
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,119
bacterial genome which was

588
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,279
combined with an archaea genome two

589
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,159
billion years ago to make all our

590
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,240
all on eukaryotic life all complex life

591
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,000
comes from that original interaction all

592
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,000
complex life are symbiotes of two

593
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,919
different organisms the mitochondrial

594
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,359
dna has a completely different genetic

595
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,840
structure it has a different genetic

596
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,240
code

597
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,359
it comes from your mother only but of

598
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,599
the

599
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,519
most of the proteins in the nucleus most

600
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,519
of the proteins in the mitochondria

601
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,798
are made from the nuclear encoded

602
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,359
proteins there are 1013 proteins by one

603
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:33,279
count

604
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,279
that are made in the nucleus that go to

605
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,038
the mitochondria so you can have

606
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,960
maternal inheritance for mitochondrial

607
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,119
dna or you can have the usual

608
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,160
inheritance models from nuclear dna

609
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,678
abnormalities

610
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,759
they can both cause mitochondrial

611
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,280
disease as you've seen in my patients

612
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,440
i've shown you so far

613
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,639
all the ones i've shown you so far have

614
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,558
have

615
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,759
mutations in both of those which makes

616
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,960
them biogenomic

617
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,319
and much more complicated and then this

618
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,558
is just to show you the metabolic

619
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,759
pathways are very involved but it's much

620
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,000
more than that

621
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,440
all of these and many many more types of

622
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,279
proteins are necessary

623
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,679
for every enzyme there's something that

624
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,960
has to transcribe it to translate it

625
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,320
to to glycosylate it to chaperone it to

626
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,400
you know all the different things that

627
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,319
are necessary to um

628
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,720
for each metabolic enzyme and

629
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,639
so that what cortigen has is it has two

630
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,558
test products one for the mitochondrial

631
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,520
dna

632
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,399
one for the nuclear dna that look at all

633
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,679
1200

634
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,919
proteins in great detail looking for

635
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,240
genotype phenotype correlations to be

636
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:49,200
able to make this sort of thing happen

637
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:49,200
and that's it
