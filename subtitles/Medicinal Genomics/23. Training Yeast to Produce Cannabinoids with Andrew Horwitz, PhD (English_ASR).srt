program at dimetrix where he helped

47
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,399
develop the process for using

48
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,679
genetically modified yeast cells

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,759
to produce cannabinoids we discuss

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,079
the advantages of using yeast cells to

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,560
produce cannabinoids instead of cannabis

52
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,199
and hemp

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,359
plants how adjusting the precursor

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,840
molecules that are fed to the yeast

55
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:09,199
cells can produce rare and novel

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,598
cannabinoids how cannabis medicine

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,359
researchers can use this technology

58
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,878
to better understand the entourage

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,959
effect why

60
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,359
understanding the way cannabis plants

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,159
produce cannabinoids was essential

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,280
to developing this technology and how

63
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,359
this technology

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
is received by the cannabis community

65
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,359
before we get to my conversation with

66
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,159

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,680
good morning andrew thanks for joining

100
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,039
us thanks ben good to be here

101
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,120
i'm really excited to talk to you with

102
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,840
you today because the topic we're going

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,560
to discuss

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,080
which is synthetic biology and i guess

105
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,560
more specifically

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,760
using genetically engineered yeast to

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,719
create cannabinoids

108
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,000
is just a fascinating topic and i know

109
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,879
you've presented a camid

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,399
2019 on that topic and i've included a

111
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,918
link to that video

112
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,439
in the show notes for people to take a

113
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,839
look at um

114
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,839
and it got a great great response so i'm

115
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,879
really excited to dig into more detail

116
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,719
around that but

117
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,079
for those who aren't familiar with this

118
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,960
process or maybe haven't watched the

119
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,399
video yet

120
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,560
i was hoping we could start and you

121
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,959
could um

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,079
use you could perform a little explain

123
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,959
like i'm five

124
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,879
the the process of using yeast to create

125
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,159
cannabinoids

126
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,279
yeah sure so um the the basic idea here

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
is that you

128
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,719
obviously cannabinoids are made in the

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,560
cannabis plant normally

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,120
and that occurs through a series of

131
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,199
chemical reactions that the plant

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,639
is essentially conducting inside the

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,919
inside the plant cells and then in the

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,960
trichomes

135
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:07,038
and so those those reactions each each

136
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,959
step in that kind of assembly line to

137
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,680
build the final molecules

138
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,399
is uh controlled by a protein or an

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,519
enzyme

140
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,758
that basically manipulates the precursor

141
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,399
chemicals into the final chemical

142
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,319
each of those enzymes is uh you know the

143
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,879
blueprint for that assembly line

144
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,560
it's encoded by genes in the plant and

145
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,759
so so basically the whole idea of

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,360
biotech in general

147
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,160
and you know specifically for using

148
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,960
yeast to create cannabinoids is that

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,000
what we do is we identify those genes in

150
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,399
the plant which is

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,680
actually quite a difficult task but we

152
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,000
identify the genes

153
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,959
um when you get them all together you

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,199
say you've identified the full pathway

155
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,638
and then we put those genes into a yeast

156
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,759
cell and you say well why would you use

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,079
yeast

158
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,479
well it's because yeast are are quite

159
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,079
easy to manipulate genetically

160
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,439
and there's just a ton of knowledge on

161
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,519
how to grow them to really high

162
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,639
densities and gigantic fermentation

163
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,918
tanks

164
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,079
and then they can just spit out those

165
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,399
cannabinoids that you've you've put in

166
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,599
by

167
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,359
that genetic pathway

168
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,879
so you're essentially identifying the

169
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
genes in the plant

170
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,360
and then

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
you're identifying the genes that are in

172
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,519
the plant that are creating these

173
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,360
compounds

174
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,639
and then genetically engineering them

175
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,879
into yeast how are

176
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,720
how is that accomplished is that crispr

177
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,399
or some other technique

178
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
yeah so there's all sorts of ways to put

179
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,159
genes into yeast and i think crispr is

180
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,758
um you know the most recent uh trick for

181
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,759
getting getting foreign dna

182
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,439
into a into a microbe and crispr is

183
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,360
really powerful but there are

184
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,839
there are a number of ways one could do

185
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,600
it um but in the end essentially you're

186
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,038
you're getting the yeast cell to take up

187
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,240
a piece of foreign dna and

188
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,240
and um splice it into its own genome

189
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,519
that's fascinating and i know that in

190
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,359
the

191
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,879
in the canmed video you sort of

192
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,038
explained first

193
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,800
how the plant creates these cannabinoids

194
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,240
and one of the things that was really

195
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
interesting was that the conversion of

196
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,120
cbg to thc

197
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,519
and cbda actually occurs outside of the

198
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,439
cell

199
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,959
in the trichome which was really

200
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,319
interesting um

201
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,159
but i don't want to steal your thunder i

202
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,800
was hoping that you could

203
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
maybe explain briefly how the plant

204
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,639
creates

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
the cannabinoids yeah that's a that's a

206
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,918
great question because actually the way

207
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,879
that the plant does this chemistry and

208
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,839
this is some really interesting

209
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,120
chemistry that

210
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,399
and i'm not a chemist by the way i'm

211
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,560
going to talk about the biology but the

212
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,638
way that the plant does this chemistry

213
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
is both fascinating and creates a

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,240
difficult sec uh situation for the

215
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,280
genetic engineer who's trying to do this

216
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,598
in yeast

217
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,719
and so that's because um so in the plant

218
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,959
cell

219
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,360
um let me see how far to zoom back here

220
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,159
so when you're making cannabinoids

221
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,520
you you basically take two precursor

222
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,919
molecules

223
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,680
uh a livitolic acid and a molecule

224
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,959
called gpp

225
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,959
and fuse them together to make cbga and

226
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,318
and cbga so the a by the way when i'm

227
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,918
talking about cannabinoids

228
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,720
uh cbda thca you're hearing that a there

229
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,680
that's because the

230
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,240
the natural form of the plant is an acid

231
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,959
um

232
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,759
when when that natural form is heated up

233
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,439
uh the acid pops off it's decarboxylated

234
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,240
i think probably many listeners would be

235
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,680
familiar with that

236
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,800
at that point you get the more familiar

237
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,400
thc or cbd so it's the same for cbga

238
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,560
cbg is cbga

239
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,239
without the acid on it so just a quick

240
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,560
quick explanation there why i'm saying a

241
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
all the time so so cbga is the mother

242
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,918
cannabinoid and that

243
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,599
that's that molecule is produced in the

244
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,838
cell but then what's really interesting

245
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,800
is the final conversion of cbga into

246
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
these better known

247
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,000
cannabinoids like thca or cbda that

248
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,799
occurs

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,799
outside of the cell in this specialized

250
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,319
compartment called the trichome

251
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,838
and i think again most people have seen

252
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,399
pictures these are beautiful

253
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,720
uh structures in the plant it's when you

254
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,519
when you look at a a um

255
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,360
a bud uh cannabis bud you'll see the

256
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,200
crystalline kind of appearance on it

257
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,680
those are those are trichomes and so

258
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,839
trichomes are essentially um you know

259
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,039
chemical reaction chambers

260
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,519
where cvga can be converted

261
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,559
by enzymes called synthases cannabinoid

262
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,440
synthases

263
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,759
into thca that would be by the action of

264
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,600
the

265
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,399
the thca synthase or cbda by the cbda

266
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,480
synthase

267
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,080
those are the two major synthases it's

268
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
possible that those other synthases out

269
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,759
there like the cbca synthase

270
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,200
but those are the major ones and this

271
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,080
reaction is occurring outside of the

272
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,959
cell which is

273
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,560
which is somewhat unusual um and that's

274
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,639
what pose is really a

275
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,319
big challenge for the yeast engineer

276
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,559
who's trying to make cannabinoids inside

277
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,879
a yeast cell because as you can imagine

278
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,679
the situation in a trichome outside of

279
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,200
the cell different ph oily

280
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,799
is very different than the situation

281
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
inside a yeast cell so getting those

282
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,479
enzymes that are used to working in the

283
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
trichome to work in the yeast cell

284
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
i think represents one of the biggest

285
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,079
challenges for making cannabinoids by

286
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,679
biotech

287
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,440
so that's interesting so are there two

288
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,479
separate processes here first it's

289
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,600
creating that mother cannabinoid cbga

290
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,159
and then is there sort of a second

291
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,159
strain of yeast that's sort of doing the

292
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,759
synthase process

293
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,199
so i think that probably most people

294
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,600
would try to do it in the same strain

295
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,000
but

296
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,759
but you have a great point there which

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,320
is these are it's kind of like two very

298
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,078
different skill sets making cvga

299
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
which happens inside the yeast cell and

300
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,719
draws on these two precursor molecules

301
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,360
the lipitolic acid and gpp

302
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,879
that's one that's one challenge and then

303
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,039
it's almost an entirely separate

304
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,600
challenge to then convert that cbga so

305
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,759
it's

306
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,480
it's i know that folks have contemplated

307
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,559
doing these

308
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,159
these things in separate steps uh

309
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,518
certainly and um

310
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,360
because you're really looking for you

311
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,560
kind of need a an athlete that's

312
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,839
uh you know accomplished in two entirely

313
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,799
different events

314
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,800
so um i think that's a that's insightful

315
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,278
way to say it but i think ideally for a

316
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,838
for a fine economically feasible process

317
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,240
you would be

318
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,079
getting it all done in one one strain

319
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,000
would do the full conversion of

320
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:12,159
production of cbga and conversion into

321
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,799
the final thca or cbda product

322
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,319
so that's ideal but is that what is that

323
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,240
the reality right now or is that the

324
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
goal

325
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,519
so i think what you're seeing right now

326
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,039
is a lot of the um

327
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,799
a lot of the press releases i've seen

328
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,639
coming out from companies in the in the

329
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,439
you know biotech cannabinoids field have

330
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,278
been about cbga and about cbg

331
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,440
and cbg is a really interesting molecule

332
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,399
i think with a lot of of uh terrific

333
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,399
properties

334
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
i mean something i would say is that the

335
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,519
difficulty genetic engineering

336
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
difficulty does not necessarily

337
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,720
correlate with

338
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,039
the value of the molecule on a

339
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,680
biological basis so what i mean is that

340
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:50,159
it's you know it's more straightforward

341
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,359
to make cbga than it is to make thca or

342
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,600
cbda certainly

343
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,959
but cbga is a great target for biotech

344
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
as well and so

345
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,399
um i think that there's been you know

346
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,278
increasing awareness

347
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,720
of how cbga and the decarboxylated form

348
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:03,838
cvg

349
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,079
have a number of very interesting

350
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,800
effects that you know overlap in part

351
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:08,838
with uh

352
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,399
you know some of the profile of cbd for

353
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,279
example

354
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,559
so so i guess um i'm sure if i'm

355
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,600
answering your question exactly there

356
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,838
but i think i think that

357
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,720
cbga is a great first target for the

358
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,480
field

359
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,200
and i think that pulling that all the

360
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,639
way through to cbda and thca

361
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,278
is absolutely going to happen it's a

362
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,278
little more work

363
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,519
okay so if i'm understanding what you're

364
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,959
saying

365
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,759
are you saying that we're not there yet

366
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,078
are we able to create thca in cbda

367
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,360
through this process oh absolutely

368
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:40,638
absolutely and i think that's something

369
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,959
that's important to stress

370
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,519
is that um when you're doing strain

371
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:48,078
engineering to make biotech molecules

372
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,200
um there's there's a number of phases

373
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:50,799
there's the phase where you don't even

374
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,440
know what all the genes in the pathway

375
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,958
are

376
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,200
and that was kind of the situation i'll

377
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:58,078
say for example it

378
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,920
if you go back to the early days of

379
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,399
demetrics

380
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,399
demetrix was founded based on technology

381
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,600
coming out of jake's link lab

382
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,278
and jay had uh and his his team had

383
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,959
discovered a missing enzyme

384
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,559
in the pathway and so that's those are

385
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,559
the initial things right like we you

386
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,399
just have the the minimum number of

387
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,559
enzymes to make the product and then

388
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,559
you can detect the product right like

389
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,838
tiny vanishingly small amounts

390
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,039
and then you're making more and more of

391
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,399
the product and at some point you're

392
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,919
making so much of the product and you've

393
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,519
scaled it up that it's economically

394
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,159
feasible and you can go to market with

395
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,959
it

396
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,600
and so my point there about cbg was just

397
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,638
that

398
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,800
cbg because it is um you know

399
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,320
a step on the pathway towards cbd and

400
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,198
thc and the other

401
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
calling terminal cannabinoids there um

402
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:43,198
is

403
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,720
is something that i think the biotech

404
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,519
companies are able to hit first

405
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
because uh it's you know it's a partial

406
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,078
pathway

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,839
essentially so but definitely uh you

408
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:55,519
know a number of groups have shown

409
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,800
that thca and cbda can be made

410
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,519
okay and yeah i mean cbg is definitely

411
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,559
a a cannabinoid that's i on a lot of

412
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,078
people's radars

413
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,119
i i know especially on the cultivation

414
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,439
side trying to

415
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,120
create plants that are cbg rich

416
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,880
and of course that comes with its own

417
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
challenges of trying to find knockouts

418
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,399
in the synthase genes

419
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,919
so maybe that's a good place to kind of

420
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,159
step back a bit and

421
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,439
i was wondering if you could comment on

422
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,719
how does this approach

423
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,839
of creating cannabinoids how is it

424
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,079
what are the advantages to it over

425
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,199
traditional

426
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:38,319
cultivation yeah so i think that um

427
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,759
where where biotech makes a lot of sense

428
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,360
is when you're talking about rare

429
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,159
natural products

430
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,639
and that is what you know i don't

431
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,360
there's

432
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,480
there's i've said for a while i live in

433
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,199
california that

434
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,680
that getting high is a solved problem um

435
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,078
you know

436
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,278
it's i think a lot of the um in

437
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:56,879
california for sure

438
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,240
i think a lot of the interest here is in

439
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,399
these more we'll call them the minor

440
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,639
cannabinoids things like cbg

441
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,679
um things like cdc you know there's

442
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,360
there's just you know there's

443
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,799
over a hundred of these compounds right

444
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
and we know so little about most of them

445
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,359
so i think where biotech really shines

446
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,399
and where

447
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,519
um i think that it it really add

448
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,759
something

449
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,839
is is going after those more minor ones

450
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,278
um and there's been some amazing feats

451
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,680
of plant breeding

452
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,958
you know i i am not in that area at all

453
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,198
it's a different type of genetics i

454
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,278
don't know much about to be honest but

455
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,719
you know attending canmed in 2019 and

456
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,559
listening to some of these talks

457
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,399
it's clear that plant breeders are able

458
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,278
to do some pretty amazing things get to

459
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,198
get to

460
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,639
to plants that make some pretty rare

461
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:37,838
compounds and

462
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,320
you know amounts i wouldn't have thought

463
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,800
possible but it's still very hard um you

464
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,800
know you're

465
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,039
you're for example when you look at the

466
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,159
um you look at the barons for

467
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,000
uh example you're you're basically to

468
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,679
get to get high-level variant production

469
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
in a plant you would need to kind of

470
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,519
shift the

471
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,120
uh balance of fatty acid production in

472
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,078
the plant and these things again

473
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,600
anything's possible but it strikes me as

474
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,359
pretty difficult because the plant's

475
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,120
sole purpose is not just to produce

476
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,839
cannabinoids it obviously has to

477
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,198
support roots and leaves and growth and

478
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,480
all sorts of other things

479
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,559
so the advantage of the yeast cell in

480
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,240
biotech is that um

481
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,679
you know we can we can re-engineer the

482
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,039
yeast cell pretty radically it's a

483
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,278
single cell organism

484
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,078
it really just exists to produce more

485
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,519
yeast

486
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,599
and so we can redirect that energy um

487
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,120
and do things like uh you know

488
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,519
re-engineer

489
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,600
uh central metabolism in ways that let

490
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,959
us really focus on specific

491
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,079
rare cannabinoids and um so

492
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,159
you know to the extent that you're

493
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,239
trying to purify some rare cannabinoid

494
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,159
out of a bunch of plant biomass

495
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
away from other very similar but you

496
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,600
know cannabinoids that you don't want

497
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,278
that's that's much less of an issue in

498
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,199
yeast where we can we can essentially

499
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,399
put in a very specific pathway that gets

500
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,000
you from

501
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,799
you know point a to point b which is

502
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,799
your rare uh cannabinoid and and have

503
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,359
that be a single or

504
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,519
you know predominant product uh that's

505
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,680
that's secreted from the yeast cell

506
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,558
and so i think the advantage over over

507
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,798
agriculture

508
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,399
there's all sorts of advantages i mean

509
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,918
predictability

510
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,120
so the the product profile that you're

511
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,799
going to get coming out of the yeast

512
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,879
fermentation which is occurring inside a

513
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:18,400
stainless steel tank is going to be

514
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,039
much more consistent than what you're

515
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,120
going to see

516
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,480
out of a grow operation even an indoor

517
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,719
grow operation in

518
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,480
you know in a in a greenhouse you're

519
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,000
still dealing with you know whole plants

520
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,640
and you have less control over the

521
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,599
over the situation so that's one thing i

522
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,759
think the time

523
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,599
you know it takes about i would say one

524
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,879
to three weeks to do a biotech

525
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,839
fermentation process to make

526
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
cannabinoids

527
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,000
it's going to take um you know three

528
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,079
months to grow plants

529
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,359
um i think at the end you know i talked

530
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,480
a little bit about the purification

531
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,038
trying to purify

532
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,480
compounds out of a you know big plant

533
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,160
mess versus out of whole cell

534
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,599
fermentation broth

535
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,840
you get a cleaner product coming out

536
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,319
with biotech most often

537
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,119
um trying to think if i've hit

538
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,918
everything there

539
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,558
and then i think you know the the um the

540
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,840
other really

541
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,319
really cool thing and i talked about

542
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,279
this a little bit at canmed in 2019 is

543
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,119
that there's this

544
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,119
flexibility and optionality of the

545
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,719
fermentation platform

546
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,159
part of the part of the technology that

547
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,600
jay keisling described in

548
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,440
in his lab's paper on production of

549
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,038
cannabinoids and yeast and that

550
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,240
demetrics carried on was the ability to

551
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,319
feed these uh kind of precursor

552
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,919
molecules the fatty acids into the yeast

553
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,439
cell and have to be incorporated

554
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,038
into the molecule and so that allows you

555
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,960
to build a single strain

556
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,160
and then then produce you know either

557
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
for example cbd

558
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,320
or cbdv you know the varun's with

559
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,120
different different length tails on

560
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,960
these molecules and you can really just

561
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,558
customize that in a modular fashion by

562
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,720
feeding different fatty acids

563
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,480
so i think that in an unorganized way

564
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,600
covers covers some of the advantages of

565
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,279
biotech

566
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,918
just kind of precision purity

567
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,359
speed these are all all things that are

568
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,559
particularly important when you're going

569
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,079
after these very rare cannabinoids

570
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,558
yeah and i think that last point that

571
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:10,240
you were talking about was particularly

572
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:12,798
fascinating the the whole idea of

573
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,279
introducing different precursors to the

574
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,400
yeast

575
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,918
and then kind of being able to not

576
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,000
really mix and match but

577
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,440
like you said to customize different

578
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,038
cannabinoids

579
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,519
i wonder if you could speak a little bit

580
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,519
more to that and is it possible to

581
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,038
essentially create cannabinoids that we

582
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,839
haven't yet seen

583
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,960
naturally occurring in the plant yeah

584
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,319
absolutely and

585
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,400
i think that you know there's an example

586
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,200
of that in jay's paper as well

587
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
if you look at the paper they they um

588
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,440
use

589
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,279
called precursor feeding to get some

590
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,840
uh features on the molecule that don't

591
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,319
exist in nature and would would set that

592
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,918
cannabinoid up for further modification

593
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,279
through things like click chemistry

594
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,640
where you could create libraries

595
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,558
so that's that's what's known as a

596
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,799
semi-synthetic approach but

597
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,440
yeah absolutely you can make new to

598
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:04,639
nature cannabinoids in yeast

599
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,240
by a feeding fatty acid precursors that

600
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,600
don't exist in nature the yeast cell

601
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,279
sees these and just as great

602
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,639
and incorporates them into the pathway

603
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,839
pulls them into the pathway puts them in

604
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,720
the molecule

605
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,359
and so if you feed hexanoic acid which

606
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,319
is the

607
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,079
you know kind of canonical version of

608
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,079
the fatty acid then you get cbd

609
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,359
or thc but if you start feeding other

610
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,678
fatty acids you can

611
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,119
change the chain length and get these

612
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,000
other forms both natural

613
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,000
and unnatural

614
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,240
so i have to imagine researchers on

615
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,440
the the medical side or the healthcare

616
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,679
provider side or

617
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,600
maybe even you know kind of before that

618
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,798
sort of the the basic

619
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:49,038
um kind of drug development

620
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,918
side must be very interested in

621
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,879
exploring

622
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,679
that and being be very interested in

623
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
getting sort of

624
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,960
mass quantities of these rare

625
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,558
cannabinoids

626
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,640
yeah i think that's one of the value

627
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,279
propositions of biotech is the ability

628
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,240
to kind of

629
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,000
provide samples of these rare and new to

630
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,120
nature cannabinoids

631
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,798
for further testing um i mean

632
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,399
it's i think that you know when you

633
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,038
think about there's i guess a couple of

634
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,960
approved

635
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,240
fda approved drugs in the cannabinoid

636
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,679
family basically

637
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,798
you know maybe more than that but

638
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,480
roughly speaking thc and cbd so you got

639
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,639
marinol and epidiolex and then there's

640
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,480
some other variants of thc out there

641
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,679
and the question that i've kind of

642
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,120
struggled with is why

643
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,480
why aren't there more of these compounds

644
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,279
out there i mean they're so they're so

645
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,440
bioactive they're largely non-toxic

646
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,440
um it's a really interesting set of

647
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,640
chemical matter that seems underexplored

648
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,279
and i mean i think part of the reason's

649
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,038
structural

650
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,798
right it's been very difficult to do

651
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,240
research on cannabinoids for a long time

652
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,879
in this country

653
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,159
um but another another piece of it is

654
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,760
access i think it's

655
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,280
um you know if you're an academic

656
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,798
researcher trying to get a hold of these

657
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,720
rare cannabinoids

658
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,879
i mean it's you know they're present in

659
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,480
vanishing these small quantities and so

660
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,320
and the chemical synthesis to get to

661
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,960
these things is very very difficult

662
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,759
so it's very expensive to produce them

663
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,600
so i think that

664
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,279
yeah i think that one of the one of the

665
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,678
really exciting aspects of biotech

666
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,839
production of cannabinoids

667
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,840
the synthetic biology approach is is the

668
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,439
ability to get access

669
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,038
to researchers so we can start to really

670
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,000
better understand what the

671
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:23,359
medical applications for this rich

672
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,359
family of compounds could be

673
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,400
and now i have to ask too um

674
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,319
i have to ask about the entourage effect

675
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,919
um a lot of the

676
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,359
researchers i've spoken to healthcare

677
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,000
professionals you know they're

678
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,439
they're very i wouldn't say it's

679
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,640
unanimous but a

680
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,840
majority favor the sort of whole plant

681
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,720
medicine

682
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,918
with the idea of there being different

683
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,480
cannabinoid

684
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,120
concentrations or even terpenes that are

685
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,679
kind of

686
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,719
contributing to the medicinal effect how

687
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,320
can

688
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,000
this process sort of help them

689
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,480
mimic the entourage effect if they're

690
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
going to be doing some research

691
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,440
yeah i think the entourage effect is

692
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,119
really interesting because it's it's i

693
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,840
think it's been hard to get

694
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,719
you know solid data on it on on it just

695
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,839
because you're

696
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,038
again i mean one of the reasons why uh

697
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,798
most most drugs that approved by the fda

698
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,720
are single molecules is because

699
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,440
it's easy to understand then exactly

700
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,319
what the causal agent is etc and so

701
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,159
i think when you talk about the

702
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,399
entourage effect it gets very

703
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,919
complicated quickly and so i think that

704
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,759
you know something biotech could do

705
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,000
could be produce a palette

706
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,200
of individual compounds that could be

707
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,519
blended

708
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,519
in ways that would allow people to to

709
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,000
test these questions

710
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,000
um you know is the entourage effect and

711
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,599
the same in one strain produced in one

712
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,558
place as it is in another strain in

713
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,879
another place

714
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,558
probably not um you know i saw some

715
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,000
really interesting talks

716
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,079
at the 2019 canmed where um

717
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,519
people were looking at uh very fine

718
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,240
differences between

719
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,400
uh compositions of cannabis and seeing

720
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,200
very different effects and so

721
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,480
um for me it's it's really hard to tell

722
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,240
uh what's going on there

723
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,839
my my personal opinion um is that

724
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:19,440
uh the the cannabis plant did not

725
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,720
evolve to you know get as high

726
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,679
or to you know cure diseases this is you

727
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,960
know it's one of these things the

728
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,559
cannabis plant wants to make more

729
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,278
cannabis plants

730
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,798
and um my guess is that most of the

731
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,359
bioactivity of cannabis

732
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,798
comes from a very smooth few number of

733
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,479
compounds most of which are the

734
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,480
cannabinoids

735
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,919
but you know you absolutely can't rule

736
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,640
out the potential for

737
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,240
for synergistic effects for polypharmacy

738
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,799
so

739
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,359
yeah and i think it's a it's a

740
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:49,519
multi-faceted problem

741
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,959
and it's becoming more and more apparent

742
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,359
the more i talk to

743
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,558
people in different sectors of this

744
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,839
industry

745
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:01,278
um just i mean from a testing side

746
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,119
there's there's challenges in even

747
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,000
identifying these different compounds

748
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,119
in the plant and from the healthcare

749
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,558
side there's

750
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,199
there's challenges in getting a

751
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:14,000
consistent product to really do

752
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,000
solid research on so i think something

753
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,880
like this would would solve

754
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,480
some of those problems at least um to be

755
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,960
able to create something that's

756
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,640
that's more consistent or to be able to

757
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,480
to kind of tinker with

758
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,919
the different the various levels to

759
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,679
really dial in the effect that you're

760
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,360
looking for

761
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,960
yeah absolutely and i mean i think that

762
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,479
there's always going to be

763
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,798
i think there's going to be all sorts of

764
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,798
there's obviously

765
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,720
many many applications for cannabinoids

766
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:41,839
and many types of users of cannabinoids

767
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,278
and i think there's always going to be

768
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,079
people that want to interact directly

769
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,079
with the plant

770
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,278
that you know even going to growing

771
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,879
their own and

772
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,400
and curing and all these things and the

773
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,840
story of where the plant was grown and

774
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,880
how it was grown and

775
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:54,720
and all this and there's going to be

776
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,080
people that are just interested in the

777
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,919
in the single pure compound

778
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,599
and so i think it's you know it's gonna

779
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,919
be a wide range of

780
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:05,119
of users and a wide range of desires for

781
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,120
for what they're interacting with

782
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,319
i think you're absolutely right and i

783
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,879
think sometimes

784
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:13,278
in this industry there are sort of two

785
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,080
competing camps of the single molecule

786
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,159
versus the

787
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,359
the whole plant but i think that there's

788
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,320
room for both

789
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,519
really um but i kind of wanted to ask

790
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,319
you about that

791
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,158
you know kind of being a part of

792
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,678
synthetic biology or kind of creating

793
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,919
cannabinoids through a non-traditional

794
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,038
means has there been any sort of

795
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,880
pushback from

796
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,839
the industry from the more traditional

797
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,760
folks that you've experienced

798
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,119
you know i actually i was um i was a

799
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,158
little concerned about that going to

800
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,439
speak at

801
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,880
canmed you know that there might be some

802
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,640
folks that were angry about the idea of

803
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,000
biotech getting involved and

804
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,278
you know genetically modified and all

805
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,480
this but i found people were largely

806
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,679
people were pretty open-minded they're

807
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,120
largely

808
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,880
you know interested in the science

809
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,000
behind it and the access

810
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,679
i definitely you know had some

811
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,159
conversations where there was concern

812
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,559
about

813
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,799
um i would say two areas one about you

814
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,759
know genetic engineering in general

815
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,119
and i think i'm usually able to convince

816
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,879
people that

817
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,399
all of the you know the natural strains

818
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
we're talking about today are

819
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,440
products of extreme genetic engineering

820
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,880
right the plant

821
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,640
there were there were no plants i mean i

822
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,960
read somewhere that even since the 80s

823
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,640
the the content of thc in top strains

824
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,200
has doubled or tripled or something like

825
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,480
that so

826
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,720
that's all the result of genetic

827
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,240
engineering um you can you can do it by

828
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,079
breeding or you can do it with crispr

829
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,278
but it's it's all genetic engineering in

830
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,599
my mind

831
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,599
um that's that basically creating

832
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,480
organisms with extraordinary

833
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,158
uh capabilities um so that was one piece

834
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,919
the genetically modified piece

835
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,360
and i think that the the the canmet

836
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,120
audience was actually pretty

837
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,639
sophisticated on that one and understood

838
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,879
how it fit into the general

839
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,799
uh artificial selection and breeding

840
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,880
it's one of these many tools to

841
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,240
achieve these extraordinary capabilities

842
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,080
in an organism

843
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,278
but the second piece i think is the one

844
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,558
the idea that that

845
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:03,679
you know big biotech is going to put

846
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:05,519
the is out of business and you know

847
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,759
again i think that that

848
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,440
that's that's pretty unlikely just

849
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,000
because there's always going to be a

850
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,679
market

851
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,038
for for the plant for interacting with

852
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,000
the natural molecule

853
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,359
and at the same time you've got you know

854
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,240
companies that want to start

855
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,599
formulating um these compounds into

856
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,798
their products that are looking for a

857
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,359
really pure

858
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,200
uh dependable steady stream of product

859
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,158
and aren't going to move forward without

860
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,558
one

861
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,240
and so i think that you know what i

862
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,759
would say is that it's a big market

863
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,240
that's only going to get bigger

864
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,599
and so it's not like a zero-sum game or

865
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,278
where you cut a piece of the pie it's

866
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,959
coming from someone else's

867
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:42,319
slice so i think it's it's actually a

868
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,840
case where um

869
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,278
the number of applications is going to

870
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:46,879
increase because of biotech and you're

871
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,558
always going to have growing

872
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,360
so well that's good to hear

873
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,839
um i did want to ask you about terpenes

874
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,240
um

875
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,439
we've talked a lot about cannabinoids um

876
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,079
is there

877
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,679
an application for using biotech to

878
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,558
generate terpenes or are they sort of

879
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,880
more of a

880
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,319
um a common compound that's not really

881
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,679
applicable

882
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,678
so that's a that's a great question it's

883
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,759
funny because my most of my career

884
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,679
in industrial sin bio has been centered

885
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,359
on terpenes and so i

886
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,120
that's cool i started out working at

887
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,158
amorous a company called amorous that's

888
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,719
also in the

889
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,200
the biotech cannabinoids game at this

890
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,079
point

891
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,200
um and i left i left before they got

892
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,079
into that but

893
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,159
amorous was founded around um the

894
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,519
concept of producing terpenes and yeast

895
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,120
and so they've now made

896
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,038
you know at least a dozen different

897
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,278
terpenes and scaled them up to

898
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,879
you know multi-ton scale through

899
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,558
fermentation

900
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,880
and and so um the you know cannabinoid

901
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,398
pathway itself that gpp molecule i was

902
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,880
talking about that gets put together

903
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:51,678
with a livitolic acid to make cbga

904
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,320
gpp is is is the precursor to terpenes

905
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,559
it's it's

906
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,319
uh so and then the cannabinoid molecule

907
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,119
itself is what's known as amero terpene

908
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,200
it's part

909
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,639
part terpene and so then of course

910
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,240
you're talking about the terpenes in the

911
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,200
plant that give the the flavor

912
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,440
and the you know the the sensory

913
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,080
experience of cannabis

914
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,600
um and then and then of course also have

915
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,038
been cited in the entourage effect i

916
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,879
should mention that but

917
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:17,359
but yeah absolutely these are great

918
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,120
targets uh for for biotech

919
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,278
and um in fact i would say that

920
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,519
mastering terpene production

921
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,440
in in yeast was kind of a necessary

922
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,278
precursor to making cannabinoids in

923
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,960
yeast

924
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:33,359
very cool so one of the common

925
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,360
refrains in these conversations that i'm

926
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,678
having with people in the industry

927
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,439
is that there are still things still a

928
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,240
lot of things that we don't know about

929
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,320
cannabis

930
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,558
and i wanted to ask you are there things

931
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:47,599
that we still don't know about how the

932
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:50,480
the plant creates cannabinoids

933
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,798
that would be valuable information for

934
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,759
uh

935
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:57,519
biotech yeah absolutely i think it were

936
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,798
you know the now like i was saying it

937
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,880
was only

938
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,720
you know maybe four four years ago or so

939
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,240
that the the full genetic pathway was

940
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,640
described with the discovery of this

941
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,120
missing enzyme by the kiezling lab

942
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,640
and so it's not like we've known about

943
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,278
this for years you know we've had the

944
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,640
the genome sequence of the plant for

945
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,200
i'm going to probably get this wrong but

946
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,038
i would say about a decade now

947
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,558
and we've had a full pathway for about

948
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,158
four years but i'd say we're at the very

949
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:22,960
beginning of understanding how the plant

950
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,880
works and so

951
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,440
you know while i think we can describe

952
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,080
exactly how to make thca or cbda or the

953
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,278
variance

954
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,720
of those leveren variants of those

955
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,480
you start getting into the more rare

956
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,839
cannabinoids and it's it's

957
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,159
it's not totally clear at least to me um

958
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,359
you know if how those are made by the

959
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,960
plant and so

960
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,558
you know whether they represent chemical

961
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,038
breakdown products of

962
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,918
of molecules that we know how they're

963
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,038
made in the plant

964
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,880
you know that's the case for some of

965
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,720
them or whether there's um you know a

966
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,760
whole slew of different enzymes that are

967
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,720
acting

968
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,558
on um on cbga and other molecules to get

969
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,360
there so yeah absolutely a ton to learn

970
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,319
from the plants still

971
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,240
excellent always happy to hear that so

972
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,119
winding down here i did just want to

973
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,919
give you an

974
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,038
opportunity to let the audience know

975
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,720
where they can learn

976
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,798
more about what we've talked about more

977
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,399
about what you're doing

978
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:22,158
floor is yours yeah absolutely

979
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:25,359
um so i think that you know in terms of

980
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,960
understanding biotech cannabinoids

981
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,558
uh you know the the company i was

982
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,558
formerly with dimitrix

983
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,079
has put out a really excellent series of

984
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,319
blog posts

985
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,398
um kind of uh trying to break down the

986
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,200
science for the for the popular audience

987
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:41,839
and so

988
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,720
i know they've got a a few on cbga uh

989
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,000
cbg the

990
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,440
the you know the science and the

991
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,720
chemistry there and so that's that's a

992
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,159
great one i would check out the divitrix

993
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,759
website and try to learn more about what

994
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,000
they're up to

995
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,158
um so i think that's i think that's a

996
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,720
great starting point on the biotech side

997
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,480
um you know if um someone wants to

998
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,679
really get deep into it and

999
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,360
uh maybe has a little more of a

1000
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,679
background i would read jay keys link's

1001
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:05,199
paper from 2018 on the the biotech

1002
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,840
production of cannabinoids that's a

1003
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,038
that's a

1004
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,000
excellent one obviously um so personally

1005
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,440
um

1006
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,839
i i left dimitrix um about middle of

1007
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,200
this

1008
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,038
uh last year in 2020 um entirely for a

1009
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,240
personal opportunity i got the chance to

1010
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,679
do another startup i love

1011
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,440
i love doing startups so when i joined

1012
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,120
dimitrix i was i think the fourth

1013
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,120
fourth employee there you know that

1014
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,719
there was no lab it was empty

1015
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,479
we had to build everything from scratch

1016
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,440
and i love that early phase where you're

1017
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,519
going from

1018
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,200
from zero production to something it's a

1019
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,000
you know that first step is an infinite

1020
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,798
increase right

1021
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,599
so uh so that's really exciting to me

1022
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:42,798
and i like building

1023
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:44,158
building out an early r d team and so um

1024
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,679
yeah about the middle of last year i got

1025
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,840
the opportunity to do that at a new

1026
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,679
company that's called sistina

1027
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:53,038
and um sistina is also in the industrial

1028
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,880
well in the it will call the synthetic

1029
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,480
biology space similar to demetrics we're

1030
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,919
not doing cannabinoids

1031
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,000
um i think what's really interesting

1032
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,519
about systena is that we're we're

1033
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,640
focused on kind of

1034
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:08,320
miniaturizing the the r d

1035
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,200
uh process so a lot of the discovery and

1036
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
work in r d

1037
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,118
is done in what are called 96 well

1038
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,878
plates which are kind of like 96 tiny

1039
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,358
flasks that you can grow

1040
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,159
grow cells in and what sistine is doing

1041
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,960
is that they're

1042
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,559
they're trying to move away from those

1043
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,320
plates which physically take up a lot of

1044
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,519
space and limit the number of

1045
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,960
variants of these strains you're

1046
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,280
building you can look at and move into

1047
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,679
single cell technologies

1048
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,919
and so now instead of having cells

1049
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,000
growing in 96 well plates you have cells

1050
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,759
inside of droplets or single cells and

1051
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,199
there's a number of ways to do it

1052
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,280
so that's one piece of it and the other

1053
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,598
piece of it is that

1054
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,599
we're partnered with a company called

1055
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,879
inscripta which has made this

1056
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,879
gene editing box called the onyx and the

1057
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,719
onyx allows for this you know massively

1058
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,799
multi-parallel genome editing where you

1059
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,199
can basically

1060
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,800
redesign entire genomes in microbes like

1061
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,078
yeast and so it's really powerful and

1062
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,240
allows us to

1063
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,000
get really deep into the biology that

1064
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:07,519
influences the production of these

1065
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,119
these biotech target molecules and so

1066
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,639
um you know this was those two things i

1067
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,640
think were really exciting to me and so

1068
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,679
i i jumped at the opportunity to do that

1069
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,838
and um

1070
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,519
we're at this point you know running a

1071
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:19,039
screening operation the lab is up and

1072
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,838
going and

1073
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,838
having a great time

1074
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,639
well that sounds amazing and i will

1075
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,639
certainly put links to the resources

1076
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,239
that you that you mentioned into the

1077
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,199
show description so if anyone's

1078
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,078
interested
