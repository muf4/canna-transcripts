1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,660
I'm certainly a cannabinoid fan probably

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,099
more well known for my interest in

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,519
terpenes

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,138
um I think you know fully wholeheartedly

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,000
embracing the Entourage and Ensemble

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,519
effects I think all of them are

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,259
important more of them together are

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,160
probably more efficacious than one by

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,960
itself

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,399
but today I'm going to talk a little bit

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,740
more about what we're seeing in the

12
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,559
cannabinoid space predominantly in the

13
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,518
hemp derived cannabinoid space and as we

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,379
know there are many different

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,019
cannabinoids certainly won't try and

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,479
cover all of them and there's the major

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,920
actors and some of the you know more

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,000
emerging ones like Ethan was just

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,120
highlighting

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,659
and some of the more common minor ones

21
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,919
like he had mentioned CBG cbga CBN and

22
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:48,898
thcv

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,719
but what we're starting to see in the

24
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,879
marketplace which I will highlight is a

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,340
highly unregulated Marketplace I will

26
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:59,159
definitely Echo Ethan's frustrations and

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,160
concerns with legislators lawmakers and

28
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,378
Regulators science moves at a much more

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,599
rapid Pace than any of them seem to be

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,219
able to do so

31
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,959
despite our yelling at them screaming at

32
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,379
them trying to converse with them and

33
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,179
really adamantly talking to them

34
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:17,879
just time and time again about problems

35
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,040
that we may see coming as Science and

36
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,959
Technology advances much more rapidly

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,360
than the law and regulation

38
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,158
and what we're seeing today are more of

39
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,039
these hemp derived cannabinoids so the

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,100
2018 Farm Bill put the lovely word

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,200
derivative in the language and as a

42
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,658
chemist we also started to light up

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,040
saying how might we derivatize some of

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,799
these molecules

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,299
um what might this open or entail and

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,360
what we're seeing today are some of the

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,220
ones listed on the bottom of the slide

48
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,560
I'll try to not have to pronounce every

49
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,298
single one of them

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,579
but there certainly is a large plethora

51
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,979
of them and the lettering and the

52
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:58,139
numbering and naming start to get rather

53
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:01,140
dizzying even for a chemist such as

54
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,359
myself so I can appreciate you know the

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,939
lawmaker in regulator position when they

56
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,859
say I don't understand chemistry I

57
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:09,538
failed Math and Science in in high

58
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,699
school and didn't even take much of it

59
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,979
in college so what am I supposed to do

60
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,799
about trying to write legislation or

61
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,479
regulation around these things we try to

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,700
comfort them and say here's some copy

63
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,639
paste language it sometimes goes over

64
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,159
well sometimes does not not but they

65
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,958
hear from everyone in the industry and

66
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,359
unfortunately there are some folks with

67
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,280
very strong lobbying efforts very large

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,020
amounts of financial resources that can

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,780
keep getting the conversations time and

70
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,000
time again and they are saying there's

71
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,959
no problems don't worry everything's

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,900
fine

73
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,120
um please let things persist as is and I

74
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,680
think in the absence of Regulation we

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,259
have seen that in the Cannabis industry

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,019
we know that there are Purity problems

77
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:54,419
there are mislabeling problems there are

78
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,340
all sorts of issues that arise that are

79
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,659
not to the benefit of a consumer and

80
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,019
especially not to the benefit of

81
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:03,659
patients so we can't continue to operate

82
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,519
in a space with no laws that are clear

83
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,739
and no regulations that are really

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,019
helping to Define how these products

85
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,219
should be produced and managed and

86
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,219
introduced to the public

87
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,759
um so there are you know a small problem

88
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,158
here as a chemist there was an old

89
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,598
numbering system and this shows the

90
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,699
numbering systems I'll just highlight

91
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,560
the the three and the four

92
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,598
um because the numbering system around

93
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,939
the ring changes

94
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,098
um into what we see today so this is the

95
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,759
more monitoring numbering system based

96
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:36,959
on some technical chemistry positions

97
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,598
and we're familiar with what's up here

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,699
is shown as Delta 9 THC

99
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,979
and so you'll see around the ring

100
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,658
structure here

101
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:47,518
there are many isomers this is where you

102
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,859
get Delta eight when you go and move the

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,439
double bond from nine to ten to eight to

104
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,000
nine there are many other derivatives

105
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,400
you can pretty much walk that double

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,739
bond all the way around the ring and see

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,860
one of those is probably out there in

108
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,378
some fashion some of them are more

109
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,360
thermodynamically favorable to form or

110
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:09,378
produce than others so some might be

111
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,420
much more easily accessible than others

112
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:14,818
certain derivatives are probably more

113
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,879
plentiful because of that that's just

114
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:20,759
the physical nature of chemistry

115
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:25,259
we are also seeing derivatization on the

116
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:27,899
phenolic Oh by acetylation so forming

117
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,000
acetates things like that so we have

118
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,459
that as another functional point in the

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,279
molecule that we can see derivatization

120
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,779
and the other aspects of some of these

121
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,698
compounds that are out here are

122
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:41,039
aliphatic chain lengths so you just

123
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,379
heard about thcv that's when the chain

124
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,939
length is shorter there are also some

125
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:47,519
other ones out there in the marketplace

126
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,500
now where the chain length is longer and

127
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,240
I'm going to try and describe a little

128
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,060
bit of each of these

129
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,900
so when you look around the ring up here

130
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,079
you'll see the isomers such as Delta 8

131
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:03,179
Delta 10 Delta 7 Delta 11 and this is

132
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,519
where it's the little funny part Delta

133
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,879
three or Delta 4 which would be the 10A

134
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,799
or 6A positions and the number is where

135
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,139
the double bond starts

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,800
um just for the nomenclature

137
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,259
so you can make Delta a THC from Delta 9

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,759
THC you can also make pretty much any of

139
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:25,439
these from CBD so hemp Farmers

140
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,319
overproduced there was a lot more hype

141
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:32,399
and interest in cultivating CBD it is

142
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:36,000
very easy to manufacture and isolate CBD

143
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,739
isolate in high Purity so CBD is a solid

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,660
that's very friendly from a

145
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,000
manufacturing standpoint to isolate with

146
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,699
high purities I can recrystallize it I

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,100
can get it to come out and filter it THC

148
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,319
Delta 9 THC by itself is a highly

149
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,600
viscous sticky oil so I don't have the

150
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,180
ability to recrystallize it or make it a

151
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,100
high Purity solid I'm trying to distill

152
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,600
it and often there are a few other

153
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,000
either minor cannabinoids or other

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,820
components that go with it you can see

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,538
you know typical THC purities in the

156
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:08,639
marketplace in the 90s 85 to 90 percent

157
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:10,918
sometimes a little over 90 percent but

158
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,519
you can't see the same Purity as you can

159
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,839
with CBD so I can get CBD at 99 plus

160
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,819
percent

161
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,638
um it's readily available it's extremely

162
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,620
cost effective as a chemical synthon so

163
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,180
now that that's out there the current

164
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,939
estimates that we're hearing are about

165
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,160
75 of the CBD in the marketplace is

166
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:30,959
being derivatized to Delta 8 or even

167
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,759
Delta 9 THC

168
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,500
depending upon how you try and control

169
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,600
the chemistry you can get the

170
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,560
cyclization happen and you can land at

171
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,300
Delta 9 or Delta 8 THC so poor Farmers

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,579
had to get rid of their compounds in

173
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,639
some fashion they had overproduced and

174
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,899
we see this rise in Delta 8 THC types of

175
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,639
products

176
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,560
I don't think it's the molecules

177
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,478
sometimes that we should think you know

178
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,459
could be demonized I think Delta 9

179
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,439
obviously we know much about Delta eight

180
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,879
I think has wonderful physiological

181
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,219
properties I think there's great

182
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,100
potential for that it's a little bit

183
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,199
akin to a hybrid between Delta 9 THC and

184
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,240
CBD

185
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,699
slightly lower psychoactivity potentials

186
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,019
it could be very beneficial for some and

187
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,379
some folks are saying it's their

188
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:18,060
medicine of choice so I think we know a

189
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,259
little bit more about that one than some

190
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,839
of these other derivatives from

191
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,819
Medicinal Chemistry studies or other

192
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,500
types of you know pharmacophoric

193
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,439
perspectives that the pharmaceutical

194
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,478
industry has performed over many years

195
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,639
it's not quite as studied as Delta 9 but

196
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,139
I'm a little bit more of a fan of Delta

197
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,699
8 and some of the other derivatives

198
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,139
because we know a little bit more about

199
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,199
it today

200
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,300
the question becomes what have I used to

201
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,538
make it and what might be left with it

202
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,800
so what's the end purity of the product

203
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:48,418
and are there any other you know

204
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
cannabinoid or cannabinoid-like

205
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,198
impurities or are there any of the

206
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,179
reagents that were used in this type of

207
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,680
transformation that might be present as

208
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,840
well

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,699
um and it was funny to kind of look back

210
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:05,579
from my perspective at UCLA in 2018

211
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:07,379
in can Med I presented this exact slide

212
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,740
it was the last slide in my slide set

213
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:13,500
and we talked about Delta eight we

214
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,560
penned a white paper on Delta 8 THC in

215
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,839
2018 when we saw the the farm bill

216
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,280
language we knew that this might be

217
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,138
coming

218
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,019
um it didn't quite expect it would be

219
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:27,300
coming as much as I've seen today

220
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,639
um but you know our concern then was

221
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,860
what you see here what else is going

222
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,479
with it so I'll call it a Delta a

223
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,418
product or someone will call it a Delta

224
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,658
a product but what else was there and

225
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:41,639
what we saw in a one sample in Oregon is

226
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,019
highlighted in Orange where you've got

227
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,720
other things that are obviously

228
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,240
cannabinoid like molecules

229
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,399
um a much better representation is the

230
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,580
blue line where you have a little bit of

231
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,458
CBN and I'll caution this is diode array

232
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,320
detection CBN lights up a lot greater

233
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,518
than the other cannabinoids because of

234
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
the wavelength that you're using when

235
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,019
you do detection so it's not a

236
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,180
quantitative picture but the unknowns

237
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,159
are obviously much more present in the

238
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,319
orange sample than in the blue one

239
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,059
and this was the concern what else is

240
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,820
going with it what else was made in the

241
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:17,278
manufacturing process today in Oregon

242
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,080
the regulator has tried to stop the

243
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,759
introduction of Delta 8 and other

244
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,339
synthetic cannabinoids in their

245
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,620
regulated supply chain they had found

246
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,680
most Delta 8 on their Marketplace was

247
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,360
between 70 to 85 percent impurity and it

248
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,000
just begs the question what's the other

249
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,580
15 to 30 percent is it an unknown

250
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,259
cannabinoid is it some other impurity is

251
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,120
it something that could be highly toxic

252
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,000
is it something that may even be better

253
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,860
for us simply because we don't know we

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,080
really shouldn't permit those in the

255
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,000
marketplace or in the product streams

256
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,820
they've tried to set up a system where

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,100
we might be able to introduce Regulators

258
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,620
approving a process I think that's more

259
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,300
of a sensible approach if this molecule

260
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,980
seems to be okay and we're okay with

261
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,139
that being in the marketplace then how

262
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,759
has it been made and how do we monitor

263
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,860
that process and know the impurities

264
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,799
that go with it and that's a major

265
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,959
reason the FDA exists so in the absence

266
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,639
of federal regulations doing these types

267
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,099
of things which they do for

268
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,899
pharmaceutical apis and you know all the

269
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,300
time we're going to require State

270
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,600
Regulators to try and grapple with this

271
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:24,179
problem or send folks into the field to

272
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,000
identify processes now Oregon has said

273
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:29,879
if you've got a new dietary ingredient

274
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,940
process if you've got a molecule under

275
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,100
grass status or self-affirmed grass then

276
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,080
you might be able to say that process

277
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,639
has been approved in a federal sense and

278
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,700
that would be acceptable to introduce

279
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,838
into the Oregon regulated Supply stream

280
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,519
they specifically carved out CBN as well

281
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,079
for some other reasons but there was a

282
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,519
lot of CBN already in the marketplace

283
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,458
and they think that that one might have

284
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,200
been a little bit more acceptable as a

285
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,879
synthetic chemist I don't know if that's

286
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,940
necessarily true the manufacturing

287
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,500
methods to CBN depending how you try and

288
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,779
get there could actually create a large

289
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,679
number of impurities

290
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:07,439
foreign

291
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,239
so these are kind of the two that I'm

292
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,320
maybe a little more worried about um

293
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,680
there's some others I'm much more

294
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,140
worried about but the hhc the fully

295
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:20,039
hydrogenated version where there's no

296
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:22,078
um double bonds left and CBN so these

297
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,838
come from Delta eight or Delta 9 and

298
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,819
hydrogenation to perform hydrogenation

299
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,040
and and quickly my background is a

300
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,839
synthetic chemist so I'm pretty well

301
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,000
versed in these manufacturing methods I

302
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,040
performed hydrogenation methods myself

303
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,440
in graduate school

304
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,599
you require a catalyst it's typically

305
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,220
Palladium or platinum sometimes it can

306
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,420
be some other exotic metals that are

307
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,160
used but those are really concerning as

308
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,439
to what levels of those are being left

309
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,480
in the products no Cannabis Testing Lab

310
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,940
that I am aware of is testing for a

311
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,120
trace Palladium Platinum runny you know

312
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,640
catalytic process reagents that may be

313
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,100
used in a hydrogenation process

314
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:06,720
so the FDA very tightly scrutinizes

315
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,480
hydrogenation methods it's a very common

316
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,040
last step in a lot of apis it is

317
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,720
something that can be managed and is

318
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,519
watched but you have to be very careful

319
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,620
that your Palladium Catalyst has not

320
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,419
stuck to your product it's not leaching

321
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,100
into your end product and no one here

322
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,860
that I am aware of is currently watching

323
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,839
that today that's a great concern so

324
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,240
understanding the process and how we get

325
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,399
there what of those reagents might be

326
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,600
left in the product is really of great

327
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,600
concern

328
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,740
I put the asterisks up there because

329
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,240
hydrogenation happens from the top or

330
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,860
the bottom of the molecule and you'll

331
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
create a chiral Center here so you'll

332
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,000
have a right hand left hand type of

333
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,620
problem you definitely have different

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,480
physiological activities sometimes you

335
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,339
can have catastrophic types of

336
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,500
physiological activities such as the

337
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,720
case of thalidomide so understanding

338
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,299
your enantiomers may be very important

339
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,278
as well when you leave the double bond

340
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,679
in Delta 9 and Delta 8 you don't have

341
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,299
that rasamate problem when it starts

342
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,578
walking around the ring you start to

343
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,319
generate the problem as well so now we

344
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:05,458
have complex mixtures of problems we're

345
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,040
going to need much more Advanced

346
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:10,379
Analytical methodologies to discern what

347
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,299
is this mixture over that mixture some

348
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,578
of them may have better medical efficacy

349
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:17,219
than others some of them may generate

350
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:19,078
unwanted toxicities we really don't know

351
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,540
and I think it's really more incumbent

352
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,638
upon us to say let's slow the train down

353
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,519
a little bit and start to understand at

354
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,959
least from a toxicological perspective

355
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,659
what are we introducing into this Grand

356
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,399
human experiment that we're running the

357
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,319
you know the scientific train and

358
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,078
Manufacturing abilities are greatly

359
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,899
ahead of legislation and regulation

360
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:41,638
this is the structure of CBN

361
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,919
um I think we're probably far less

362
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,360
concerned about its physiological

363
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,939
activity because it doesn't cause

364
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,860
potential psychoactivities

365
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,440
um I think it's you know potentially

366
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,039
okay from a metabolic standpoint I worry

367
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,079
about hhc's metabolic abilities so most

368
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,879
of the metabolisms are allylic

369
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,759
oxidations you need the double bond

370
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,519
present to facilitate oxidation and then

371
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,860
eventual clearance from the body I'm not

372
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,240
aware of the metabolic fates of hhc I

373
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,278
don't know if they've been fully studied

374
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,440
and it starts to you know make you

375
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,360
question will this build up to toxic

376
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,980
levels in the body might it become a

377
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,839
problem if I chronically use it over

378
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,519
time certainly at larger and larger

379
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,740
doses how much of an issue might it be

380
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,320
we're aware of you know complications

381
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,480
with CBD and liver potential toxicities

382
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,760
we're aware cannabinoids have to go

383
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,399
through the cytochromes to you know be

384
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,319
metabolized and excreted what happens to

385
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,078
ones that really May potentially lock

386
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,000
that system up or be you know very proud

387
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:42,739
problematic I think those are still

388
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,740
somewhat unknown questions as well

389
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:48,000
um the acetates I'm also not a

390
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,440
significant fan of we have some big

391
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,839
problems with that in a couple of

392
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,399
different ways and I apologize it

393
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,199
shouldn't be acetylized I think the

394
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,820
industry and my toddlers keeping me up

395
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,799
too late at night got into me it's

396
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,019
acetylate

397
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,419
um a set of Lies is not a word so I

398
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:05,399
apologize for the error on the slide

399
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,979
this is a simple chemical transformation

400
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,259
I just have to take the phenol boil it

401
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,879
in acetic anhydride and I can make an

402
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,439
acetate

403
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,879
um there are probably even other

404
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,560
acetates that I might be able to make

405
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,740
and that starts to beg the question how

406
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,479
many of those might be okay or not it's

407
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,759
akin to the manufacturing method of

408
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,379
taking morphine to heroin so we know

409
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,240
that there are huge differences in that

410
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,159
they now cross the blood-brain barrier

411
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,600
in very different ways and there are

412
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,838
great concerns about these types of

413
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,940
things being in you know in the body I

414
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,740
think the bigger problem with this is we

415
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,680
now know phenolic acetate such as

416
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,539
Vitamin E acetate cause the cases of a

417
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,039
valley so when you heat these up to

418
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,958
certain temperatures they'll degrade

419
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:48,240
into a molecule called ketine which is

420
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,819
highly reactive and that caused a

421
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,820
significant lung um you know abrasions

422
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,639
and problems so these products inside of

423
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,980
an inhalation product could be

424
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,539
catastrophic I'm not a fan of allowing

425
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,159
any of these I don't think they're not

426
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:03,419
naturally occurring they're not found in

427
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,338
the cannabis plant they really don't

428
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,039
make much sense they're completely new

429
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:10,740
molecular entities probably don't have

430
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,899
great place inside of our regulated

431
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,339
Supply stream right now we have plenty

432
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,958
of other good cannabinoids to deal with

433
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,820
that we're not tapping into let's stick

434
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:20,759
to the Natural ones

435
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,500
the aliphatic variants the reason these

436
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,559
are starting to show up is because they

437
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,240
improve their potency at CB1 and they

438
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,458
start to become much much more

439
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,039
psychoactive and at least are touted as

440
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,979
being 30 times stronger than THC itself

441
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,439
or thcp

442
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,940
so as you get longer in the chain you

443
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,860
can start to see that increase there is

444
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,199
a length limit it starts to decrease as

445
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,940
well but this is why you'll start to see

446
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,419
six seven and eight carbon lengths

447
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,639
greater than the THC one that has five

448
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:52,740
doing some of the math if you have some

449
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,539
of these present at 0.1 percent in hemp

450
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,879
it might take you ten thousand dollars

451
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,399
worth of raw material to produce a kilo

452
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,259
of extract and that's before you go

453
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,000
about doing the manufacturing methods or

454
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,798
isolations to go ahead and bring these

455
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,779
products to Market so when they're

456
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,099
selling for eight nine ten thousand

457
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:09,539
dollars a kilo

458
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,759
doesn't make me think that they're being

459
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,798
derived from him I'm not aware of any

460
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,119
hemp cultivars that are actually present

461
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:16,740
with

462
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,779
um you know appreciable amounts of these

463
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,699
molecules either so while they may have

464
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,379
been found in Trace Amounts we have not

465
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,640
used them in larger amounts we're not

466
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,919
putting 80 percent of those in

467
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,259
concentrates we're starting to venture

468
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,840
into a realm where these are not really

469
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,400
understood or well known and again I

470
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,619
believe these are probably more than

471
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,419
likely being synthetically derived and

472
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:37,678
not being extracted from hem although

473
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,120
all the web pages will tell you

474
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,740
differently

475
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,139
so what do you see in the marketplace

476
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:47,099
today it's frightening if you just start

477
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:49,080
putting in you know THC H THC JD thcl

478
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,480
like just start looking up some of these

479
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,859
websites and you'll see some of these

480
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,179
products are throwing everything and

481
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:55,798
anything in between

482
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,259
um to try and say my products more

483
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,240
potent my products differentiated and

484
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:02,640
you can buy them online there's no age

485
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,500
gating systems or kind of they're hoping

486
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,320
you have a credit card

487
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,480
um there is fancy packaging things that

488
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,220
may be attractive to children and it's

489
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,558
starting to blow back on the rest of the

490
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,058
industry so the poor licensed operators

491
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,339
that have been operating within the

492
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:19,440
states desperately trying to follow

493
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:22,259
hundreds of pages of regulations and

494
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,298
complex laws are being you know forced

495
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,519
to combat folks that don't pay the same

496
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:29,400
taxes don't have the same regulatory

497
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,839
scrutiny can't lose their license and

498
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,419
don't even have to care what's on their

499
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,339
packaging I think that's exceptionally

500
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,840
unfair it's not rewarding to those that

501
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:39,538
have been carving this difficult path

502
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,579
for patients and other consumers and to

503
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:43,500
see products like this available at what

504
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,319
could be a gas station or a grocery

505
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,000
store or anywhere you know I mentioned I

506
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,918
have toddlers I have you know kids

507
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,900
around me all the time it is a grave

508
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,600
concern to me and to many others like

509
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,220
myself what are these things why are

510
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,798
they available and why can't we do

511
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,019
something to stop it

512
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,779
um so how do we regulate it

513
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:07,259
I don't know this is like a good shot at

514
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:09,599
maybe a good guess to start with

515
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:12,298
um you know Delta nine THC which we know

516
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,918
is ranked as number six you can't

517
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:15,900
compare directly

518
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,940
um Ki values or inhibitory constant

519
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,440
values at CB1 because they're not always

520
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,900
done in the same models they're not

521
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,640
always done in all these molecules so I

522
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,559
tried to take that and with some help

523
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,419
from chatgpt who doesn't know science

524
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:28,918
very well either

525
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,419
um you know I just kept trying to think

526
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,340
it through think it through and think it

527
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,380
through and came up with you know

528
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:36,418
somewhat of a picture from a lot of

529
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,299
anecdotal insights a lot of what folks

530
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:41,220
will tell you or Post online and some of

531
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:42,538
what we know from General pharmacophoric

532
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,940
structures and some of what we

533
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:47,038
understand from actual use within the

534
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,900
Cannabis industry so this is a guess

535
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,359
this is not etched in stone is supposed

536
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,280
to start conversation and I think this

537
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,918
is what The Regulators may need to say

538
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,899
how do we start somewhere so we can't

539
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,419
say no to all of them we definitely want

540
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,759
some of them naturally occurring ones

541
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:04,559
that's seems okay unless they seem to be

542
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,798
too potent or not actually being

543
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,960
isolated from the plant the approved

544
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,418
column is saying the regulator should

545
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,038
approve the process because the molecule

546
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:17,100
might be okay but how did you get there

547
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:19,379
is a more concern and I really think

548
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,000
that there's a lot to be had in a

549
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,580
complex slide like this a lot of

550
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,500
questions that are you know arising but

551
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,119
lawmakers and Regulators especially in

552
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,160
California today are trying to figure

553
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,739
out how do I grapple with this problem

554
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,120
what should I allow or not allow and I'm

555
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,440
sure the federal regulators and

556
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,058
lawmakers are thinking about it with

557
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,120
rewriting the farm bill this year as

558
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:40,859
well this again is not etched in stone

559
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,379
it's for conversation there are some

560
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:45,119
question marks here some of those are

561
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,919
naturally occurring I think the

562
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,079
cannabinoid acids don't have the potency

563
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,700
problem but if you say all cannabinoid

564
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,439
acids are allowed we'll start to make

565
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,600
the acids and then they'll decarboxylate

566
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,700
them at home in inhalation devices and

567
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,678
you might have the same problem so it's

568
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,500
a very sticky Wicked and challenging

569
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,660
problem with a lot of molecular are in

570
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,640
technical complexities but it's one I

571
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,140
think that is present upon us today and

572
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,419
one that we have to take upon ourselves

573
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,220
to really work together and say how can

574
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,538
we best regulate these to allow the

575
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,000
molecules that are beneficial to

576
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,859
patients good for consumers but at the

577
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,839
right Purity and potencies and labeled

578
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,058
properly so that we aren't harming

579
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,259
anybody inadvertently because when they

580
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:24,178
see they're tested they think they're

581
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,859
tested for everything and we just have

582
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:28,940
to be conscious of that

583
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,939
thank you for your time

584
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,380
sure yeah I'll take a question for sure

585
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,980
thank you what a wonderful talk and so

586
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,960
eye-opening as a clinician I you know I

587
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,819
know when the a valley thing happened it

588
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,740
was like we're not testing for the

589
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:54,480
Vitamin E acetate so we didn't know but

590
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,798
I'm curious

591
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,599
do you think there's going to be any

592
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:58,859
work this year with the farm bill since

593
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,599
it we're coming up on the five-year

594
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,219
anniversary do you think some you know

595
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,500
because what I'm seeing now is in the

596
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,319
marketplace THC at five to ten

597
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,000
milligrams of temp Drive THC which in

598
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,279
some ways is a clinician I appreciate

599
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,259
because it's easily accessible for

600
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,538
patients you know in in states that

601
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,359
don't have it but you know then I see

602
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:20,279
this talk and I'm you know scared so do

603
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:21,479
you think there's any any talks right

604
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:23,279
now about the hemp build do you have any

605
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,079
insights around that and changes thank

606
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,700
you yeah there are a lot of folks

607
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,859
talking about the farm bill I think

608
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,120
there's an effort towards aiming to

609
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:32,519
regulate

610
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:36,479
um THC amounts so the farm bill says

611
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:38,639
0.38 THC that was meant for biomass not

612
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,620
for manufactured products because if I

613
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,679
make you know a granola bar or brownie

614
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:45,779
or chocolate bar and I say it's 0.38 THC

615
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,159
I can have potencies and products that

616
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,960
are much stronger than what's allowed in

617
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,280
the regulated market it's just a simple

618
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,259
math game I'll just make the product

619
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,058
bigger and also I've got 30 or 300

620
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:55,679
milligrams in one unit I don't want

621
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:57,538
anyone getting that at a gas station

622
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,159
that's ridiculous and that was not the

623
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,839
intent I think of the law they just

624
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,159
didn't know what they were writing and

625
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,899
in the absence of regulations

626
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,400
everybody's points to point three weight

627
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,038
percent which is why they think there's

628
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,259
some legal precedent to allow them

629
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,579
um to have those products the DEA is

630
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:13,500
like we don't think that was the case

631
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,720
we've kind of they've kind of said you

632
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,220
know HHS has said hey you guys need to

633
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,259
regulate this or take some sort of look

634
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,880
at it so I think everyone's aware of

635
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:22,440
their problem and they hopefully will

636
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,659
come out with a total milligram

637
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,460
allowance in hemp regulated products

638
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:28,080
something that you can analytically test

639
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,460
for something that you could Monitor and

640
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,079
label properly and something that

641
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,919
doesn't hurt all the legal State

642
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:37,199
operators on the Delta 19 she said

643
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,400
I hope I can't promise and you won't

644
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,840
know until like the last second when

645
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,640
someone finally says okay the Bill's

646
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,639
going to pass

647
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:48,480
sure hi uh from one organic chemist or

648
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,038
the other um how do they make THC p and

649
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,558
the other lymphatic chain length

650
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:55,200
derivatives

651
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:56,940
are done with the levitolic acid and um

652
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,620
you just stick it together so take a

653
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,120
levitol but it's a derivative of a live

654
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:01,859
at all and that's the longer chain and

655
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,719
then you just stick it to the duranal

656
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,939
group okay so you're just resourcing all

657
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,740
uh stuff yeah okay yeah so it's a simple

658
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,779
synthetic process it's not too

659
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:13,259
complicated but no derivativeization of

660
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:16,019
CBDs but fully synthetic correct okay

661
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:18,419
thank you Jeff um can you hear me sure

662
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:21,418
um thank you and always thank you for

663
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:23,880
answering my many texts and emails and

664
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,860
learning from you always

665
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,960
so my question is

666
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:29,639
um about what you think and I don't mean

667
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,440
to put you on the spot but there were

668
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,500
two cases that were published in

669
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,200
literature in December 22 of a 20 year

670
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,779
old and I think a 35 year old that were

671
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,600
both in separate cases but presented to

672
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,519
the same hospital with psychosis

673
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,279
suicidal ideation and what they called

674
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,558
refractory depression after using Delta

675
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,558
eight products and I believe it was in

676
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:56,220
Colorado my question to you is do we

677
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:59,158
have any idea which compound in this mix

678
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,140
might be causing those or is it more

679
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,760
than one compound I don't think it's the

680
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,860
Delta eight

681
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,379
I'm with you in that I don't think it's

682
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:10,079
the Delta 8 itself I mean it may be

683
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,059
right we can't rule that out but I can't

684
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,619
find analytical data on the products

685
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:15,119
that they've had they don't allow anyone

686
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:16,918
to really scrutinize that for every

687
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,139
other minor cannabinoid or impurity

688
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,000
that's there but it does beg the

689
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,559
question was it the impurities or

690
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,900
something else in those manufacturing

691
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,240
processes that cause that

692
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,100
um you know much like spice and K2 we

693
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,079
know if you lock up the endocannabinoid

694
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:32,819
system you can have huge problems I

695
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,139
think that's the concern with thcp and

696
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:36,298
some of the other ones when they're so

697
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,059
strongly binding you can lock the system

698
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:40,440
up and have catastrophic issues are some

699
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:42,240
of these metabolic or some of these

700
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,940
synthetic impurities causing the same

701
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,220
problem they're cannabinoid like so they

702
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,600
could do so but in the absence of great

703
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,179
analytical understanding of those

704
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,740
products and that I mean I kind of doubt

705
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,019
those were the only two people to take

706
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,538
that product so you know you're seeing

707
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,579
probably out of a population there's you

708
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:01,259
know never 100 you know perfection in

709
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:03,298
some of those but it does beg the

710
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,980
question it's most likely not to eight

711
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:07,139
it's probably one of the other synthetic

712
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,599
impurities on how they got there

713
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,520
but we don't know

714
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,519
maybe time for one more sure

715
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,740
um

716
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:22,678
are the cannabinoids hemp derived and

717
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,278
marijuana derived the same

718
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:28,380
it's all cannabis to me

719
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,599
sorry as a scientist right it's Cannabis

720
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,419
sativa L we call it hemp or marijuana

721
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,519
for legal and tax definitions

722
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,960
um so you know which is horrific from a

723
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,579
scientific standpoint and probably to

724
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,860
everyone in this room

725
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:42,960
um hemp derived as saying I came from a

726
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,178
cultivar that was high in CBD and low in

727
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,480
THC marijuana would be one that has

728
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:51,840
higher than 0.38 THC it may also have

729
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,759
some CBD and other ones as a chemist all

730
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,740
the molecules are here it may be more

731
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,500
advantageous to go from one that is

732
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,140
higher in one cannabinoid and expressed

733
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,419
in a large amount so if I have 20 CBD

734
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,940
isolating that CBD is much easier from

735
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:08,038
that but legally I'm trying to call it

736
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,720
hemp derived so I can skirt the state

737
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:11,819
laws and I can just go out there and

738
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,100
sell it online

739
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:15,960
chemist point of view

740
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,658
a business point of view it's an

741
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,579
economic Factor yeah oh yeah it's a huge

742
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,039
economic piece yeah

743
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:24,839
Jeffrey could I get one more

744
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,460
uh sure

745
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:28,678
um I'm going to be meeting in Sacramento

746
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,380
with some of the state legislators for

747
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,659
uh bills they've actually been really

748
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,278
good I've had some very good

749
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,960
conversations with them I think some of

750
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,480
them want to hear some of them are just

751
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,759
like I have no idea please help me

752
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,038
um others are like I don't know

753
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,900
um it's a crap shoot uh what I was going

754
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:48,058
to ask was like what is your short and

755
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,940
sweet uh or when I meet him because

756
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:52,859
we've usually got about like 15 minutes

757
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,720
uh and I'll visit several offices but I

758
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:55,859
get to talk to the chair people uh the

759
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,579
Committees that are seeing those bills

760
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:58,798
through

761
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:01,199
try to listen to the diverse array of

762
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,298
Industry not just one Industry Group see

763
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,640
if they are coalesced around a topic

764
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:07,259
protect those that have state licenses

765
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,419
because they've been working so hard to

766
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:12,119
do so and the question is should we

767
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:14,278
allow hemp ingredients into California's

768
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,719
regulated Supply stream that's where

769
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,240
they're being tested and labeled that's

770
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,980
where the rules apply I think pushing

771
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,538
everything into a cannabinoid centers of

772
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,360
excellence we might eventually call

773
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:25,859
these dispensaries makes more sense

774
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,778
because people should be more informed

775
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:29,219
about cannabinoid cannabinoid therapies

776
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:31,200
and that's where I'm kind of going to

777
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,940
expect I'll have these things and I

778
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,740
wouldn't find something you know at a

779
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,298
smoke shop or a gas station with someone

780
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,980
that just said go buy it because it's

781
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:40,619
supposed to be the strongest thing out

782
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,019
here I think putting it in a dispensary

783
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:45,178
makes much much more sense just from a

784
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:47,099
sociological standpoint good yeah that's

785
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:50,840
what they were looking at uh thank you

786
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:50,839
you're welcome thank you everyone
