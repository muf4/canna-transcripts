session

74
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:22,799
during this episode we dive into one of

75
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,480
those cannabinoids CBG also known as

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,480
cannabigirol

77
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,280
we discuss the following what makes CBG

78
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,518
one of Bonnie's favorite new

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,598
cannabinoids what makes CBG a bridge

80
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:40,500
cannabinoid between THC and CBD the

81
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:43,219
difference between cbga and CBG house

82
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,239
CBG enhances the body's natural

83
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:47,818
endocannabinoid system

84
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,180
how CVG Works in combination with other

85
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:53,878
cannabinoids conditions for which CBG is

86
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,819
a good fit potential adverse reactions

87
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,818
to CBG and Bonnie also provides a

88
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:01,859
preview of the cam Med medical practicum

89
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:03,719

112
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,959
good morning Bonnie thanks for joining

113
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,180
us on the podcast

114
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,159
thanks so much for having me again

115
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,500
yeah I know I'm very excited to talk to

116
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,320
you and have you back on the podcast for

117
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,240
the third time which makes you the

118
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,418
leader in can Med Coffee Talk podcast

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,519
appearances so congratulations oh thank

120
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:31,978
you and I think you may also hold the

121
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,500
title for can bed appearances too but

122
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,360
I'll have to research and get back to

123
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,120
you on that but in any case you're

124
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,759
presenting yet again at kmed23 about

125
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,680
Minor cannabinoids so I wanted to

126
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
discuss just one of those compounds with

127
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,780
you that you're going to be covering on

128
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,720
the talk and so we chose Canaveral or

129
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,638
CBG and I watched a YouTube video you

130
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,860
made about CBG in preparation for the

131
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,439
talk and at the time when you recorded

132
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,139
it you said it was one of your favorite

133
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:04,759
cannabinoids so my first question is why

134
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,759
is CBG one of your favorites

135
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,800
well it

136
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,060
to do

137
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:15,120
a lot of things that THC does and a lot

138
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,800
of things that CBD does but maybe a

139
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,418
little bit better kind of the bridge

140
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,460
between the two

141
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,318
it is

142
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:25,918
um not

143
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:30,720
um intoxicating or compa or impairing

144
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:34,379
it is it appears that lower doses can be

145
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,740
taken for when compared to CBD

146
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:40,199
it does appear to address some of the

147
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,199
main issues that people turn to cannabis

148
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,478
for which is anti-inflammatory pain

149
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,439
relief

150
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:46,978
anti-anxiety

151
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,279
um

152
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,079
even some sleep benefits have been

153
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,879
reported

154
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,680
antidepressant

155
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,360
also

156
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,579
anti-cancer so like it checks all the

157
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,060
boxes

158
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:05,219
and maybe lower Doses and that

159
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,038
non-impairing part will make it more

160
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,020
acceptable to people who either don't

161
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:13,620
like that or don't want to have the

162
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,538
impairing part but also don't have the

163
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,639
ability to pay for very high doses of

164
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:19,560
CBD

165
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,860
no and that's interesting you say it's a

166
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,038
bridge between THC and CBD because it is

167
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,560
a precursor for those molecules correct

168
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:32,399
well that's right so it's it's parent

169
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,180
compound cbga is kind of known as the

170
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,758
mother to all the cannabinoids

171
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,300
um in that it is the compound that's

172
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:46,199
found in the immature you know cannabis

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,060
flower that then uh based on the

174
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,520
genetics and of the plant and the

175
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,720
enzymes that it's exposed to does change

176
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,500
to cbda which then turns to CBD with

177
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,940
heat

178
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,978
and thca which then turns to THC with

179
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,259
heat

180
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:06,899
cbga hasn't really been studied very

181
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:09,360
much it's I would say it is highly

182
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:12,739
understudied and I bet that we will find

183
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,300
out that there are some very interesting

184
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,360
anti-inflammatory probably anti-cancer

185
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,240
properties we don't know yet fully but

186
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,220
at least CBG is being studied I mean I

187
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,960
constantly look at the literature and

188
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,379
just this year

189
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,959
in 2023 there's already a study

190
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:33,778
published from Israel on

191
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,120
um how CBG may be helpful for multiple

192
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:39,120
sclerosis and then there's another study

193
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,459
that looked at CBG on how the mechanism

194
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,379
of action

195
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,879
works for pain and inflammation so

196
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,200
there's a lot of interest in it which is

197
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,958
really exciting

198
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,640
yeah that is exciting and yeah when I

199
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,958
was watching that YouTube video there

200
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,639
were there was a lot of different

201
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,958
research that you that you went through

202
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,458
and I'll put a link in the show

203
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,539
description so people can check that out

204
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,579
so

205
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,439
um with so much promise for a lot of

206
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,778
different things for what conditions do

207
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,600
you think CBG maybe has the most promise

208
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:07,730
or are you most interested in

209
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,879
so I think

210
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,879
[Music]

211
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,879
um

212
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,339
previously I think for people who

213
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,639
struggle with inflammation pain

214
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:24,240
mood like sleep I'm sorry like uh

215
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,679
anxiety or depression CBG holds a lot of

216
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,980
Promise

217
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,439
um Ethan Russo did a survey along with

218
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,480
some other uh researchers

219
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,660
and they uh published their results and

220
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,000
they found that CBG and again this is

221
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:43,079
just a survey of people using CBG it's

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,899
one of the first reports out there on uh

223
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,080
what are people finding and it was

224
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,399
highly rated for anxiety pain depression

225
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,080
and sleep

226
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,940
and I don't know that it's a direct

227
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,300
sleep agent

228
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:00,120
but when you are having less anxiety and

229
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,759
less pain you likely will fall asleep a

230
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,980
little bit easier and maybe sleep better

231
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,600
it was highly rated by people over like

232
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,360
70 percent

233
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,040
of people said it was Superior to their

234
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,240
conventional medication

235
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:17,399
that's a pretty high number right and um

236
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,539
that shows a lot of promise for this and

237
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,039
again in in the research they have found

238
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,139
and this goes back a number of years

239
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,139
they found that CBG did have

240
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,720
anti-anxiety properties and mice

241
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:31,740
antidepressant properties also

242
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,600
anti-inflammatory pain relieving

243
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,039
properties so this is not something that

244
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,080
people are making up there is some

245
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,719
evidence to support that in the

246
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,000
pre-clinical research

247
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,480
excellent include that survey that you

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,639
mentioned is that CBG being taken by

249
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,500
itself or is it in combination with with

250
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,659
other cannabinoids that's a great

251
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,278
question I think in the survey they

252
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,019
tried to sort that out and it was people

253
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,480
taking

254
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:00,120
plant CBG

255
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,620
you know that they buy in the kind of

256
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,179
hemp Market because CBG most CBG

257
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:10,019
products that are on the market do not

258
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:12,179
contain a significant amount of THC they

259
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,278
are coming from hemp plants

260
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:15,778
and so they are readily available on the

261
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,439
hemp Market you know I've seen it as

262
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:21,299
flower I've seen it as topical

263
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
um and that's another point is that for

264
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,479
topical

265
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,659
um

266
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,060
it has antibacterial effects and it also

267
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:33,360
has like anti-what we call psoriatic

268
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:35,458
effects so psoriasis is a well-known

269
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,159
condition where people get not only

270
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,859
joint pain but they get skinned like

271
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,679
this um these plaques and scales on

272
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:48,240
their skin it can really be very

273
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:50,299
um difficult condition and CBG has these

274
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,159
they has been found to have these

275
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:56,219
anti-soriatic properties in that

276
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:58,939
it decreases the buildup of those scales

277
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,639
that acts on the skin cells themselves

278
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,980
and it inhibits

279
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,439
the proliferation of those scaly skin

280
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,459
cells which is really interesting

281
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,140
um

282
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,778
so

283
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,458
um

284
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:16,200
again I think this just goes to show the

285
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,939
applications of cannabinoids is very

286
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,680
widespread right and people always say

287
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,940
well how is it possible that these

288
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,819
compounds

289
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,220
can do so many things but they have

290
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,519
multiple Targets in the brain and body

291
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,778
and that's what makes them so amazing is

292
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,820
that there and remember the

293
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:35,879
pharmaceutical model is this medicine

294
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,560
addresses this specific Target

295
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,899
whereas cannabinoids are what we call

296
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:42,359
promiscuous they kind of they go to a

297
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,399
lot of targets

298
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,899
yeah no and and that's a good point and

299
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,519
that kind of brings up one of my next

300
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,220
questions is

301
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,259
how does CBG differ in its targets than

302
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,540
other cannabinoids are they working on

303
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,578
the same receptors and

304
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:59,639
and you know kind of the same mechanisms

305
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:01,679
of action as the other cannabinoids

306
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,299
so there's some overlap

307
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,299
the other actions of let's say th

308
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,419
c um some like opposite reactions so

309
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,639
like CBD and CBG have opposite reactions

310
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:16,139
at a specific serotonin receptor the

311
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,100
5ht1a

312
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:21,778
where CBD binds to it and CBG blocks it

313
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,940
right and

314
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:26,700
um so again they both act at that

315
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,920
receptor but differently sure they also

316
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:33,180
um CBG also

317
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:34,860
um like overlaps with CBD and in terms

318
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,019
of binding to what we call P par

319
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,940
receptors also at these what we call

320
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,299
Trip channels

321
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,579
um to help with inflammation and pain

322
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:46,679
one interesting thing about CBG is it so

323
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:48,599
far is the only cannabinoid that has

324
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,379
been found to work at the alpha

325
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,820
adrenergic receptor which is a receptor

326
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,379
well-known there's actually

327
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,360
Pharmaceuticals that Target that

328
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,379
receptor

329
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,419
um but

330
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,919
um you know importance for me is that

331
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,639
when you address that receptor you're

332
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,500
addressing pain inflammation and uh even

333
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,440
you know that's a target for some of the

334
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,778
medications for ADHD or for behavior

335
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,180
issues and so

336
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:16,919
um I have used CBG and some of my

337
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,859
patients with autism

338
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:23,879
and some families and again you have to

339
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:26,459
remember that we're all very similar but

340
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,439
we're different in the way we respond to

341
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,599
compounds that we put in our body I'm

342
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,160
sure you know people who can take a

343
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,959
particular medication and other people

344
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,458
if they take if they flip out right

345
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,559
there's some people think it's the best

346
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,539
thing ever and other people say uh I

347
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,578
can't take that at all it I took one

348
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:45,899
dose and I'll never take it again we

349
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:47,519
have such a wide uh such a um

350
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,159
uh what's the word I'm looking for like

351
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,740
I guess um

352
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:54,838
very varied way that we respond to

353
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,579
medication so again when I try it in

354
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,380
patients like just this morning I got an

355
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:00,899
email from a family said CBG made their

356
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,879
child way too hyper and that may be a

357
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,159
dosing issue so we're working on that

358
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,860
but in other families they're reporting

359
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,078
my child's calm has better focus even

360
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,539
speech is improving and some of the

361
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,000
children with autism who are non-verbal

362
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:18,299
so it's always a compound I consider

363
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,360
when I'm treating uh

364
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:24,299
um you know children who have either

365
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,639
Behavior or uh other types of

366
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,740
difficulties why not try it it's safe we

367
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,320
know that it's safe and it's under

368
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,480
medical supervision and we start with

369
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,459
very low doses so that we can control

370
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,778
what's going on

371
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,219
um and of course there's a lot of

372
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:39,659
oversight you know the parents are

373
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,720
watching I'm watching and we're just

374
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:44,159
trying to make sure of course Do no harm

375
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,620
but so far

376
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,419
um you know I'd say about 60 percent of

377
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,799
kids that try CBG seem to have some

378
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:52,019
benefit from it

379
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,099
no and I'm glad you brought up ADHD

380
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,959
because

381
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,000
um I guess full disclosure my son has

382
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,338
been diagnosed with ADHD and when we

383
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,958
first got that I mean of course being in

384
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,540
the industry and everything I I looked

385
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,219
up like oh can cannabis help and most of

386
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,958
the things that I found was like no not

387
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,399
really it's kind of funny that you know

388
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,259
cannabis seems to help with everything

389
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,419
uh that was sort of one of the few

390
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:14,159
things that I saw but when I was doing

391
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:18,000
research and I watched the video about

392
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,679
CBG and you brought that up um I was uh

393
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,299
surprised to see that CBG might be

394
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,120
helpful for that

395
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:30,179
right and again we don't have clinical

396
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:33,659
trials to say yes this is a definitive

397
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:35,879
um benefit for children or detriment we

398
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,379
just don't have the trials yet and I do

399
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,759
think that we are on the cusp of having

400
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:40,259
those trials which would be very

401
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,139
exciting

402
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:45,060
um so again in my practice which is in

403
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:49,019
California

404
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:51,719
um I'm allowed to work with parents to

405
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:54,600
try different cannabinoids right to see

406
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,160
what might help and we do it very

407
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,019
methodically

408
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,000
um you know in my book I talk about rule

409
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,519
it in or rule it out so we start low

410
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,619
dose we titrate up we focus on that one

411
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,519
compound to see what are the benefits

412
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:09,779
and remember too that

413
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,000
sometimes when we're seeing a benefit it

414
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,918
may be because the child's also on CBD

415
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,259
and maybe for them that combination is

416
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,240
working well if you add a compound and

417
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:20,220
see enhanced benefits you don't know if

418
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,439
it's that particular compound or the

419
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,720
combination of the two if they're

420
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,500
already on something so you know it's a

421
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,940
lot of um trial and error unfortunately

422
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,839
it's also

423
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,779
um

424
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,639
again it takes time to sort it out it's

425
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,259
you know I always tell patients when I

426
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,419
first or families when I first meet them

427
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,400
we're going to be working together quite

428
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,200
some time because there is no it's not

429
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,480
like we just pick something and no yep

430
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,160
it works great and see ya that they have

431
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,200
we may get lucky and that happens but

432
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,298
that's not the usual case yeah

433
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,819
absolutely another thing that stood out

434
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:56,000
to me too was this um this idea of CBG

435
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:58,439
kind of enhancing the body's

436
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,460
endocannabinoid function

437
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,320
um I was wondering if you could speak a

438
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,319
bit to that

439
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,839
right so a number of endocannabinoids

440
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:10,759
including CBD and CBG

441
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:12,439
block the breakdown of our

442
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,579
endocannabinoids so remember our

443
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,880
endocannabinoids are our inner cannabis

444
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,199
like compounds our body releases them on

445
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,660
demand

446
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,819
in response to a trigger usually

447
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,100
something that is stressing us whether

448
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,678
it be an illness

449
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:30,959
um you know my famous saying is a bear

450
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,620
chasing you in the woods right

451
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
um

452
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:36,178
um just anything that might stress you

453
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:39,839
inflammation illness some a traumatic

454
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:42,419
insult an infection of some sort your

455
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:45,359
body cranks out these endocannabinoids

456
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,759
in order to help maintain balance of the

457
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,500
messages that the cells are sending so

458
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,599
it's you have to remember the system the

459
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,460
endocannabinoid system is a physiologic

460
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,619
regulator

461
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,940
and it's just helping you stay in

462
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:01,439
Balance anything that promotes

463
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,679
um

464
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,720
the and enhancement of endocannabinoids

465
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,538
in general now sometimes there's there

466
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,640
are some detriments but in general uh

467
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:13,740
especially in someone who's ill that can

468
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,380
be helpful so by enhancing your own

469
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,880
natural endocannabinoid system by

470
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,440
blocking the breakdown of these

471
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,020
endocannabinoids that means they last

472
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,120
longer right it's kind of like you know

473
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:27,298
the way that some antidepressants work

474
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:30,899
is by blocking it helps enhance the way

475
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:35,759
how long serotonin's hanging around okay

476
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:38,100
um and so uh these compounds do this and

477
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,500
um it's very hard to measure

478
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,359
it's very hard to know if it's something

479
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,640
that happens immediately I don't think

480
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,500
so I think it's an overtime what you see

481
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,538
is you may notice and I hear this a lot

482
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,579
from adult patients you know I don't

483
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:52,980
think I need as much cannabis as I'm

484
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:55,619
feeling pretty good I'm not having as

485
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,779
much anxiety I'm sleeping better

486
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,599
and that tells me that maybe cannabis

487
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,379
kind of augmented their natural

488
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,798
endocannabinoid system what we call

489
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,020
upregulated and they're kind of at a

490
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,579
nice sweet spot where they're just a

491
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,500
little more balanced that's the whole

492
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:13,319
concept behind

493
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,058
you know the idea of boosting uh the

494
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,980
endocannabinoid system is to get

495
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:19,500
yourself into better balance

496
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,140
right right and now correct me if I'm

497
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,359
wrong but another way to sort of spurn

498
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,440
your body into creating endocannabinoids

499
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,579
a stressor is um exercise correct

500
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,960
yep

501
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:32,519
so

502
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,440
a little experiment that I've been doing

503
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,319
and I want to get you your opinion on

504
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,558
this is after exercise supplementing

505
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,899
with whether it be CBD CBG would that be

506
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,759
an effective way to sort of you know

507
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,519
keep anandamide in the system and get

508
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,038
sort of the benefits from uh from sort

509
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,960
of our natural cannabinoids

510
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,000
well theoretically

511
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,220
you you could look at it that way I

512
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,740
don't know that it physiologically that

513
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,900
that's exactly what's happening uh

514
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,480
meaning like oh I took a dose and now I

515
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,160
have extra anandamide I don't I don't

516
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,160
think that there's a direct correlation

517
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,980
there but I do think and

518
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,919
you know I think the literature supports

519
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,620
this whole idea of you know cannabinoids

520
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,480
being anti-inflammatory antioxidant

521
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:21,359
neuroprotective

522
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,579
and uh one dose is not going to do the

523
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,379
trick it's usually a regimen that

524
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:28,220
somebody like a wellness regimen if

525
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,419
you're not terribly ill that includes

526
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,159
cannabinoids of course in addition to

527
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:34,080
other healthy things that you should be

528
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,120
doing to enhance your endocannabinoid

529
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,819
system which like you know a healthy

530
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,678
diet good sleep trying to really control

531
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:42,418
your stress which you know is like a

532
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,460
cycle you know use cannabis to control

533
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,380
stress and stress makes it so that maybe

534
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,298
you don't need if your stress is down

535
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,580
you don't need so much cannabis but

536
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:53,279
there's a cycle there that

537
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,319
can be very beneficial

538
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,079
um yeah I mean it's I certainly don't

539
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,000
think that it's

540
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,158
um

541
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,960
if I had to choose to give cannabis

542
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,120
after exercise or not I would say sure

543
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,298
why not it's it certainly could be

544
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:12,719
helpful in recovery

545
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:15,058
all right I'll keep up my regiment time

546
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,038
so you also mentioned so that there is

547
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:19,079
some overlap with CBG and other

548
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,480
cannabinoids and there there's certain

549
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,298
receptors or certain mechanisms that are

550
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,860
are unique to it so I was wondering if

551
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:28,859
you could speak to you know some

552
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:31,019
examples where CBG sort of enhances the

553
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:32,279
effects of other cannabinoids or you

554
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,200
know situations where you think the

555
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,960
combination is useful

556
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,058
right well and in looking at the study

557
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,360
so there's a study in 2019 that showed

558
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:44,579
that the combination of CBD and CBG

559
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:48,479
decreased neural inflammation this is an

560
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:50,759
animal study but they were looking at a

561
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,298
neurodegenerative disorders

562
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:57,658
with dementia what we call Lou Gehrig's

563
00:22:54,298 --> 00:23:00,740
Disease or ALS and it showed in this

564
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:03,120
pre-clinical study that CBD and CBG

565
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,779
worked together and gave better results

566
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,779
for anti-neuroinflammation

567
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,240
and of course remember this goes back to

568
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:15,599
the concept of the Entourage effect

569
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,000
which is when the combinations of

570
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:22,259
cannabinoids and terpenes appear to

571
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,159
enhance the benefits enhance the uh

572
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:27,779
positive results and there's another

573
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,860
study I know I can't remember what year

574
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:34,798
it came out uh recently that showed that

575
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:35,779
CBG in addition to

576
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:40,319
um

577
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:42,720
THC and or CBD was anti-cancer in a

578
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:46,798
model of or in um

579
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,360
test tube study looking at certain brain

580
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,538
tumor cells

581
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:53,399
so in some of my cancer patients you

582
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:56,400
know who come to me with Advanced cancer

583
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,259
very poor prognosis

584
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,798
um I and I've been doing this now for a

585
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,440
number of years I add in CBG to the mix

586
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:07,619
there is to me no harm in doing so it

587
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,140
doesn't cause again the impairment

588
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:13,259
that

589
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:17,759
anti-cancer doses of THC can sometimes

590
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:20,158
um do yeah and so I I was going to ask

591
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,558
you about that so you just mentioned one

592
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,260
but you know what other scenarios or

593
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:28,019
situations uh do you encounter you think

594
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:30,480
you know CBG is either the right tool

595
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:33,298
for the job or might be a good kind of

596
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,919
companion or you know if you're already

597
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:36,119
started a regiment and maybe things

598
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,640
you're not getting the right results

599
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,139
you're you're thinking oh CBG might be

600
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,520
helpful here

601
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,960
right that's a great

602
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,879
that's great because I think that if

603
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,740
you're trying to treat anxiety pain

604
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,280
inflammation

605
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,380
and you are not getting great results

606
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,658
with either

607
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,760
THC or CBD which of course are the most

608
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,700
two most common cannabinoids being used

609
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:02,519
right now certainly the addition of CBG

610
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,140
is worth a try remember too that when

611
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:07,859
you combine cannabinoids sometimes you

612
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:11,460
can get away with a lower dose of either

613
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:14,099
or or both and get that enhanced effect

614
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,140
from that Entourage because there are

615
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:18,719
studies that show that sub-therapeutic

616
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,580
doses meaning doses not expected to do

617
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,720
anything clinically

618
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:25,859
right but when combined will

619
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,900
um

620
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:31,139
uh

621
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:33,480
work better and so I have had patients

622
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,900
who say rather than take let's say 300

623
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,120
milligrams of CBD for my anxiety

624
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,500
which people might like look at that and

625
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,879
say wow that's a really high dose but

626
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,740
when you look at the studies those are

627
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,460
the doses that are being used in studies

628
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,079
to get a true effect right to be able to

629
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,819
find a true effect and remember too

630
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,798
there's some placebo effect of I'm

631
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:55,019
taking CBD and it's supposed to decrease

632
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,819
let's say my pain and anxiety I may have

633
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,558
less pain and anxiety because I'm

634
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:01,918
actively doing something about it and I

635
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:04,918
don't poo poo that I just say you know

636
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,778
for a lot of people high high doses it

637
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,860
just is not Financial financially

638
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:10,740
feasible

639
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:13,859
so sometimes that combination of two

640
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,900
compounds in more sub-therap sub what we

641
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:17,699
consider subtherapeutic doses but in

642
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,679
that combination will work better so

643
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,220
again the the things that I would

644
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,919
recommend CBG for anxiety

645
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:28,079
pain psoriasis

646
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,740
um I use it in my patients with autism I

647
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:36,538
use it in my patients with cancer

648
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:38,940
um and uh certainly I think the future

649
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:41,220
like so this study that came out this

650
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,140
year on multiple sclerosis was that

651
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,298
something now we should be trying in our

652
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,179
patients right and remember that's

653
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:50,158
animal study so we're taking a leap but

654
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,538
again because it's safe if somebody's

655
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,120
struggling

656
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,079
and conventional medicine is not helping

657
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,599
them

658
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:59,038
or it is only helping them to a point I

659
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,058
don't see any reason especially under

660
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,679
medical supervision not to try uh

661
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:07,440
cannabinoids and specifically CBG now

662
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,720
that there's some research to support it

663
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,519
yeah no and that it's a good point to

664
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,380
make it seems like CBG is very well

665
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,960
tolerated by patients but are there

666
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,220
adverse reactions that you typically run

667
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,440
into

668
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,620
so I haven't really seen a lot of

669
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,419
adverse reactions except for a few uh

670
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:26,278
kind of specific ones related to the

671
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:28,740
population of children that I take care

672
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:31,319
of so in some kids with autism it's just

673
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,940
too over stimulating it makes Behavior

674
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,399
go off the charts

675
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,259
and I have seen that numerous times and

676
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,900
so I do warn the families we're going to

677
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,940
get started it may be a dose thing that

678
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,919
lower doses might be over stimulating

679
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,740
and then we try higher doses which

680
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,720
sometimes can be more calming

681
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,919
um and but that's specifically related

682
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,700
to

683
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,278
uh that uh population uh I have not

684
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,700
heard of too many side effects

685
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:01,558
um from people adults taking CBG except

686
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,058
for a few things so I have had some

687
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,418
patients say that it is somewhat

688
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:07,678
alerting meaning it feels a little up so

689
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,600
you would not want to take that right

690
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,519
before bedtime yeah it would just be you

691
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,740
figure out how you respond to it and

692
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,179
then don't use it at night if that's the

693
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,919
effect you get

694
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,840
again on the other hand some people say

695
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,520
it helps with sleep well maybe it's

696
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:24,119
helping with sleep because it's more

697
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,940
calming and decreasing anxiety and again

698
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,918
your response you know when you let's

699
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,240
say 10 people get a similar response and

700
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,740
you're the outlier you say well what's

701
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,200
wrong with me right you just have a

702
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,480
different chemistry we all just have we

703
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,179
I don't get to get like somebody's

704
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,000
underlying chemistry report before I

705
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:43,620
treat them right so it is but nobody

706
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,679
does when a doctor hands you an

707
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:47,939
antidepressant or an opioid nobody knows

708
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,500
how you're going to respond if you've

709
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,720
not taken that before it's the same

710
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,179
thing there's always a little bit of a

711
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,500
risk when you take a new medication that

712
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,179
you may be the person who doesn't

713
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,859
respond very well but on the other hand

714
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,480
you might be the person who gets a great

715
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:03,119
result so

716
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,000
um I do think that um

717
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,979
in that report by uh Dr Russo I think

718
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,019
there were some reports of dry mouth or

719
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,360
some reports of

720
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:14,220
like you know feeling high or whatnot

721
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,918
and again it goes back to what was in

722
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:20,339
the product that they were taking

723
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,320
um you know they did not report on the

724
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:24,178
exact products that patients were using

725
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,178
so it's always a matter of well what

726
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,399
else is in there and also dosing dosing

727
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:32,038
is very very important you can't just

728
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:33,479
take some and think it's going to work

729
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:34,740
you should know what you're doing when

730
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,319
you're dosing it out in terms of

731
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,880
milligrams yeah no that's a good point

732
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:41,099
about the different products too and I

733
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,020
was going to ask you so you know CBG

734
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:45,599
it's one of the Lesser known

735
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:47,519
cannabinoids but are there a fair amount

736
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,398
of products available out there for

737
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:53,778
folks to uh to get

738
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:53,778
that's right in the video

739
00:29:54,898 --> 00:30:00,239
the slide that shows some of the

740
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,880
products you can get it as flour if you

741
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,700
wanted to vaporize it you can get it as

742
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,980
a topical as I've mentioned mostly I've

743
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,600
seen it in tincture form which means you

744
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,339
know an extract in a bottle where you

745
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,719
have a little eye dropper or syringe and

746
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:14,939
you measure out your dose and squirt it

747
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,798
under your tongue you know I don't

748
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,380
endorse any company so I can't Point

749
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,058
anybody in any direction but certainly a

750
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,919
quick Google search I'm sure you can

751
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:25,558
find it and of course always always

752
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,059
always you would before purchasing

753
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,500
anything you want to make sure that you

754
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:31,319
get What's called the certificate of

755
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,819
analysis and you see that what is truly

756
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:36,119
in that bottle

757
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:37,918
uh before you make a purchase and if the

758
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,859
certificate of analysis isn't available

759
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,140
or not readily transparent it is you

760
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:46,019
know move on to the next product

761
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,179
yeah absolutely we actually did a

762
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,839
podcast with a laboratory professional

763
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,640
who was talking about how some

764
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:57,000
manufacturers will even falsify their

765
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,860
coas and there she had some good tips in

766
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,980
there for you know being able to spot

767
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:04,019
the real ones and maybe the the less

768
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,579
scrupulous one so I'll put a link to

769
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:07,259
that one in the show description too

770
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:10,079
because I think that's a good thing for

771
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:11,940
people to know all right so Bonnie

772
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,579
before I let you go first thank you so

773
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,899
much for talking about CBG with us and

774
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:17,939
um look forward to hearing about the

775
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:20,339
other cannabinoids in your talk at can

776
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,259
Med but I also wanted to bring up that

777
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:26,158
you're also going to be leading our

778
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:28,859
medical practicum at can Med 23 along

779
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,620
with Dustin sulak Kevin Spillman and

780
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:33,058
Eloise Thiessen so I was wondering if

781
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:34,918
you could give us a kind of a quick

782
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,619
preview of that of like what people can

783
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,840
expect at the practicum and why do you

784
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,058
believe it's so important to have events

785
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,599
like this to educate clinicians and

786
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:47,759
laypersons about cannabis medicine

787
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,398
well answer the last question first so

788
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:53,339
the the importance is that there for

789
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,979
healthcare professionals there is no

790
00:31:53,339 --> 00:32:00,599
like uh full board training program

791
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,579
there is no residency or internship we

792
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,798
now do have some schools are offering

793
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:07,079
master's degrees and so on but I think

794
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:10,980
hearing from clinicians who are actually

795
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:13,740
practicing this medicine this type of

796
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,120
specialty and working with these

797
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,519
medicines and really learning the

798
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,139
nuances of them is very helpful and

799
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,480
that's the feedback we've gotten in the

800
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,580
past is having a kind of Mentor

801
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,778
clinician educate is

802
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:29,519
really helpful to build on the

803
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:32,278
foundation of what you might be reading

804
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,898
in the literature or in in a book so to

805
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:36,839
speak um

806
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:39,658
and for the practicum you know it's a

807
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,939
full day of education so we start off

808
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:43,380
with you know

809
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,798
endocannabinoid system physiology the

810
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:49,140
physiology of the cannabinoids and the

811
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,538
other phytokustituents of the plant and

812
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,960
um I just want to note uh Dr Spellman

813
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:57,480
Kevin Spelman who's a

814
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,278
brilliant like botanist herbalist years

815
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,640
and years and years of experience and

816
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:04,558
his lecture is amazing on opens your

817
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,840
eyes especially coming from you know my

818
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,460
background which is as an MD in the

819
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:12,599
allopathic world

820
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,759
you know it was a big change for me to

821
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:17,519
um understand Botanical medicine

822
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:20,099
and so having him on board really helps

823
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,179
bridge that gap for those of us who are

824
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:25,619
coming from the allopathic field

825
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,778
um and so

826
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:29,699
we also go through

827
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,558
um you know special consideration well

828
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,360
clinical applications in cannabis and

829
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:35,460
special considerations for geriatric

830
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,859
patients we talk about we have a talk on

831
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,778
the chronic pain treatment I'm talking

832
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:41,639
about Pediatrics and then we have

833
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:43,980
practical panels where we're going to be

834
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,019
giving case reports and you know how to

835
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,940
help your patients pick medicine and I

836
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,640
mean it's just a day chock full of

837
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,679
information for really anybody who wants

838
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,919
to advance their knowledge

839
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:58,740
yeah no it's a fantastic event usually

840
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,778
the highlight of the event and no I

841
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,399
think you're right I think it's it's the

842
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:04,200
collaboration that I think is really

843
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,119
great too because you guys get a lot of

844
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,039
great questions from the clinicians who

845
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,319
are in the audience who are again

846
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,300
sharing some of their experiences and to

847
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,800
see you guys sort of go back and forth

848
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,940
and share that knowledge it's it's

849
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,940
really fascinating

850
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,760
well and it's great to hear about other

851
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,280
people's experiences I always learn

852
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,740
something

853
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,320
from my colleagues from people in the

854
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:34,199
audience from the other speakers it's

855
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,539
just for me it's um

856
