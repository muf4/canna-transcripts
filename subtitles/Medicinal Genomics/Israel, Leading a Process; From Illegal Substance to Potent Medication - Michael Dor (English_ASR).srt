1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:12,609
thank you very much for having me here

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:16,920
for me it's quite moving you've event

3
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:20,140
because exactly 25 years ago I graduated

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,630
here from Kennedy School in my master

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,528
and public administration so to come

6
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:28,689
back after 25 years to this city and to

7
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:33,990
this event thank you very much for the

8
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:37,989
opportunity I used to call my lecture

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:41,079
from illegal substance in the promising

10
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:44,409
medication it's a process that we are

11
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:49,480
only beginning and this fascinating

12
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:53,259
process and we must do it as it was said

13
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:55,839
a minute ago we are not supposed to wait

14
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:58,599
to collect all the proofs and all the

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,750
data we have patients I'm a family

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,299
physician an active one for the last 40

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,730
years tomorrow and flying back and

18
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:09,420
Friday morning I'm going to see patients

19
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,770
again I believe that they good

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,170
administrators in medical services and

21
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:16,719
the center should see patients in Y that

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,750
were given the perspective of the human

23
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:24,700
relationship and on the all things

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:30,599
involved now Israel became kind of

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:36,719
pioneer in this process I think we owe

26
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:42,759
all the change to Professor McCollum was

27
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:47,530
the first one to describe to find THC

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:52,810
and his search guidelines for us at this

29
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:58,299
time we work with him even today in two

30
00:01:52,810 --> 00:02:01,150
occasions that I attended I was told by

31
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,219
other people not Israelis that Professor

32
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,060
Milan ought to have a Nobel Prize for

33
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:07,510
his work but that he will never have I'm

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,899
sure

35
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:14,800
this audience is sympathetic

36
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:17,500
but he will never get it because of this

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,900
is being such a sexy but also

38
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:24,879
problematic issue about the recreational

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:26,860
use I told the story to Professor

40
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,519
McCollum and he laughed very much and

41
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:34,510
said unfortunately those who think so

42
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:39,810
I'm not sitting in Stockholm in the

43
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:45,939
Institute is a half million population

44
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:50,500
during the last ten years we approved

45
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:54,219
almost 30,000 50,000 licenses I'm

46
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,680
speaking about license because Israel is

47
00:02:54,219 --> 00:03:00,129
also obliged by the International

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,010
Convention of narcotics and we cannot

49
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:05,590
allow it to be medication until the

50
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:08,620
International approach will be changed

51
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,920
and I believe that you with your

52
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,039
research and with the change of the

53
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:18,578
attitude of the American states one

54
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,849
after the other analysis should lead

55
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:24,430
this change in the international bodies

56
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:29,680
and then everything will be a lot

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:35,500
quicker at that point in my office

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:38,560
since being the chief medical adviser to

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:42,900
the Minister of Health I signed all

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,569
those licenses once again not a

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,659
prescription but a license to whole to

62
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:54,578
have illegal substance for medical

63
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:58,568
purposes every day on my desk we have

64
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:01,780
between 200 to 300 when we now we have a

65
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:04,268
holiday Passover as you know so I'm

66
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,209
expecting be coming back after the

67
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:09,879
holidays to have about two three

68
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:12,870
thousand requests on my desk of course I

69
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,870
don't do it by myself

70
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:21,259
27,000 are active patients active I mean

71
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:27,050
they took

72
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:30,170
the substance from the dispensary during

73
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:34,009
the last three months we were speaking

74
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:37,310
this morning about the process there is

75
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:41,139
a tremendous pressure from the media and

76
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:46,850
from politicians in Israel I suppose

77
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:52,159
partially it's also here to promote the

78
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:56,920
cannabis usage a for the last two years

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:05:02,030
we have Health Minister rabbi Richman

80
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:05,449
and when he came to the office I asked

81
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:08,899
him please I need to update you for new

82
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:12,949
things in the in the market in a medical

83
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:14,779
field and his first reaction was he

84
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,990
calls me Mickey we work together in

85
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:19,719
previous assignments and we I don't want

86
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,180
to hear a word about it

87
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,790
it took for him to year two weeks in the

88
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,530
office to call me urgently please come

89
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,340
here I want to know everything about it

90
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:33,409
because every news media person every

91
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:35,569
politician doesn't want to speak about

92
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,930
anything else just they ask me about

93
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:42,709
cannabis mostly for members of the

94
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:46,670
families and this is very crucial point

95
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:48,769
we presented our Minister a plan which

96
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:52,280
was later on adapted by the government

97
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:55,839
and since then we are promoting this

98
00:05:52,279 --> 00:06:00,379
area I'll mention it later

99
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:04,669
we are very enthusiastic about research

100
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:07,100
I serve as a member in the Research

101
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,810
Committee which we have the home of the

102
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,060
professor McCollum is the chairman of

103
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:16,699
this committee and during the last year

104
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:19,310
we approved 130 research proposals 30

105
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:22,120
out of them clinical studies that are

106
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,120
now in process

107
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:33,598
I'm not speaking much about it you know

108
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:37,038
this single convention of narcotic drugs

109
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:41,098
the Israeli registration can be

110
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:43,709
something which is different but the

111
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:46,639
governmental decision allowed us to use

112
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:50,249
it according to the Minister of Health

113
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,559
indications instructions rules whatever

114
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:55,289
you want to call it and all of them are

115
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:59,099
published in our web so every physician

116
00:06:55,288 --> 00:07:01,079
and every patient can look and say look

117
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:04,769
how beautiful the message section I'm

118
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,989
entitled to cannabis in the enjoy it we

119
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:10,978
have a problem with old-fashioned

120
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:15,718
physicians as you say thick and thick

121
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:18,478
old dog new tricks that is the verb it's

122
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:21,329
difficult I'm going from I go from one

123
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:26,488
meeting to another for in hospitals

124
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:29,908
Ejim O's weekends my my wife likes it

125
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:35,698
very much we spend the weekend I give a

126
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:38,368
lecture and trying to teach but nothing

127
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,769
is mentioned in medical schools and that

128
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:47,039
is part of the problem another problem

129
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:50,069
is this mix-up of issues like we talked

130
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:53,699
this morning there is this recreational

131
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:58,679
issue there is the medical I'm a medical

132
00:07:53,699 --> 00:08:02,069
site only each time I open the

133
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:03,778
Parliament being the representative the

134
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:06,299
sending representative of the Minister

135
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:09,629
of Health the politician asked me what

136
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:12,328
about recreational use and my answer is

137
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:16,158
always look I'm a physician I'm in

138
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:19,168
charge of this medical part the

139
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:23,658
recreational use is a social decision

140
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:24,959
that should be done by politicians

141
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:27,149
elections

142
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:31,110
whatever you say not by me not by

143
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:33,000
physicians but when they press me well

144
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,428
you cannot sit here as a senior

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,860
presentative of the ministry not even an

146
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:39,429
open

147
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:43,810
in then I say okay it will have its

148
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:46,088
costs like an alcohol like nicotine this

149
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:51,189
also decision was that you can sell

150
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:55,180
nickels to every person over 18 okay you

151
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:59,200
have the results cannabis is a lot

152
00:08:55,179 --> 00:09:06,849
better than alcohol but it has its own

153
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:09,040
price as well just few numbers the

154
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,889
evolution of the numbers numbers of

155
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,679
requests that during the last trees I'm

156
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:18,278
in my office for the last four years

157
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:24,870
it was increased from 32,000 to almost

158
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:28,419
55 licenses as I mentioned almost 28,000

159
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:32,620
average amount and this is very tricky

160
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:36,338
figure because I'm never sure exactly

161
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,828
when we approve 20 grams what is the

162
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:42,070
percentage of THC or CBD in those grams

163
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:44,679
so this is quite a tricky number in our

164
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:49,540
instructions for the next year it will

165
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:53,409
be mentioned very specifically hey

166
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:58,049
during the last year at least legally we

167
00:09:53,409 --> 00:10:02,828
dispense almost one tonne of cannabis

168
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:07,599
928 kilos the average amount for

169
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:10,419
patients is 33 grams I have some

170
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,028
heritage from my friends that were

171
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:16,769
running this subject before with people

172
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:21,730
getting up to 200 grams a month

173
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:26,789
personally I'm very I have doubts about

174
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:31,079
the person using such amount alone

175
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:31,078
they usually have help

176
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:39,519
the evolution of cannabis as I mentioned

177
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:47,050
more patients smaller doses it is not

178
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:48,699
worth waste of administration well one

179
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:55,169
of the pictures disappeared

180
00:10:48,700 --> 00:11:02,140
most probably illegal picture inhalation

181
00:10:55,169 --> 00:11:06,209
sublingual and oral we do not we didn't

182
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:10,689
allow until now skin preparations and

183
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,879
were very afraid of cookies our general

184
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,950
director of the ministry was very

185
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,029
concerned about the problem that the

186
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:24,550
grandchildren eat grandma's cookies

187
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:28,990
which could be bed I want to mention

188
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:32,139
that if you think what what how do you

189
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,720
want to be taken but there is a

190
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:37,689
development now of an Israeli start

191
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,440
start up I will not change the name and

192
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:45,430
I don't have any part in this company

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:49,440
unfortunately they prepare inhalers you

194
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:53,409
all know this inventor in all those

195
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,220
asthma treatments they have this inhaler

196
00:11:53,409 --> 00:12:00,789
with small heating device I suppose most

197
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:04,050
of you know that in order to reactivate

198
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:08,379
the substance you need to heat it to 184

199
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:11,500
Celsius degrees so they built a small

200
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:14,620
device which makes the heating and then

201
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:20,080
he can inhale exact amount very

202
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:23,769
efficient and I hope that in next few

203
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:27,310
years we will stop this smoking issue

204
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:30,669
which is a physician I don't like it and

205
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:38,479
give it in inhalation or many in other

206
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:42,269
ways how to get cannabis

207
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,539
we have a very structured process every

208
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:51,679
specialist in the country can recommend

209
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:56,299
a cannabis within his own specialization

210
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:58,829
oncologist pain control physician

211
00:12:56,299 --> 00:13:05,539
neurologist pediatric neurologist

212
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:08,940
psychiatrist he needs to fill form

213
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:12,149
computerized form and said sent it to

214
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:16,350
our office with the whole medical

215
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:19,039
history of the patient why I insist on

216
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,320
the medical history because many times

217
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,399
the prescribing physician is very

218
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,700
distinguished specialist and he knows

219
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,909
everything about Neurology he knows

220
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,460
nothing about the sacked psychiatry

221
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:36,209
condition of the patient or his lung

222
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,710
situation so for that purpose I insist

223
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,889
on having the whole history of the

224
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:47,850
patient which we can check and approve

225
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:52,429
approve the usage in case of psychotic

226
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:55,769
history when I come to the main

227
00:13:52,429 --> 00:14:01,109
contraindication today severe

228
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:06,360
psychiatric problems history of

229
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:08,730
addiction are in our opinion a relative

230
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,909
contraindication weiss a relative

231
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,610
because some psychiatrist can say okay

232
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:17,189
he was one see as the problem and now

233
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,129
he's okay we can give him cannabis if

234
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,830
he's in unstable condition maybe not at

235
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:25,919
that time

236
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:29,730
we have difference of opinion dr.

237
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:32,610
Resnick who is he'll is he believed that

238
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:35,730
it's almost not existent very small

239
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,550
numbers had the same more but some say

240
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:41,370
between one to ten percent of people of

241
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:45,349
patients with pre-existing psychiatric

242
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:48,590
conditions they tend

243
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:53,570
to be hospital not hospitalized but the

244
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:56,570
new treatment so this is today the most

245
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,670
significant contraindication to medical

246
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,700
treatment of cannabis and I believe that

247
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:04,909
infused and we'll know more about the

248
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:07,940
subtypes I mean about maybe some types

249
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:11,889
of THC will be consistent with this

250
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,890
situation but I don't know it

251
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,480
I have 15 physicians working for me they

252
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:25,240
see all the applications and after the

253
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:29,060
approve it it is it comes to my

254
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,919
signature unfortunately I'm the only one

255
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:33,949
allowed to sign it because all other

256
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:36,679
physician refused why because there was

257
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:41,530
a tremendous pressure intimidation for

258
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:45,319
them you must approve it otherwise so I

259
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:47,870
got all the pressure on me and my wife

260
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,780
not deny all the phone calls the nasty

261
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:53,810
phone calls telling her what they think

262
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:58,970
and Mary about my mother which is not

263
00:15:53,809 --> 00:16:03,529
true I promise to you but but we

264
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,790
survived the license after a son is

265
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,009
transferred to one of the eight

266
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:10,879
companies today we have eight companies

267
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:14,179
distributing cannabis to the patients at

268
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:18,590
the beginning of treatment day each one

269
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:21,469
needs to have teaching one hour teaching

270
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:26,830
how to use it we found that in many

271
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:29,810
cases people didn't use it correctly and

272
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:35,300
at that point they didn't enjoy the

273
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:39,469
treatment after being after they learn

274
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:46,849
how to use it the percentage of success

275
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:50,509
is very very high since it is a license

276
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:55,009
and since we want them to be followed by

277
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:58,629
their physician we ask to renew the

278
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:58,629
license I mean to renew the

279
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:05,629
request for a continuation of treatment

280
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:09,410
every year sometimes every six months in

281
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:11,570
special cases this is basically medical

282
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:15,350
decision what is the interval between

283
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:19,879
the follow-up meetings increase of

284
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:24,049
dosage during the most of the patient

285
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,900
ask for higher doses of cannabis we

286
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:32,480
decided that it will be done gradually I

287
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:36,259
saw one of the presenters yesterday they

288
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,110
said start row and increase row

289
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,859
something like that and yes this is what

290
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:44,569
we believe

291
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:45,799
I wanted the follow-up responsibility to

292
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:48,490
be transferred to primary care

293
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:51,319
physicians family physicians like me

294
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:54,230
they are afraid they are afraid because

295
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:57,579
in those places when it was started a

296
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:01,490
lot of people came to us for cannabis

297
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:05,869
when the physician didn't think it was

298
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:08,380
appropriate the moment you have two

299
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:11,449
markets one medical market one

300
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,590
recreational market of course this kind

301
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:20,259
of leakage and kind of influence I

302
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:22,849
mentioned 28,000 patients being treated

303
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:26,059
according to our estimations we have 1

304
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:28,459
million people who use cannabis for

305
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:32,059
recreational use once a week once a

306
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,720
month even the party whatever and our

307
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:40,220
medical cannabis has a reputation of

308
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,920
being a good one so they try to bite and

309
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,130
for some patients it's quite the

310
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:54,410
temptation to sell part of the part of

311
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:57,560
the staff indication we have an

312
00:18:54,410 --> 00:19:01,370
indication committee which I gather once

313
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:03,649
once a month every two months each time

314
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:06,500
I ask the physician to prepare homework

315
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,750
the best physician in this field they

316
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,160
prepare the homework and suggestion for

317
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,279
decision

318
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:17,810
we'd discuss it and then if it is

319
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:23,200
approved it appears in our web as an

320
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:23,200
indication as an approved education

321
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:30,319
sometimes people ask for comedies for

322
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:34,790
cannabis when they do not fit the

323
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:37,359
indication so it's not entirely my

324
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:41,149
decision I have a build committee and

325
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:44,209
all those cases that fall between the

326
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:48,710
chairs we discuss them the last meeting

327
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:51,500
we had 60 requests and 54 out of them

328
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:54,440
were approved so we really try to be

329
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:59,299
open to things that we know don't know

330
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:02,390
much enough about this expert committee

331
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:08,269
evaluates the nude indication and the

332
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:10,370
old one in one case only glaucoma the

333
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:14,029
American ophthalmology Association

334
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:15,829
decided that it is not useful in

335
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:19,629
glaucoma it does not reduce the

336
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:22,730
intraocular pressure and they stopped

337
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:26,180
cancer the indication we followed them

338
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:31,420
and this is the only case I remember

339
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:36,289
that we abolished stopped existing

340
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:39,620
indication oncology 40% of our patients

341
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:41,990
are oncology patients I don't have to

342
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:45,049
mention many things you know it helps

343
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:48,559
them to stop vomiting usually you can

344
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:51,740
stop the opiates and they they don't

345
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,769
have constipation anymore they can eat

346
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,980
they can sleep and they look better and

347
00:20:53,769 --> 00:21:00,529
I find myself in the parliament asking

348
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:04,250
an answering question why don't you

349
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:07,039
allow cannabis for treatment of cancer

350
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:10,250
to all the patients and it is not that

351
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:14,299
simple to explain the Parliament members

352
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:17,329
the difference between a treating

353
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:20,629
cannabis letting the cancer and treating

354
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:23,298
symptoms and I really hope the next few

355
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,460
years will find what types of cancer

356
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:26,298
how can we help them with cannabis for

357
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,909
the time being

358
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:34,158
it's symptomatic treatment only primary

359
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:37,340
and secondary metastatic pain of course

360
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,399
end-of-life we do try to be as quick as

361
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:42,168
as helpful as possible then it's quite a

362
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:44,808
problem with this continuation of

363
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:48,110
treatment for example if I have a lady

364
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:52,940
after mastectomy she was given cannabis

365
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:56,089
with oncology person a patient and after

366
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,369
5 years she is perfectly okay as a

367
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:02,449
physician I believe she is completely

368
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:05,298
cured but to stop the cannabis it is a

369
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:09,440
problem not that much about habit

370
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:11,960
formation but kind of dependence I don't

371
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,859
know how to call it but it is quite a

372
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,308
problem and believe me it's no good to

373
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:24,128
argue with oncology patient especially

374
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:24,128
if all the media focused on your face

375
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:31,849
palliative treatment about 30 percent

376
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:35,538
are for treatment which was interact for

377
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:39,969
intractable pain our inception we demand

378
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:42,739
that the patient will be given all day

379
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:46,308
known medication not all of them but

380
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:49,429
some of them and only if you fail with

381
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:51,489
the regular then-known the proof

382
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:54,230
treatment then you start cannabis I

383
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:57,350
really believe that in a few months or a

384
00:22:54,230 --> 00:23:00,950
year we will change this rule and

385
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:04,908
cannabis will become a first-line choice

386
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:08,929
for treatment not after exhausting all

387
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:14,330
other possibilities well the market is

388
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:16,820
full of promises full you have

389
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:19,460
advertising to telling people that

390
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:24,798
cannabis will cure every disease you

391
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:27,308
have my friends used to say they even it

392
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:31,480
will bring you back your last love

393
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:35,450
I'm not sure this is a proper indication

394
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,160
neurology multiple sclerosis Parkinson's

395
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:41,090
patients suffering

396
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:44,570
chronic pain caused by a rigidity to

397
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:48,619
read Tourette syndrome unbelievable

398
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:49,339
successful the treatment is unbelievable

399
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:56,469
success

400
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:56,470
I mentioned the problems of psychosis

401
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,839
epilepsy were proved for adults lately

402
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:05,750
Neurology it was mentioned yesterday and

403
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:09,259
I was very impressed we have the same

404
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:12,470
results with epileptic children autistic

405
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:15,259
spectrum they have any problem how to

406
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:19,220
define this spectrum which is very very

407
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:22,059
wide and very undefined we have now more

408
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:25,490
than 250 children treated for

409
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:30,289
intractable epilepsy a few months ago

410
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:34,039
ask the specialist to present results

411
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:36,639
intermediate results more than 50% of

412
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,349
the children were well if not

413
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,780
conventions free so less than 5

414
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:45,589
convulsions a day I mean those kids that

415
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:48,319
started with 2 300 convergence a day 30

416
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:52,549
percent the number of conversions went

417
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:54,950
down to less than 20 and about 10 to 20

418
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:57,470
percent didn't enjoy the treatment

419
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,210
well I'm physician if someone will tell

420
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,490
me that you have a treatment there's

421
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:05,440
good 400 percent of patients I won't

422
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:08,870
believe it neurology ALS Lou Gehrig's

423
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:13,029
disease fibromyalgia which is quite a

424
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:15,409
problem because the disease is not

425
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:18,379
defined enough we all don't have the

426
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:21,920
buret all says no other the stroke from

427
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:24,820
sores I'm running last anthology with

428
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:29,360
relative colitis very good results

429
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:33,289
psychiatry we have more than 1500 people

430
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:39,579
most of them victims of war soldiers

431
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:45,148
treated for PTSD following unsuccessful

432
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:48,239
psychological other treatments they

433
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:50,428
they enjoy it very much almost all of

434
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:53,338
them continue the treatment I mentioned

435
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:58,169
ophthalmology we have a problem with

436
00:25:53,338 --> 00:26:00,928
pain clinics that are overcrowded I

437
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:04,409
mentioned our health minister Richmond

438
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:07,798
which he was the one to present it to

439
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:11,849
the government in that its approval just

440
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:13,588
shortly the numbers of our patients 8000

441
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:16,319
of them are treated for illogical

442
00:26:13,588 --> 00:26:20,509
problems directly in the hospitals the

443
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:25,128
rest as you see oncology Crohn's disease

444
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:28,108
neuropathic pain HIV this is kind of

445
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:32,459
symptomatic treatment for very difficult

446
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:36,689
cases and PTSD I mentioned controversial

447
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:39,749
issues which we have problem with the

448
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,179
driving under influence of cannabis we

449
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:45,419
don't have enough data to make decisions

450
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:49,460
I hope maybe you were but I didn't see

451
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:49,460
it price of treatment

452
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:59,158
you don't recognize them I was asked by

453
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:02,159
the hospitals what to do about treating

454
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,349
patients with cannabis inside hospitals

455
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,989
because the physician some of them do

456
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:10,259
not like the rule I made is that only

457
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:12,119
with the approval of 13 of the physician

458
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:16,469
the department he can use the cannabis

459
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:21,418
they have the problem of smoke alarms in

460
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:24,058
the a export I believe that we will come

461
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:26,849
to that when will make a medication out

462
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:31,979
of it we wanted very much to start

463
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:35,968
export but our foreign ministry ministry

464
00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:38,098
was very much opposed against it because

465
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:40,200
they were afraid Israel will be

466
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:43,829
portrayed all over the world as a

467
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:48,538
country exporting weapons and cannabis

468
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:51,689
it is not good for our image so if I

469
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:58,558
finish we are going from substance to me

470
00:27:51,690 --> 00:28:02,009
to medicine startup and that's one

471
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:05,450
short story about older patient and she

472
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:09,240
was given cannabis for Debbie's were not

473
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:11,639
quite understood diagnosis so after

474
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,609
months people called her our people

475
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:18,658
called asking grandma does it help you

476
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:21,479
and her answer was look for the diseases

477
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:24,200
I don't know but my grandchildren are

478
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,349
coming to visit

479
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,350
thank you

480
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,809
you
