00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,060
I mean one thing that can mat does so

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,189
well is it demonstrates that this field

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,920
is exciting there's a ton of research on

9
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:39,570
different aspects of the field it's it's

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,219
well funded and there's a lot of

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,170
scientific interest and that this is

12
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,019
real this isn't this isn't just

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,270
anecdotal data this this is real

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,670
scientific evidence and a lot of valid

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,530
interest rule relax everything's real

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,079
open it's really easy to get out and

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,120
speak to one-on-ones i I've already seen

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,589
more cannabis science here and I've been

19
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,058
in kind of a science for six years I've

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,180
seen more too concentrated here than

21
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:06,689
anywhere else for this is late first

22
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,950
hand med and I actually I'm so impressed

23
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,219
I haven't been asleep for three days

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,670
because all the information stimulating

25
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:16,260
I love this conferences which my second

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,600
hair here and it's always full of

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,520
information and it's really important to

28
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,319
their dissipate in this my friend we

29
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,879
have to be many minds involved to solve

30
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,649
really complicated problems if you have

31
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,269
to take a very distributed approach that

32
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,219
you push innovation to the edge of

33
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,969
networks and allow for the spider

34
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,969
permissionless innovation

35
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,670
you
