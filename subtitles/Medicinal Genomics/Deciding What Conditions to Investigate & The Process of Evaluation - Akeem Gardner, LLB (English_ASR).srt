you do use AI environment informaticians

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,480
to help screen our molecules and give uh

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,240
um us information for where we think

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
this might be most applic one um one of

6
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,598
the things that we know that our

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,480
ingredients do very well is they target

8
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,879
the inflammatory related properties and

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,799
we know that chronic inflammation

10
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,920
um systematic chronic inflammation is

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,839
related to a wide variety of diseases

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,800
usually everything starts as that slow

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,359
burning continuous inflammation goes

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,159
undetected then it can turn into cancer

15
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,238
into neurod degenerative problems into

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,799
cardiovascular problems so on and so

17
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:52,519
forth so where we start is we look at

18
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,280
okay um what areas of disease or what

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,920
other indications are related to a

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,000
inflammation um even if inflammation is

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,239
the primary um driver of that disease do

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,400
our molecules hit other targets that are

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,960
related to that disease for example in

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,759
our cancer program fora we found out our

25
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,039
molecules also hit Tre be so that we

26
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,599
were able to go down that pathway but

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,960
then really what I try to do is I

28
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,359
thought try to find a key opinion leader

29
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,438
someone who's used to doing the academic

30
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:24,759
or pre-clinical or Discovery work

31
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,239
required to be able to validate the

32
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,239
ideas the hypothesises that we have so

33
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,319
in Canada we are very forunate to have a

34
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,519
wide variety of um

35
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,639
universities um with a lot of

36
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,599
investigators with the government

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,000
programs that can fund um student

38
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,919
research so that professors with the

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,519
oversight can lead a PhD or a master

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,478
student or even sometimes undergrad

41
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,000
student students to do a series of

42
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,319
experiments for us proof of concept

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,118
experiments for us that will give us the

44
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,839
information we need to deductively

45
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,879
reason and say yes this is what we want

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,118
want to do or this is where we think we

47
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,959
have the highest chance of success or we

48
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:08,360
can turn this around in a reasonable

49
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,919
time because from this batch of

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,080
experiments and work previously done we

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,079
can FastTrack this into the clinic which

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,280
we're trying to do with our first asset

53
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,280
our lead asset for M neuron disease
