1
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,349
I'm gonna focus on mostly synthetic

2
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:12,919
chemistry and finish up with a little

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:17,149
bit of biological activity in mice not

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:20,089
men ok so I'm here to tell you today

5
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:23,898
about a new cannabinoid that we've

6
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:26,210
discovered hexa hydro cannabinoid acid

7
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:29,960
or can have aknowledge acid which you

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:34,250
get from hydrogenation of tea HCA which

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,649
is the form of THC that's expressed in

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,990
the trichome so when this compound is

11
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:41,810
hydrogenated it makes hexahydrate

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,130
cannabinoid acid and that's what we're

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,590
going to talk about today is the

14
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:51,680
hydrogenation of cannabinoids which

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,990
turns the tetrahydrocannabinol that

16
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,399
we're very familiar with into hexa hydro

17
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,560
cannabinoids because we're adding a

18
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,060
molecule of hydrogen to the North double

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,890
bond of the ring when we do this on

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,780
cannabis extracts that contain terpenes

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,659
terpenoids and flavonoids those

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,950
compounds have double bonds too just to

23
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,080
get a little chemical on you what a

24
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,140
double bond is is that's two carbons

25
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,700
that are doubly bonded to each other and

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,939
when you react that with hydrogen it

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,680
saturates the double bond so in all of

28
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:24,079
these compounds terpenes and terpenoids

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,180
and flavonoids that are present in the

30
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,489
cannabis plant there are multiple double

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:32,000
bonds and so when we hydrogenate an

32
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:33,679
extract that's enriched with THC a or

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,390
CBD a if we're using that type of

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,450
variety

35
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:41,000
we also hydrogenate the the other

36
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,430
compounds there and what we'd like to do

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,959
is exploit what we call the ensembl

38
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,890
effect which we prefer over the

39
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,298
entourage effect of the multiple

40
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,760
compounds that are provided in the

41
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:56,650
cannabis plant that provides biological

42
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,030
activities so we do know that there is a

43
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,520
synergistic effect of these compounds

44
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:04,579
and what we'd like to do is explore

45
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,969
hydrogenation has a very simple scalable

46
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:10,310
widely practiced reaction to be able to

47
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:12,378
chemically transform the oil that we get

48
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,329
from extraction of the cannabis plant to

49
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:17,679
improve efficacy stability in the

50
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:17,680
pharmacokinetic profile

51
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:24,509
so where did this idea come from I

52
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,189
worked at DuPont central research for

53
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:29,489
about eighteen and a half years and one

54
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:31,919
of the projects I worked on was the

55
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,560
hydrogenation of cat monoi oil so cat

56
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,769
meant very similar to cannabis expresses

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,890
its oil and glandular trichomes on the

58
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,570
surface of the leaves it's enriched with

59
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:44,669
a monoterpene oide that we call in the

60
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,639
pate a lactone on the pate a lactone is

61
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,229
actually what's responsible for the

62
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,269
excitation in cats and by the way it

63
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:52,979
goes clear up the feline kingdom it's

64
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,100
not just your little domestic friend at

65
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:59,189
home but big cats when they're exposed

66
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:03,449
to cat mint want to listen to jazz and

67
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:06,120
eat Twinkies it's an interesting notion

68
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:09,869
too because these irid oh I'm sorry

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,810
go back these ear annoyed Munno terpenes

70
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,150
which paid a lactone are also found in

71
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,099
the secretion of insects so what we

72
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,230
found is that when we take cat monoi oil

73
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,879
which we harvest this is a field in the

74
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:23,519
punjab region of india where we were

75
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,519
developing a supply chain of cat monoi

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,140
oil here's some local workers who are

77
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,909
distilling the cat monoi oil and a steam

78
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,879
distillation we take the steam distill

79
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,829
cat monoi oil and we hydrogenate it and

80
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,409
when we hydrogenate it we take this

81
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,540
material now the hydrogenated Caplin oil

82
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,299
and here's some references that describe

83
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:45,139
the efficacy against biting takes we

84
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,480
have really good efficacy against the

85
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:53,119
mosquito that carries both West Nile

86
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,959
virus and the Zika virus as well so

87
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,640
hydrogenated cap monoi oil is a

88
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,310
registered insect repellent with the EPA

89
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,229
EPA regulates insect repellents because

90
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:09,090
it falls into the bucket of insecticides

91
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:11,129
and DuPont did not commercialize this

92
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,840
but they've licensed this to a company

93
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,329
called antumul and anthem all is

94
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,579
basically looking to develop a supply

95
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,400
chain both here in the West as well as

96
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,168
over in Asia of cat monoi oil you don't

97
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,000
just snap your fingers and have 80

98
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:27,209
million pounds of cat monoi oil you have

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,360
to basically build up the agronomy to be

100
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:32,609
able to deliver that but look for this

101
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,430
material to be launched in the next year

102
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,949
or two and to replace DEET as the

103
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,310
preferred insect repellent so that's

104
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:45,680
sort of like where this idea came from

105
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:49,939
in the hydrogenation of cat monoi oil is

106
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,410
carry Offaly which is a very ubiquitous

107
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,779
sesquiterpene oeid that's also found in

108
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,580
the extract of cannabis and so what we

109
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,529
found when we hydrogenate cat monoi oil

110
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,629
is we hydrogenate this terpene and we

111
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:03,509
were able to actually observe all four

112
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:06,060
of these diastereomers and NMR and we

113
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:11,759
grabbed a US patent on it too as well

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:14,728
and so I became known as the hydrogenate

115
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,930
er give me something and and I

116
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:17,728
hydrogenate it well

117
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,129
another thing we hydrogenated we take

118
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:22,529
the essential amino acid lysine and

119
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:24,478
notice there's no double bond and lysine

120
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:26,519
but what we have is a carboxylic acid

121
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,949
here and by changing our catalyst

122
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,529
conditions in the hydrogenation we could

123
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:34,560
reduce a carboxylic acid so we think

124
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:36,000
again by changing the conditions we can

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,250
now do different chemistry to

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,399
cannabinoid acids to reduce their acids

127
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:44,509
as it turns out we can take this diamine

128
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,739
which we call lyse and all and replace

129
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:49,469
petrochemical derived I amines that are

130
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,629
about three times more expensive in the

131
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,220
billion-dollar market of epoxy resins

132
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:55,430
worldwide this is currently being

133
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:00,150
commercialized

134
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:02,389
so yeah the hydrogenate ER when the only

135
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:05,759
tool you have is a hammer everything

136
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,860
looks like a nail so give me a

137
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,279
biological feedstock and I'm the

138
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,020
hydrogenate ER I'm gonna hydrogenate it

139
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:17,779
so that let's talk about hydrogenated

140
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:19,879
cannabis oil so this is my chemical

141
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,409
great-great-grandfather so my PhD

142
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:26,069
advisors advisor advisor I think that's

143
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:30,830
right chemical genealogy this is uh late

144
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:36,839
roger adams and you have to think that

145
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:40,228
again in 1940 these papers came out in

146
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,478
about 1942 41 look how close his

147
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:43,848
structure to THC was 20 years before

148
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,418
Michonne discovered it

149
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:49,278
you'll see that his structure of THC is

150
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:51,109
totally correct except for the placement

151
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:53,149
of the double bond which we know is

152
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,389
between these two carbons not between

153
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:59,538
these two distal carbons so Rafael Mushu

154
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:02,449
l'm in 1964 had the luxury of 60

155
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:05,149
megahertz NMR to be able to identify

156
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,399
where that double bond was but really

157
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:10,189
Rafi stands on the shoulders of Roger

158
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,709
Adams here because Roger Adams came up

159
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:16,309
with the structures of the cannabinoids

160
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:17,990
including the structure of CBD again

161
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:22,279
with the double bond in the wrong place

162
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:25,098
and here is the structure of the fully

163
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:28,658
hydrogenated material but notice it's

164
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:31,788
not the hydrogenated THC acid it's just

165
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:37,428
hydrogenated THC which we call hexa

166
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:41,300
hydro can have it all so the machine

167
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:43,968
group did look at hydrogenation and in

168
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,788
ninety or I'm sorry in 2006 reported

169
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:49,069
these hydrogenated derivatives of CBD

170
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:52,188
so it wasn't CBD acid it was CBD and

171
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:54,649
they hydrogenated CBD to make in this

172
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:56,689
case eight CBD what you see here is that

173
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:59,509
there's two sets of double bonds in CBD

174
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:02,718
and so you have this EXO cyclic

175
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:04,479
methylene and the cyclohexene and they

176
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:07,550
actually develop conditions to

177
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,838
selectively hydrogenate one olefin over

178
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,449
the other which is a nice little piece

179
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:15,728
of synthetic chemistry and they found

180
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,728
that these compounds again like CBD

181
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:22,848
controlled inflammation and other

182
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:25,490
anti-inflammatory activity so people had

183
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:29,748
looked at these hexa hydro cannabinoids

184
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:32,629
as potentially therapeutic targets the

185
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:34,579
Kim group later on looked at hexa hydro

186
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:37,490
cannabinol again not the cannabinol

187
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:39,620
acids but hexahydrate cannabinol notice

188
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,149
how this has got a wedge coming up and

189
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,068
that's got a hash going into the board

190
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:44,448
these are the diastereomers that you

191
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:47,028
make when you hydrogenate

192
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:48,078
THC you get a little bit of the methyl

193
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,269
up and you get a little bit of the

194
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:52,698
methyl down these can be separated by

195
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,799
comma tog Rafi and this group showed

196
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:57,229
that they were potent anti-cancer agents

197
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,719
and looked at models too

198
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,930
that we're looking at angiogenesis which

199
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,070
is the tumors ability to reroute

200
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:06,559
vascular plumbing to feed it with a

201
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,850
fresh blood supply so it looked like

202
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,769
this was going to be an area of

203
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,220
interesting interesting biological

204
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:14,799
activity so our concept was to basically

205
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,680
oh I'm sorry

206
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:22,339
go back our concept was to basically

207
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:24,019
take whole plant extract and not purify

208
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,240
the compounds but then do a direct

209
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:28,389
hydrogenation to make what we call 8co

210
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,350
or hydrogenated cannabis oil

211
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:33,679
alternatively we can take the whole

212
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:37,550
plant extract decarboxylate it to now

213
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:41,599
remove the co2 then do a hydrogenation

214
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:43,669
to make decarboxylated HCL and notion is

215
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,560
is that we're going to transform what

216
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:47,719
Mother Nature has already provided by

217
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,389
doing the heavy lifting providing these

218
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,910
wonderful compounds in the plant to do a

219
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:54,919
chemical modification of those compounds

220
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:58,629
to create hopefully something that has

221
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:01,159
improved properties so here is a

222
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:03,669
representation of a bunch of structures

223
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:09,230
that are found in the cannabis plant

224
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:13,399
most notably Delta 9 THC a delta 9 CBD a

225
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,409
and a host of variety of terpenes that I

226
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,850
point out here this is certainly not an

227
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:19,429
exclusive list there's many many

228
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,009
compounds in cannabis so when we take

229
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:24,229
this mixture and all of these things

230
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:26,750
where you see two lines between carbons

231
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:30,710
these are called double bonds and so

232
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:34,190
when we hydrogenate these it turns into

233
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:37,009
this so we've completely saturated all

234
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:40,840
of those double bonds and we've turned

235
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:43,340
the tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid into

236
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,560
hexahydrate cannabinol ik acid so it's

237
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,960
still a cannabinoid it's just a

238
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,549
cannabinoid that no longer has the

239
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,160
double bond here and it's important to

240
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:57,799
point out that with the carboxylic acid

241
00:10:52,159 --> 00:11:00,230
here when I did a search and sciFinder

242
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,089
this is this is a thrilling thing for a

243
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,690
synthetic chemist like myself to do a

244
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:10,879
search on sciFinder and to find zero

245
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:15,600
hits in chemical abstract on this

246
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:18,750
which is a hydrogenation away from THC a

247
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,070
which is the star of the show so

248
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:25,529
realizing that this is a novel

249
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:28,500
composition of matter we had to file a

250
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:30,029
patent on it so our friends in the

251
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,950
pharmaceutical industry don't try to

252
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,829
scoot me anyone ever look at a billion

253
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,900
dollar molecule before come up and look

254
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,310
at it if you want to look at it it's a

255
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:42,689
little white crystals on the bottom of a

256
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:45,629
flask so hexahydrate can a banal ik acid

257
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,840
new composition of matter cool I think I

258
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:49,679
stumbled into something pretty valuable

259
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,450
okay so let's talk about the

260
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,299
hydrogenation of cannabis so what we do

261
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:57,210
is this is called a partial and all this

262
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:59,339
is is basically a vessel here that we

263
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,889
can put under a pressure of hydrogen and

264
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,080
shake it because we have a catalyst in

265
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,210
there and to get the catalyst mixing

266
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,710
with the elements in the reaction we

267
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:12,450
have to shake it so we use this thing

268
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:15,060
called a par shaker and what we see this

269
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,310
is called thin layer chromatography and

270
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:19,709
what happens is we spot the reactions

271
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,419
down here and then we elute with a

272
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,180
solvent in this direction and what we

273
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,949
find is that the starting material

274
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:27,989
doesn't run quite as fast as the

275
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:30,570
hydrogenated product this gives us an

276
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,700
indication that our reaction is complete

277
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,160
because here we have a mixture of both

278
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,900
the starting material and the product

279
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,549
here we have just the starting material

280
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,230
here's the product and we see no

281
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,839
starting material presence so we know

282
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:46,920
that our reactions complete and we could

283
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,009
isolate our product we run a lot of

284
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:52,740
what's called nuclear magnetic resonance

285
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:57,000
proton NMR proton NMR of this stuff is

286
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:59,850
amazingly clean amazingly clean I sound

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,019
like Donald Trump then I it's beautiful

288
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,759
great you're gonna love it okay so

289
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,399
here's the carbon three here's the

290
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,740
carbon 13 NMR which again is you know I

291
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,539
don't know the non synthetic chemists

292
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,049
may not be able to appreciate but this

293
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:18,389
is extremely extremely clean product

294
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:20,219
okay so here's what the material looks

295
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,710
like it's a white crystalline solid as a

296
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,750
sharp melting point between 60 and 63

297
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,910
degrees

298
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,580
here's we've made a bunch of the

299
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:32,759
material and I'm happy to report that

300
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:36,300
I've consumed this material and to tell

301
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:39,059
you that it gives me a psychological

302
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:42,419
effect similar to consuming a THC type

303
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:45,809
material I could feel at a very high dab

304
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:50,279
dose kind of like ringing in my limbs

305
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:52,979
and my beard feels crispy which is

306
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:59,309
interesting never felt the crispy beard

307
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:02,250
but okay again very very pure compound

308
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:04,619
I'm gonna skip through this okay we

309
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,690
identify things by its molecular weight

310
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,370
so the molecular weight is a unique

311
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,710
molecular weight because we've added a

312
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,440
mole of hydrogen here so the

313
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:16,350
corresponding THC a compound would be

314
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,600
358 we add a mole of hydrogen we move

315
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,389
the molecular weight up to 360 and you

316
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,850
know lo and behold we see M minus 1

317
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:28,199
which is 359 because this is in the

318
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:30,180
minus mode of the mass spectrometer this

319
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,590
is just high resolution mass spec which

320
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:37,409
you know again just identifies the

321
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:43,200
identifies the the compound as being the

322
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:45,419
correct one and then we decarboxylate

323
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,960
and when we decarboxylate we make hexa

324
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:50,429
hydro cannabinol which is this and you

325
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,860
can see there's two nice aromatic

326
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:54,599
signals two nice aromatic signals and

327
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,149
just a beautiful set of signals here

328
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,019
this is a very very very clean compound

329
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,939
also psychologically active or

330
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:06,929
psychoactive when we dab this we have

331
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:10,710
the same profound effect maybe a little

332
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:16,979
bit slower than then THC or and maybe

333
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:20,460
lasts a little bit longer okay so we've

334
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:24,000
done this the CBD as well orange light

335
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:27,900
yellow light so we did this to see CBD

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,820
and we've done this to THC now let's

337
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,509
talk about the biological effects of

338
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,510
these materials

339
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:40,629
so recall the Kim assay showed that

340
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:43,600
these compounds were anti-angiogenic I

341
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:46,149
think they speculated in a paper that it

342
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,790
was asked acting on V GE F but I don't

343
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:51,370
think they actually knew the mechanism

344
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:54,519
of its anti-angiogenic activity so what

345
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:58,389
we did is we we looked in in in these

346
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:01,360
little guys right here and looked at a

347
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:05,350
very aggressive form of brain tumor

348
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,690
called glioblastoma multiforme and we

349
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,399
did a test where we used the vehicle

350
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,350
that we're injecting into the mice just

351
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,919
as a control and then looked at

352
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:17,860
comparing th CA to the h8 CA and CB da

353
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:20,229
to the hydrogenated versions and here

354
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,480
all we're doing is we're sacrificing the

355
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,310
animals taking the tumours out and

356
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,909
weighing them and just looking for a

357
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:31,649
change

358
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:34,899
in tumor weight what we observe is that

359
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:36,909
left unchecked the tumors will grow but

360
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:40,899
when treated with cannabinoids at this

361
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:43,269
arbitrary rate of 10 milligrams per

362
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:46,179
kilogram body weight that we do see

363
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:50,069
lowering of the tumor sizes and in fact

364
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:54,309
it looks as though the hydrogenation

365
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:56,950
improves the activity of the

366
00:16:54,309 --> 00:17:00,609
non-hydrogenated cannabinoids and that's

367
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:02,830
more more apparent in this chart right

368
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,309
here where you could see hydrogenation

369
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:09,569
providing a slight improvement to th CA

370
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:12,399
activity and hydrogenation here

371
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:20,409
providing a much more market improvement

372
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:22,420
to CBD a we're following up this work in

373
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,380
a collaboration with Professor Roger

374
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,170
Pertwee

375
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,120
University of Aberdeen in Scotland to

376
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,910
get cb1 binding numbers and we have a

377
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,709
bunch of assays sort of in the works and

378
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:36,750
we're also doing some more follow-up

379
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:38,970
work to understand what type of

380
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:43,619
mechanism might be at work in

381
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,620
controlling these tumor sizes

382
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,720
what was known quite some time ago in

383
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,570
1991 is hexa hydro cannabinol actually

384
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:58,430
does undergo metabolic oxidation similar

385
00:17:53,569 --> 00:18:02,210
to that of THC and so what happens is is

386
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,740
apparently in this is the THC and what

387
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,100
you could see here is that the 11

388
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,839
hydroxy compound is the major oxidative

389
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:11,869
metabolite component when treated with

390
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:14,629
liver microsomes what we find with h8c

391
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:16,759
not the acid but with h8c is we see a

392
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,680
similar metabolic profile so even though

393
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,809
there is no double bond here we still

394
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,779
see oxidation at the 11th position and

395
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:25,429
oxidation here at the 8th position so

396
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:27,740
this is basically an indiscriminate

397
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,380
oxidation that's still oxidizing these

398
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:33,589
carbons even though there is no double

399
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:36,380
bond present but notice that our 11

400
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:38,240
hydroxy metabolite is a different 11

401
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,690
hydroxy metabolite then shows up on

402
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:45,799
urine tests so the idea here is you can

403
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,059
take this and pass the test get it get

404
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:52,339
it get it get it

405
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:54,710
okay so hydrogenated cannabis oil is

406
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:56,179
basically prepared by hydrogenation of

407
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,460
extracts it converts the

408
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,590
tetrahydrocannabinol at the hexahydrate

409
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,660
cannabinoids in this case we have a new

410
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:06,349
composition of matter a billion-dollar

411
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:09,290
molecule it has similar oxidative

412
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:11,599
metabolism to THC a I can tell you it

413
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:14,299
comes with a pretty fragrant and floral

414
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,789
taste and certainly the psychoactive

415
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:21,379
effects that are noted here on this

416
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:24,549
chart so now when you do a search for

417
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:28,090
this structure in chemical abstracts

418
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:31,879
what you find is one reference my patent

419
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:33,829
thank you very much and we got a notice

420
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,100
of allowance from the USPTO just a

421
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:39,230
couple of weeks ago saying that we have

422
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:41,299
an allowed patent here so this is really

423
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,720
cool when you're an inventor this is a

424
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:47,210
great thing to get so I would just like

425
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,579
to thank these folks shocker and and and

426
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,710
many who did the anti-angiogenic testing

427
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:53,480
at the Albany College of Pharmacy Chris

429
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,278
clear concentrates out in Los Angeles

430
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:01,639
this is his brand Baroni extract severe

431

00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:12,108
and my very talented patent attorney who

435
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:14,918
I'm greatly indebted to and you for your

436
