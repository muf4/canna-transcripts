1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,690
thanks really some wonderful talks I

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,949
might actually be bringing it down here

3
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,138
because I'm going to go back to this

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:15,570
sort of purified compounds of synthetic

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,489
compounds THC and CBD and really focus

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,778
on those but kind of what I'm hoping to

7
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:22,309
get out of this talk with you is to have

8
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:27,000
some sort of knowledge of the basic

9
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:29,070
mechanisms that are sort of you can be

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:41,100
seen across both with THC and CBD that

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:42,359
lead to anti-tumor activity nope oh I

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:52,350
might need a little bit of help here on

13
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:55,859
that good great I'm out in San Francisco

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,629
this is just a picture of our Institute

15
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,210
and we're located right downtown by the

16
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:01,710
ballpark I don't think this group really

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,239
needs the definition of cannabinoid so

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,579
I'll skip this slide and I'll go through

19
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:09,840
a couple quickly quickly so we can get

20
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:11,429
to questions I really just here I'm just

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,079
trying to show you the structural

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,210
diversity of cannabinoids I've always

23
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:22,109
been impressed by it I'm sorry let's see

24
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:24,868
if we can go back and there we go so we

25
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:27,140
have our of course natural plant derived

26
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:29,159
cannabinoids we have synthetic versions

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,629
this is a compound I'm going to talk

28
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,270
about later which I've really developed

29
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:36,709
to focus on anti-tumor properties we

30
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:39,030
have our endogenous agonists our

31
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:41,309
cannabinoid receptor antagonists and

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,140
this is one of my recent favorites we

33
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,000
liked I just call it PCP because it's a

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,739
mouthful but um this is from the

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,060
terpenes and again it's a CB - Agnes

36
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,059
really impressive for a plant

37
00:01:53,269 --> 00:02:02,219
all right so this is basically a

38
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,290
clinical review of many basically

39
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,150
therapeutic agents that they're or

40
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,740
either been in the clinic or are

41
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,990
actually making their way through the

42
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,879
clinic through what I call more standard

43
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,280
routes more standard drug development

44
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,930
routes so you can read through those but

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,539
I'm actually going to focus here down on

46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,860
the anti tumour agents and this you

47
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,019
might not be as familiar with but

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,980
there's actually three companies right

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,450
now I'm gonna talk a little bit about

50
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,259
this clinical trial and that data

51
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:30,509
they're actually going after targeting

52
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:32,549
brain cancer in patients so this is

53
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,319
actually we'll have some data these are

54
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,260
basically they're getting the trials a

55
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,439
set up but again in these cases they're

56
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,840
using cannabinoid base this the trial

57
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,370
I'll show you is the sativex iNSYS

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,319
therapeutics is going to use CBD alone

59
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,420
and this company is using a synthetic

60
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:55,439
version of THC that is not psychoactive

61
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:57,299
called Dex in Avenel so why cancer let

62
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,180
me talk a little bit about cannabinoids

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,550
and cancer so first of all we're all

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,409
very familiar with using THC and

65
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,880
cannabis based products to treat the

66
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,609
symptoms associated with cancer

67
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,289
treatment inhibition of pain enhanced to

68
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,000
enhance appetite and decreased nausea

69
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,489
but actually there's very strong

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,639
preclinical data showing that both CBD

71
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,890
and THC act as direct anti tumor agents

72
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,719
in addition there's pre canola

73
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:24,569
preclinical evidence and this is all in

74
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,629
mouse models showing that the both CBD

75
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,310
and THC can inhibit chemotherapy induced

76
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:30,989
neuropathy which can be a real issue

77
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,390
with a subpopulation of people getting

78
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:36,300
treated for cancers and finally some of

79
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:40,500
the more recent data shows that both CBD

80
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,910
and THC can sensitize the cancer cells

81
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,979
to first-line agents so you have a

82
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,030
direct activity on inhibiting cancer

83
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,768
progression and you have the ability to

84
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,360
sensitize the first-line agents that

85
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:52,709
you're gonna get in your cancer therapy

86
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,480
so I like to think of all of that kind

87
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,890
of building into a funnel and in the end

88
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,179
what you get is of course we have the

89
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:58,619
improved palliative care that we all

90
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,540
know about but the hope is here that

91
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,159
we're going to be able to also inhibit

92
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,159
cancer progression and prolong survival

93
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,660
this is a historical slide and I like to

94
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,359
kind of it's fun because it kind of

95
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:14,430
shows the small world of cannabinoid

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,750
science so the first study that showed

97
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,269
anti-tumor activity of cannabinoids

98
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,779
direct anti-tumor activity was done in

99
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:24,300
1975 by dr. Munson he happened to me my

100
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,559
toxicology teacher at school at that

101
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,030
time I didn't even know he had done this

102
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:34,019
study but that's how small that world is

103
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:35,549
I in about 1998 Christina Sanchez who we

104
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,169
do she's been talked about a couple of

105
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,689
times here she did one of the first

106
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,090
studies it was a very sort of lo small

107
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:45,600
paper just looking at the ability of THC

108
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:47,399
to inhibit the viability of glioma cells

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,020
in culture and I saw that and I thought

110
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,609
wow that doesn't look like a standard

111
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,919
typical cannabinoid profile and that's

112
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,100
why I got into the field because of that

113
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,980
that single paper by Christina and about

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,540
two years later Manuel Guzman's group

115
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,970
the group in Spain actually published

116
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,680
this pivotal paper was a nature medicine

117
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,140
paper which really caused the resurgence

118
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,209
of focusing research on the direct

119
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,009
anti-tumor activity of cannabinoids and

120
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,930
that's resulted in over 100 publications

121
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:18,719
now across many different types of

122
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:20,939
cancers there is this very complex a

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,230
signal transduction pathway I'm not

124
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,418
going to go over all that I really just

125
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,759
want to focus on two things I just want

126
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:27,810
you to remember a toff AG mediated cell

127
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,269
death because that's going to come up

128
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,250
again i that's an important aspect of

129
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:37,709
the ability of at least with THC and CBD

130
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:40,290
to kill cancer cells another portion I

131
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:42,239
want you to focus on is this amp k now

132
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,870
this is an r OS sensor so when you get

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,759
reactive oxygen species in the body this

134
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,530
is a sensor of reactive oxygen species

135
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,209
and I'm going to talk why I think

136
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,889
reactive oxygen species are critical in

137
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:55,699
terms of the anti-tumor properties of

138
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,699
THC and CBD

139
00:05:57,288 --> 00:06:01,788
so back to Cristina's paper soon after

140
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,919
that paper because I'm a pharmacologist

141
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:05,209
I specialize in cannabinoid compounds I

142
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,338
screened all the compounds I had

143
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:10,519
available in the lab and what was most

144
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:11,749
surprising to me is that out of all the

145
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,408
compounds I screen

146
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:16,550
cannabidiol was the most potent and

147
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:18,199
thanks Deborah earlier for talking about

148
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,588
micro molar but this is all expressed in

149
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,999
micro molar that surprised me because a

150
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:26,240
lot of literature was suggesting this

151
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:28,729
was cannabinoid receptor mediated but

152
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,228
CBD doesn't interact efficiently there

153
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:35,449
was receptors it certainly doesn't

154
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:37,550
activate them another thing of course to

155
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:42,259
me was a great interest as as as we all

156
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,369
know THC gets you high CBD does not now

157
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,729
why is that important to me as a

158
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:48,409
scientist it's an easier grant to sell I

159
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:50,088
know it sounds crazy but is a much

160
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:53,149
easier grant to sell when you go in and

161
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:54,949
say I'm going to use THC it's gonna NIH

162
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,079
is gonna get nervous so I knew right

163
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,908
away with focusing on CBD that that

164
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,408
would actually get them more interest

165
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:02,269
and at least get me funding so I could

166
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:03,978
study both the compounds and so that's

167
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:09,199
the strategy I took and it worked rather

168
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:11,870
well and this is kind of just an

169
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,129
overview of the efficacy data and in

170
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,769
vivo models so what we have here is this

171
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:21,408
is a triple negative breast cancer model

172
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:22,759
in mice these are lungs so the the tumor

173
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,680
actually metastasized to the lungs

174
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,509
here's actually you can see the very

175
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,939
prominent tumor formation in the lungs

176
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,218
and here's a mouse treated with CBD it's

177
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:34,789
very obvious the efficacy of the

178
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:36,918
compound we also looked at the same CBD

179
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,110
and brain cancer and here see the purple

180
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,838
portion this is all tumors throughout

181
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,819
their brain this is a GBM or a very

182
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:45,559
aggressive form of brain cancer and here

183
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:47,749
again is once you treat with CBD you can

184
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:50,269
really see it's localized to one one

185
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:54,499
region so just some of the efficacy data

186
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:56,509
right up front okay so here's my

187
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,769
complicated pathway but really what I

188
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,800
want you to get out of this is just to

189
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:02,209
remember some key key sort of words so

190
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,459
that when people ask you about direct

191
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:06,259
anti tumor agents Kannamma desist direct

192
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:08,838
anti tumor agents you can say oh yeah

193
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:10,069
etapa G reactive oxygen species and

194
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:14,060
hopefully ID one because that's my

195
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:20,000
at gene so basically where I'm gonna

196
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:24,889
focus first on our OS so what we found

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,209
and in this case this is a triple

198
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,990
negative a human triple negative breast

199
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:31,699
cancer and what we found is that when

200
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,918
you increase the concentration of CBD

201
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,899
you produce a fairly profound amount of

202
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,490
reactive oxygen species now for all

203
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,829
cells that's bad if you produce too much

204
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,509
cancer cells actually have mechanisms to

205
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,400
deal with our OS because they're more

206
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,830
metabolically active than normal cells

207
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,569
so they actually have mechanisms to deal

208
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,000
with this but at a certain point they

209
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,530
can't deal with the ro s overload so and

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,509
what's interesting here is this is

211
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,909
peroxide this is our positive control so

212
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:57,409
you can see in this cancer cell CBDs

213
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:01,189
highly effective opportunities in

214
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:03,799
reactive oxygen species now if you then

215
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,340
take a normal non transform cell and

216
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,809
compare it to this is a the mouse breast

217
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,139
can't a triple negative the human breast

218
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:13,819
cancer you can see that the drug is much

219
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:15,919
more effective at producing reactive

220
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,570
oxygen species and cancer cells but not

221
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,759
normal cells and that data has been

222
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,930
basically the selectivity between normal

223
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,240
cells and cancer cells as has been shown

224
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:29,389
by many groups that these compounds are

225
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,769
selective okay so definitely no reason

226
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:32,559
to really focus on all the data here

227
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:36,230
this is really to make a point we

228
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,989
basically got many actually primary

229
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,330
tumors from brain cancer patients we

230
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,490
treated a variety of these tumors with

231
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,680
CBD and we wanted to get a gene

232
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,779
expression profile across many tumors

233
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,370
from many different patients to look at

234
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:51,769
some of the key pathways so that are

235
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,539
either upregulated or downregulated and

236
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:57,529
what i want you to focus on here again

237
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:59,959
is with CBD one of the top pathways was

238
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:02,209
a toughie g and again that circles back

239
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,280
to THC which is also producing the toff

240
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:07,400
Jimmy D ated cell death so now we have

241
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,709
THC and CBD quite different but both

242
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,740
impinging upon the citavi mediated cell

243
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,720
death we also um it doesn't really

244
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,840
matter about these names these represent

245
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,000
pathways that absorb our OS so when you

246
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,820
over produce our OS these are pathways

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,779
that basically get up regulates or deal

248
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,780
with that insult

249
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:28,639
so that this was another top hit in

250
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,139
these cells so really these cells when

251
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,639
they're treated with cannabidiol they're

252
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:34,429
dealing with a lot of our OS and so

253
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:37,250
these pathways are upregulated and we

254
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:39,709
showed that actually in preclinical

255
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,509
mouse models of brain cancer so not only

256
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,430
in culture but also in the preclinical

257
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:46,309
models so they're dealing with a lot of

258
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:49,219
our OS and finally my one of my favorite

259
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:51,199
genes ID one was highly downregulated in

260
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,550
these tumors and I'm gonna explain a

261
00:10:51,200 --> 00:11:01,400
little bit more about ID one and why

262
00:10:52,549 --> 00:11:03,740
it's important so ID one is a key gene

263
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,360
in the involvement of metastatic

264
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,060
progressions so if you're a localized

265
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,129
tumor and you need to get out of that

266
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:12,709
space travel through the bloodstream get

267
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:14,360
to different organs ID genes or key

268
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,980
genes you really need these genes

269
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,180
they're actually embryonic genes they're

270
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,009
not in your they're not in

271
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:20,989
differentiated adult tissue they're

272
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,090
they're from and the state when you're

273
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,019
in embryology and in that case you do

274
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,149
need the genes because you have to

275
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:27,500
develop your pathways and everything has

276
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:30,049
to travel to different sites as you're

277
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,580
as you're building the human body but in

278
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:33,319
the case of cancer what it does is it

279
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,879
you SERPs that gene and brings it back

280
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,620
in the adult tissues and then it allows

281
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,080
it to travel and go to distant sites so

282
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,529
it's it's in terms of a cancer patient

283
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:45,020
if you have this gene it's it's not good

284
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:51,230
prognosis for you so what I'm showing

285
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:53,059
you here is that across many different

286
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,399
types of cancers so this is called a

287
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:58,338
Western basically this is the expression

288
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,929
of the ID one protein okay when you

289
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:03,200
don't see the black that means that it's

290
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:05,779
gone and so we looked across all sorts

291
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,089
of aggressive cancers that actually

292
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:09,889
Express these proteins and we found

293
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,860
across all of these cancers if you treat

294
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:15,850
them with CBD you basically are able to

295
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,850
turn off this gene

296
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:23,308
and the way that ID one works is it's a

297
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:25,290
negative transcriptional regulator so it

298
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:26,759
actually when it binds it turns off

299
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:30,419
transcription but that's important

300
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:32,669
downstream and let me explain why so I

301
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:35,458
like to think of ID 1 as sort of a

302
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,558
conductor or sort of the conductor of

303
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,388
many events that happen downstream in

304
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:42,749
the process of metastasis it's kind of a

305
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:44,519
master regulator so upstream when this

306
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:48,480
gets turned on it causes all these

307
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,730
downstream events that then lead to

308
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,649
different aspects of metastatic

309
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,298
progression so if you can actually cut

310
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,339
off the master regulator you can cut off

311
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:57,958
all these downstream events and there's

312
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,179
been lots of publications by other

313
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,338
scientists showing indeed this is the

314
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:05,578
case so again a very important gene in

315
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,559
metastatic progression and this is just

316
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:11,338
many papers just talking about how

317
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:13,230
important ID one is and cancer so here's

318
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,299
some of the original data that we

319
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,659
published again back to our Western

320
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:20,909
analysis here's ID one gene can see it's

321
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,889
expressed here as you add more drug it

322
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:24,058
basically disappears in fact the first

323
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:26,329
Western we did we thought we made a

324
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:28,798
mistake because generally don't see that

325
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:30,868
we compare it against other cannabinoid

326
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:33,119
drugs this is just ID one expression you

327
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:34,829
can see it's a effective again at down

328
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:37,259
regulating that expression but other

329
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:39,508
cannabinoids are less effective and one

330
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,178
measure of studying metastasis at least

331
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,798
in culture is looking at invasion the

332
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:45,509
ability of these cells to invade through

333
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:47,399
matrix which is kind of a representation

334
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,869
of them invading through tissues and

335
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,399
again the drug is effective in

336
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:55,079
inhibiting invasion which makes sense

337
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,970
with down-regulating this gene and this

338
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,859
is a review of sort of our approach

339
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,899
taken a standard pharmacological

340
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,970
approach so we have CBD it's an

341
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,519
effective inhibitor of id-1 as a

342
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,869
pharmacologist what we do next is we try

343
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,249
and create analogs that are even more

344
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:13,889
active than CBD at targeting id-1 and so

345
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:15,509
I'd like to call this drug not really

346
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,389
cannabinoid anymore it's called a it's

347
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:20,278
actually a resorcinol derivative i liked

348
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:22,798
it this term it as an ID one inhibitor

349
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,769
so if we go down to our western analysis

350
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:29,308
again here's CBD and here is the analog

351
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:31,649
which is more potent at inhibiting id-1

352
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:34,919
so what does that mean

353
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:36,750
so in least with metastatic breast

354
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,219
cancer when a patient comes in and

355
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,379
presents that's usually later stage

356
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,570
right a lot of the preclinical models

357
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,850
don't actually model later stage they

358
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,680
model earlier stage so what we did is

359
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,170
because of course you're most likely to

360
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,199
get the drug at a more advanced stage we

361
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:54,569
modeled that in my in mice and we had

362
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,100
two models we used we had one model

363
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,379
which is a mouse triple negative breast

364
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,750
cancer in this case they have the mouse

365
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,899
as a functional immune system and in

366
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,700
this case you have basically an immune

367
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,699
system that's been compromised so that

368
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:13,050
the mouse can actually grow a human

369
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:15,778
metastatic tumor so two models and we

370
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:17,669
compared in the first mouse model we

371
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:20,429
just compared the activity of CBD and

372
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:21,990
our analog let me just kind of orient

373
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:25,500
you to this a hundred percent means the

374
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,419
mouse all patients or mice are alive and

375
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,970
then as it decreases this is mice that

376
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,409
don't survive in this model basically as

377
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,730
soon as they start to show a symptom of

378
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:35,569
tumor burden they're taken out of the

379
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:39,000
study and so here's the control group

380
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:41,790
here's CBD in terms of survival and here

381
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,559
is the analog we created so at two

382
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:45,750
months 50% of the mice were still alive

383
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,939
which with this very aggressive model is

384
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,669
very impressive now I should note that

385
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,500
with CBD in the earlier stage of models

386
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,939
it was effective in earlier stage models

387
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,009
but as we got to the more advanced stage

388
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,140
models it wasn't as effective

389
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:00,980
hence the thought to create an analogue

390
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,899
and really focus in on the ID protein

391
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,570
story because it already shown using

392
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,250
genetic approaches that if you basically

393
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,200
decreased the expression this gene you

394
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,639
could produce substantial inhibition of

395
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,509
metastatic progression so that was the

396
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:18,179
idea there and again we use advanced

397
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:20,789
stages here advanced stage model here

398
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,528
and again this analog was quite

399
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:27,449
effective and increasing survival at

400
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:29,700
least in this model so based on the

401
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,980
literature with ID proteins if you down

402
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,860
regulate the ID protein what you do is

403
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,240
you will sensitize the cancers and this

404
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,769
is multiple types of cancers to

405
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,500
first-line agents just because of the

406
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,529
way the gene works so of course the

407
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,089
simple experiment would be well of CBD

408
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,889
can down regulate this gene it should be

409
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,439
desensitize the cancers to first-line

410
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:51,389
agents and this is what we call a

411
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:53,009
combination index plot you don't really

412
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,539
need to understand it basically all you

413
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:57,778
need to know is that anything below one

414
00:16:54,539 --> 00:17:00,808
is a synergistic activity so we combined

415
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:02,308
CBD with a standard first-line agent for

416
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:04,649
a triple negative breast cancer

417
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:07,259
paclitaxel and as you can see in both

418
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,759
this in 41 cell lines this is a

419
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,038
derivative of that triple negative human

420
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,379
breast cancer cell line I showed you you

421
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:19,140
can see synergistic activity at least in

422
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:20,909
culture and so that's I like to

423
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,120
transition into this case study based on

424
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:26,490
that data so since the publication with

425
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,408
CBD and ID proteins and just our groups

426
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,819
focus on cancer I get a lot of case

427
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:32,730
reports sent to me from patients

428
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:35,189
particularly when it's a good basically

429
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,808
when they've seen efficacy of course

430
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,130
there's definitely cases where I've seen

431
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:39,869
patients that have been honest have said

432
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,250
that the drug didn't work but in a

433
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:43,528
cancer setting that makes complete sense

434
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,869
not every tumor is going to respond

435
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:48,538
that's just not possible but here's a

436
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:51,178
success case this is a a patient that

437
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:53,879
actually had metastatic breast cancer

438
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,500
they were treated originally but then it

439
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,559
recurred and you can see it's it's

440
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,970
fairly dramatic you can see basically

441
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,269
tumors all over the body

442
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,919
this patient then went on a cannabis oil

443
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:06,538
I don't know the makeup of the oil I

444
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,899
didn't get that information from

445
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:11,940
September 2013 to January 2014 along

446
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:13,319
with the first-line agent okay so they

447
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,970
did go back in for another round their

448
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:16,889
first-line agent and you can see

449
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,329
basically this is what happened with the

450
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,580
patient that came back it's very

451
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:22,139
dramatic I mean this is unusual to say

452
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:26,329
the least but it is you know it's

453
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,330
convincing antidotal evidence certainly

454
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,500
and finally this question comes up a lot

455
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,480
and I think you know I can tell this is

456
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,079
great in in this form because of the

457
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,710
talks before me what's better the drug

458
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:42,960
alone CBD alone or CBD combined with THC

459
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,130
and now of course THC CBD and all these

460
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,630
other components that could be in

461
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,230
cannabis that's a question I get a lot

462
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:51,360
the answer is I think it's you know it's

463
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,548
gonna be very specific not only for the

464
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,288
cancer you try and treat but also the

465
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:56,308
subtypes within a cancer and I'm just

466
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:58,079
going to show you a little bit of what I

467
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:59,009
call hard evidence to show you that the

468
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,609
complexity of this

469
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,859
so here is this model of metastasis

470
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,689
again this is a hundred percent

471
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:09,149
metastasis and as it as the number goes

472
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,490
down it means there's less metastasis so

473
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,980
we this is at least in this model this

474
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,990
is the most inhibition that THC can

475
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,089
produce and this was the most inhibition

476
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,400
that CBD could produce this is a maximum

477
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:22,709
effective dose but when you combine them

478
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,019
you actually get greater activity so I

479
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,940
could say in this model at least in the

480
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,759
forty one triple negative model

481
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,039
combining THC and CBD is more effective

482
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:36,690
than either of the drugs alone however

483
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:38,579
if we then take this is a study we

484
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,400
recently did where we compared the

485
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:44,869
ability of CBD versus CBD plus THC this

486
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,330
is a one-to-one ratio to basically

487
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:51,089
enhance the activity of TMZ in a and

488
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:53,789
this is a GBM model a glioblastoma model

489
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:55,679
brain cancer and again this is a

490
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:59,480
survival curve but let's focus on here

491
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:04,140
this is basically CBD plus TMZ and

492
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:07,579
versus CBD sorry CBD alone versus CVD

493
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,590
plus TMZ now overall they didn't produce

494
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:12,809
they enhanced the activity of CBD

495
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:14,939
certainly so that's a very positive

496
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:16,589
result but if you compare the two drugs

497
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,750
there's really no difference between

498
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:22,319
using CBD alone versus the combination

499
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,000
however in this case a subset of animals

500
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,789
the tumors did regress completely and

501
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,069
didn't return in the CBD group so and

502
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:30,480
that has happened before that also

503
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,740
happened in that original nature paper I

504
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,589
showed you as well when they were using

505
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:39,480
THC alone so again overall survival no

506
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:41,009
but if you were if you were this patient

507
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,349
you'd be very happy about getting CBD

508
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:45,809
alone right so it's it's a complex

509
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:47,250
problem we've looked at only a small

510
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,079
amount of tumors right now what we're

511
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,970
trying to do is look across many

512
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,009
different patient types of tumors to get

513
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:57,360
more of a profile but I think it will be

514
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:59,819
a complicated question so yep this

515
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,789
brings us finally to the GBM trial

516
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:04,470
that's actually was done by GW

517
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:07,139
Pharmaceuticals and I'm gonna quickly

518
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:10,170
just go over this basically they the

519
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,150
patients were on board with Sativex

520
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,360
I have all the the dose and information

521
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,330
on

522
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:18,029
I got this off of basically this is off

523
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:19,619
the clinical trials so I g ee hasn't

524
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:21,599
published a detail so if I'm wrong and

525
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:23,519
GW is here they can inform us but

526
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,639
basically what they found it's a pretty

527
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,319
impressive enhancement or of survival

528
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,400
when they are treated with Sativex so

529
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,240
again they went from basically let's see

530
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,170
sorry

531
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,690
oh basically they went from 369 in the

532
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,700
controls to 550 days with the treatment

533
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,679
so that's that's actually fairly

534
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,150
impressive in GBM what's hope that it

535
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,419
pans out when they go to a larger

536
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,160
clinical trial and there's just the

537
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,820
conclusion and so I'll say thank you

538
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,820
very much for your time

539
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,549
you
