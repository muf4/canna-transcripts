1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,419
hello

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
I want to repeat our last speaker and

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:09,779
first say thank you to uh medicinal

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,919
genomics advanced nutrients for the

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,899
invitation

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,298
and two probably address the question

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,460
that you either saw reading the agenda

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,618
or you thought of sitting here were you

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,839
seeing with this title what in the world

10
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,579
can a plant scientist

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,379
from Texas a state with one of the most

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,959
challenging deficient or add your own

13
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,599
expletive term Medical

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,299
policies have in a conference full of

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,619
medical practitioners and I would hope

16
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,319
with a little bit of transfer of

17
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:39,479
knowledge and exercise I can demonstrate

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,219
that it is and the first request I have

19
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:42,479
would you everyone that's here if you

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,679
have a cell phone would you hold up your

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,419
cell phone

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,039
does anybody in here not have a cell

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,059
phone

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,920
all right

25
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,019
every single one of you is holding a

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,640
handheld phenomic tool

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,559
you're just playing games on it and not

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,859
using it for what it could be used for

29
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,078
that's my transfer learning exercise

30
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,019
all right my background is perennial

31
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,118
grasses 16 plus years three in cannabis

32
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,340
so I'm not a legacy breeder I'm an

33
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,879
upstart a new

34
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,200
I have a love of spewing plants as

35
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,478
biorefineries integrated biorefineries

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,719
and this is from brilliant scientists in

37
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,938
Germany who corrupted me influenced me

38
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:23,759
back in 2006 and seven when I was

39
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,399
turning grass into ethanol or biofuels

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,200
and I was able to put on a second hat

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,420
which is good for me I'm follicly

42
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,040
challenged I not only work with putting

43
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,740
your grasses I now work with Industrial

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,618
Hemp an industrial hemp to me

45
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,298
it's not one commodity it's as many

46
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,400
Commodities as you can create from that

47
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,280
plant it is an integrated biorefiner

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,740
it's built that way it may be the best

49
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,859
example of a plant by a Refinery out

50
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,859
there

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,020
okay if I leave out all the perennial

52
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,880
grasswork and just focus on what we're

53
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,679
trying to do in hemp it is about

54
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,359
Refinery and I'm going to boil this down

55
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,700
even further to our handheld phenomics

56
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,259
scope for this talk but our waiting

57
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,079
program views it as such we're working

58
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,419
on multi-use hemp fiber grain

59
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,878
cannabinoid any use of those anything

60
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,399
you can convert with it and as a plant

61
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,899
breeder Europe has not been advanced in

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,360
a conventional sense compared to Corn

63
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,300
other major crops in 80 years so a lot

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,440
of our work is to make modern types of

65
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,180
cultivars pure lines F1 hybrids Blitz

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,800
your patents on one your plant variety

67
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,340
patents on the other and you have Rock

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Solid intellectual property okay

69
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,800
tetraploids things I've done in

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,139
perennial grasses it's popular in hemp

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,819
now triploid seed sterile these are your

72
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,259
seedless bananas seedless grapes you do

73
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,000
that with CBD hemp now there's no

74
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,219
concern for pollen

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
type fives everything in this conference

76
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,699
has to do with type ones and twos a

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,039
little bit of type threes type fives

78
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:53,399
have their place

79
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,780
Texas Southern U.S we're here in Florida

80
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,519
heat and drought tolerance if we're

81
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,620
going to move this crop Outdoors as some

82
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,599
of proposes important uh that's part of

83
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,980
our work and when I started working at

84
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,679
him three years ago I had absolutely

85
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,719
zero seed in my seed room

86
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,040
so trying to develop a germplasm

87
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,439
collection that's available it's public

88
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,060
and it's adapted to subtropical and

89
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,139
tropical latitudes is also a big part of

90
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,780
our program

91
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,639
and if you look at the very bottom of

92
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,378
that picture on the right that's really

93
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,598
where we are today I'm going to try to

94
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,399
introduce just three little components

95
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,139
to try to make my job easier as a plant

96
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,719
breeder we need things to look at plants

97
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:30,119
get data points rapidly and cost

98
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,519
efficiently

99
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,140
and I would say

100
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,760
it's not an argument of University

101
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,518
versus industry doing this kind of

102
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,280
research we are University scientists we

103
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,439
are in arm of industry for their

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,840
research okay

105
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,359
that's a disclosure I do work for a

106
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,299
behemoth of a bureaucracy

107
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,280
universities and we are regulated by the

108
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,439
states as are in all states that have

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,539
cannabis policies that said we have a

110
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,340
lot of supporting offices at a m that

111
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:00,780
are involved with hemp we have a

112
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,280
beautiful office that helps us engage

113
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,378
with industry

114
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,878
we have faculty and extension that are

115
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,459
running trials and cropping systems and

116
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,500
how to get this outside we have people

117
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,620
working on Hop latent Pathologists we

118
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,180
have Gene editing being conducted and we

119
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,160
also have

120
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,560
students very very interested in this so

121
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,419
much so they have started the only

122
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,819
University organized Club around

123
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,198
cannabis and him

124
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:26,839
okay

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,919
that said

126
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,619
repeating to some of the ethos of this

127
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,079
conference I'm going to propose

128
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,540
broad spectrum if not pool Spectrum but

129
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,219
Ross rectum approaches but we all do

130
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,180
what you all do you bring your life to

131
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,040
cannabis

132
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,959
okay and these phenomics tools are

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,520
around three specific portions of that

134
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,959
Spectrum

135
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,879
the first tool this has been the

136
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,859
toughest for me I've had

137
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,839
more failures than I would like but not

138
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,759
as many as Edison had and we have a tool

139
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,679
now that's very interesting and it's

140
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,780
based around near infrared your infrared

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,000
has been around for decades uh in

142
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:03,119
forages we use that to quantify all

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,740
sorts of composition and and quality

144
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,978
so it's not a stretch to say that's

145
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,540
already already in the book and canned

146
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:11,339
miniaturized versions of these they were

147
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,919
put on cell phones

148
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,299
seven eight years ago 2016. it would

149
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,439
just make your iPhone three times as

150
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,780
expensive

151
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,000
not much of a customer base for that but

152
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,579
miniature NRS platforms are there they

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,680
exist workflows that are very typical of

154
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,300
these types of approaches screen large

155
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,600
populations

156
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,160
sample develop your modeling validate

157
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,840
those models

158
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,840
put it to work commercialize it

159
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:42,239
they're all already too if miniaturized

160
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,038
NRS platforms specifically for cannabis

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,680
you all I'm sure aware of these

162
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,360
the gem assert and the purple fro these

163
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,459
are both based on diffuse reflectance

164
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,620
they both require dried cured samples

165
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:54,599
they do give you a cost savings versus

166
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,399
hplc or GC

167
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,320
one of the biggest reasons they have not

168
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,319
been adopted widely is you cannot get

169
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,399
really high precisions or accuracies two

170
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,839
to four percent

171
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,120
in most cases

172
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,258
and they may argue you can do this in

173
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,300
real time but in reality you have to

174
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,500
have a derived cured sample they had to

175
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,759
avoid the water bands and those

176
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,740
reflectance

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,960
so

178
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,160
it limits you in those two respects and

179
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,060
that's kind of the problem you want to

180
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,919
tackle

181
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,918
with this as a breeding tool

182
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,280
in the last three years thankfully we've

183
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,978
also been able to develop our German

184
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,079
Plaza and we have large segregating

185
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:34,199
populations for THC CBD and many of

186
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,538
these cannabinoids so we have the nir

187
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,419
we have the populations

188
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:41,759
and I've done phonomics in my lab we've

189
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:43,139
done these things with UAV data we've

190
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
done this with grandparent training

191
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,220
radar so the analytics side and the

192
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,560
modeling is there

193
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,840
what's missing we want to tackle with

194
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,000
this tool

195
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,379
was the sampling what and how you're

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,060
going to sample what and how you're

197
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,100
going to take the data point and how

198
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,780
you're going to process that

199
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,160
and I apologize for this being a black

200
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,739
box

201
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,680
this took longer than I wanted to take

202
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,300
we do have three very novel very

203
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
non-obvious components of how we're

204
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,079
collecting this data how we're sampling

205
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,659
these plants

206
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,758
and we have enabled this to the point

207
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,439
where it is accurate

208
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,020
much more than the two products on the

209
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,719
market and in addition it lets us sample

210
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:26,459
dry or wet tissue so it can be very

211
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,919
non-destructive it can be done anywhere

212
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:31,258
in the life cycle of these plants

213
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,379
and that gives us something that is uh

214
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:36,000
patentable we disclose that and that

215
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:38,219
bureaucracy I mentioned that moves slow

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,079
sometimes slower than rosin coming out

217
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,539
of a freeze dryer

218
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,899
is still reviewing it So the plan is to

219
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,579
put IP protection on these and

220
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,500
that license will be held by our

221
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,598
sponsors who are here today

222
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,459
railroad genomics they enable this work

223
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,560
again we are the research arm in this

224
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,239
effort

225
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,038
and if you'd like to visit with them if

226
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,660
you don't haven't seen them yet please

227
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,379
search them out or come find me and I'm

228
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,380
happy to introduce you

229
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,740
right

230
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,799
moving from infrared to visible

231
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,379
this has been something as an academic

232
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,598
Professor undergraduate classes

233
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,000
graduate students the student clubs

234
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,038
students in my lab working on trichomes

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,439
these beautiful structures silica

236
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,839
dioxide full of things that we use

237
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,699
and the colors

238
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,918
that they reflect

239
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:33,060
trying to gauge trichome size maturity

240
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,059
and their other secondary phytochemicals

241
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,000
this has been very easy to adopt

242
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:42,418
with the advance of your cell phones and

243
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,940
very very small microscopes you can put

244
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:46,740
on those those foam attachments now that

245
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,260
have beautiful Optics

246
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,839
almost to the stage of a thousand eggs

247
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:54,000
ocular magnification you combine those

248
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,740
with those two apps almost any person

249
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,399
within half an hour can get pictures of

250
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,360
trichomes at 600x magnification

251
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,740
calibrate those scales and get your

252
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,259
diameters

253
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,419
the the larger trick is to try to

254
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,059
quantify how much you have on a bud

255
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,679
on a BRAC Leaf in a sample you can do

256
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:12,539
that with a little bit of image analysis

257
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,059
these are older Technologies you're 20

258
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:16,799
years old imagej openc you can use these

259
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,958
in open source Scripts

260
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,099
in the end you're making grayscale

261
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,099
images

262
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,899
and looking for circles

263
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,240
the tricome size is one of the easier

264
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,860
ones to to attack with digital

265
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,600
microscopy

266
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,120
with your cell phones and a little bit

267
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,278
of image analysis

268
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,560
maturity is much more difficult simply

269
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,120
due to the fact that when you use these

270
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,399
algorithms they're all based around

271
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,100
grayscale images so that you lose all

272
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,778
that data you need to gauge maturity

273
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,800
so we struggle with that we looked at

274
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:47,820
different approaches we looked at

275
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,819
different things we can pull out of

276
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,320
those those images and recently it

277
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,480
dawned on me

278
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
to stop thinking linearly stop thinking

279
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,600
in two Dimensions start thinking in

280
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,339
three dimensions

281
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,259
every image you take is not a

282
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,660
two-dimensional image there's data in

283
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,580
those pixels Beyond RGB

284
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,740
if you look at the additional data you

285
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,839
can project that data and make a 3D

286
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,120
rendition of that

287
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,640
so any any computer science kid that

288
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,080
uses these Graphics to make mesh video

289
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,019
games

290
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,420
or cartoons or Comics or videos can do

291
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,899
this you're projecting some portion of

292
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:26,759
the data in that 2D image to get more 3D

293
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,440
projections of it and the first thing we

294
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,000
noticed was an inventory trichome is

295
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,560
clear optically clear there's nothing in

296
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,480
it so all you get back is the green of

297
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,759
the leaf

298
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,200
the first difficulty in doing that is

299
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,179
you get rid of the Green in today's

300
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
world we have Blockbuster films that are

301
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:42,599
covered in grease game green screens

302
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,419
it's very easy

303
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,060
to remove the green

304
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,860
and in our case we found not a need to

305
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,958
remove all of the green but some of

306
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,180
those green

307
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,500
Spectrum with that you're left with a

308
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,519
lot of trichome data and what's in the

309
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,159
trichome

310
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,659
and if you will take that

311
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,719
minus the green in the middle row there

312
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:05,639
across maturity of trichomes you can

313
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,740
then pick you can you can experiment

314
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,939
with what versions of data you would

315
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,200
like to project

316
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,880
and what we found is looking at

317
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,820
Luminosity or the overall brightness of

318
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,458
those pixels you can project those up

319
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,500
vertically and if you work with the

320
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:21,599
saturation saturation is simply the pure

321
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,578
colors of those pixels we all like

322
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,899
highly saturated pictures we like pure

323
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:26,879
blue pure red

324
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,320
and if you do that you end up with 3D

325
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,078
projections

326
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,240
you can see on the left immature largely

327
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,699
blue pixels are projected up

328
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,440
fairly mature trichomes largely green

329
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,440
some yellow

330
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,000
very mature sometimes overly mature lots

331
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,200
of orange and reds and the Beautiful

332
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,299
Thing is once you have these 3D

333
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,399
projections if you go one step further

334
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,439
and quantify the degree of redness

335
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,720
you could calibrate this

336
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,820
to harvest at your Optimum degree of

337
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,320
Amber trichomes

338
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,320
depending on what your target is

339
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,740
okay

340
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,940
trying to streamline this for breeders

341
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,259
and other practitioners if you can

342
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,420
Envision doing this at a lower

343
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,799
magnification you would make it easier

344
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,419
for someone walking through there with a

345
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,639
cell phone which can almost get you to

346
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,439
20x Optical magnification

347
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,819
and produce images like this of an

348
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
entire Bud

349
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,800
you follow the same workflow remove the

350
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,778
green do the 3D projection you can get

351
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:26,719
an absolute estimation of the maturity

352
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:26,720
of the trichome composite on those buds

353
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,039
right last tool this is the UV this is

354
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,700
something going back to my undergraduate

355
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,699
and graduate school days

356
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,300
doubling chromosomes and plants is much

357
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,000
easier than animals almost impossible in

358
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:46,199
animals in Plants you get double dosage

359
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,240
of all those genes you end up with

360
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,680
larger cells and in hemp that gives you

361
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,860
two things a great value it gives you a

362
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,359
larger seed and longer fiber I've done

363
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,419
this in the perennial grasses we did it

364
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,800
with the cannabis

365
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:01,139
the biggest headache with with

366
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,299
polyphoids the chemical you use or

367
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,579
colchicine inhibits mitosis or spindle

368
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:08,399
formation you end up with parts of the

369
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:10,458
meristem being doubled in part not you

370
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,720
end up with chimeric or mixoploid

371
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,759
Frankenstein plants so trying to

372
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,040
determine if you truly have a tetrafluid

373
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,919
plant is the bottleneck this technology

374
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,259
has not improved in my career

375
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,719
you can either count crime chromosomes

376
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,100
which is very laborious or you can use a

377
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,778
flow cytometer which is simply a

378
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,000
capillary system using a labor to

379
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:32,879
reflect

380
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,980
stained and circulated nuclei

381
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,838
and with him being a residence plant you

382
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,820
can imagine what that resin does to the

383
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,079
capillary tubing in those systems so

384
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,040
it's fraught with errors and it's

385
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,039
extremely time consuming

386
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,179
our approach has been to develop a

387
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,220
microfluiding system I know Agilent was

388
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,419
next door in the expo hall a lot of our

389
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,100
tools these days are becoming

390
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:56,039
miniaturized by simply going from

391
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,899
capillary systems to microfluidics no

392
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,879
one's done that yet with flow cytometers

393
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,159
you can do that yourself we're working

394
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,078
with it with fluid excels you buy off

395
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,059
the market or those you make yourself

396
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,759
with 3D printers and and some

397
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:12,179
imagination

398
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:14,220
same isolation of nuclei microfluidic

399
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:15,719
separation with or without electricity

400
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,778
it works either way if you want to do

401
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,519
pressure and standing with your

402
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:22,919
fluorochrome of choice we use ethanium

403
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,959
bromide because it's cheap and in that

404
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,679
case it puts you in the UV range for

405
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,679
illumination

406
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,860
that said this involves breadboards this

407
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,359
involves coating this involves a little

408
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,039
bit of Ingenuity that my students didn't

409
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,680
have time for we were faced with

410
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,719
biological deadlines and deliverable

411
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,458
deadlines for contracts we had hundreds

412
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,639
of plants we wanted to screen for

413
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:46,018
polyploidy so we went back and used

414
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,778
tools that have been done previously

415
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,959
looking at cell size

416
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:53,519
part of the cell cell wall or stomata

417
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,039
diameter of that has been related to

418
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,379
polyploidy for decades and the advantage

419
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,539
we had today were much more precise with

420
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,519
image classification and with digital

421
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:05,278
quantification of this versus our own

422
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,399
visual eyes doing that

423
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,620
looking at stomata off of lifts of

424
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,600
epidermal cells

425
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,339
and developing our models between

426
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,040
diploids and tetraploids we've gotten

427
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,600
very good at being able to

428
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,639
predict if these are going to be

429
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,459
diploids or tetrabloids and this allowed

430
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,720
a student to look at 800 plants in a

431
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,638
couple of weeks

432
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,139
versus doing a flow cytometer and taking

433
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,639
a couple of months knocking the wood

434
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,320
that everything works and nothing breaks

435
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,120
so

436
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,740
either one of these systems the

437
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,839
microfluidic version

438
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,639
or just the Imaging version could be

439
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,699
great tools for people that are in the

440
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,720
business of looking at polyploid

441
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:44,719
in cannabis

442
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,399
all of these

443
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:51,479
products have been funded enabled by our

444
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,000
research arm

445
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,860
rare economics

446
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,539
their CEO is right there their Founders

447
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,339
are there and up here

448
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,620
I encourage you to visit with them

449
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,300
without them my hip program would be a

450
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,560
lot smaller I would still be much more

451
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:06,559
of a perennial grasp reader

452
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,578
and they have other tools as well I

453
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,259
can't if I go back they've enabled other

454
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:15,659
work as well we've developed things like

455
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:18,120
like terpene-based insecticides that are

456
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:21,360
going to be disclosed very soon we've

457
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,940
developed a huge germoplasm collection

458
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,339
they now have a suite of tetraploids of

459
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,839
inbred lines of synthetic hybrids in

460
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,240
both populations so they have a huge

461
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,839
hemp germ plasma collection and the next

462
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,339
year we anticipate disclosures on

463
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,339
nanoparticles nanocellulose and

464
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,720
biocomposites so it's going to be a

465
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,959
pretty good deck they're going to have

466
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,600
for IP around hemp and cannabis

467
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,278
that said I teach a class in hemp and

468
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,560
cannabis our department Ed who is also

469
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,659
here teaches a class in hemp in cannabis

470
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,219
and we would love to teach more classes

471
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:55,259
if anyone here has interest in trying to

472
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,300
help us develop a medical cannabis

473
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,680
curriculum or any other one that might

474
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,299
be of interest to you I would love to

475
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,958
visit and see if we can build it into

476
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:06,058
some sort of a combined class

477
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:10,639
and this can be undergraduate graduate

478
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:10,639
online ceu whatever you can envision

479
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,838
the student Club I mentioned is here in

480
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:17,578
Forest it's founder and president

481
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,599
Claymore is here you might have seen him

482
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,599
around and visited with him

483
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,720
all over Achievers if you want to have

484
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,980
student involvement

485
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,980
please reach out to Clay

486
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,500
and again just turning back to the

487
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,058
narrow Focus I try to get two of these

488
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
three these three tools that relate to

489
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:36,960
medical cannabis

490
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,339
that link is to a shared drive with one

491
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,440
pages of almost everything my program

492
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,779
does most of the projects so if you'd

493
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,380
like to visit with other potential

494
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:49,160
topics around this biorefinery plant

495
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,160
please feel free to reach out

496
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:52,918
and I know Ben's not up because I always

497
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,940
finish early

498
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,940
questions are welcome

499
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:09,720
so uh were you saying that you were

500
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,419
unsuccessful with the flow cytometry to

501
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,160
identify ploidy was that a challenge to

502
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,620
to do that

503
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,419
the conventional flow cytometry yes

504
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,399
there are several problems one the

505
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,320
instruments are old

506
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,240
and two of the capillary tubing tends to

507
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,798
get plugged up by the Cannabis resin and

508
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,200
it encourages mold growth so you're

509
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,819
always trying to clean out and disinfect

510
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,620
you spend more time disinfecting that

511
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:33,119
tubing in that system than actually

512
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,399
running your samples

513
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,439
so it's just an inefficient process it's

514
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,140
efficient and the Machine still costs 30

515
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,240
grand okay it's crazy expensive you can

516
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,100
take a digital image of a triclim lift

517
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,339
using super glue and a microscope slide

518
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:50,038
of the the epidermis and classify that

519
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:51,959
stomata get the volume and as long as

520
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:53,700
you have your comparison of diploids and

521
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,900
tetraploids you'll know which class is

522
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,640
going to fall into

523
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,519
so it could be a very simple digital

524
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
imaging solution versus that old clunky

525
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,740
flow cytometer okay yeah I've seen the

526
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,038
flow cytometry used just you know I

527
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,740
didn't know if you were successful

528
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:14,099
yeah okay it's torture for students sure

529
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,558
well you know we're all students too so

530
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:19,740
sure

531
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:22,139
I thought the ability to quantify the

532
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,419
like degree of Amber Hue of trichomes

533
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,860
was a really interesting development and

534
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,120
uh would go a lot further than me having

535
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:29,038
a zoom call with one of our Growers

536
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,319
saying like well how Amber was it you

537
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,119
know what was that eyeball percentage uh

538
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,639
so I'm curious if you found any

539
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,918
correlation between that and

540
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,059
um concentration of CBD dry matter

541
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,059
development anything like that

542
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,660
they're separate tools we haven't tried

543
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,460
to do any combined analyzes that's a

544
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,740
beautiful question we were much further

545
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,980
along with the nir we can use that very

546
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,960
easily to quantify the 3D animation it

547
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,058
comes and goes with student interest and

548
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,340
the transition to trying to make the 3D

549
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:00,480
mesh is fairly recent so trying to

550
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,918
relate that back to the actual

551
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,000
composition of attractions we haven't

552
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,640
done it yet but you would fully

553
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,500
anticipate it would be as you would

554
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,500
think cool thank you sure

555
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,539
all right

556
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,538
thank you
