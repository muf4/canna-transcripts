hi I'm Kevin mckernon I'm the chief

3
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:12,669
scientific officer of medicinal genomics

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,160
and this year at can med we have some

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:17,649
exciting stuff to talk about we have

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,140
been funded by a cryptocurrency named -

7
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:22,000
who is also sponsoring a conference but

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,350
they also were very interested in

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,320
entering the cannabis market as a

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,670
solution to many of the banking problems

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,219
in the field whether that be raising

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,770
money for for new companies or whether

13
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:34,509
it be solving point-of-sale banking and

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,280
they recognize that the seed to sell

15
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:38,019
tracking system is also a little bit

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,120
disjointed and can probably benefit from

17
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,040
a blockchain so we proposed to them to

18
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,500
sequence a cannabis genome to the best

19
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,909
extent that's ever been done before and

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,649
they liked that idea because it forms a

21
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:50,169
nice foundation for seed to sell

22
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:51,640
tracking and also a good scientific sort

23
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,149
of donation to the field to get their

24
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,980
name well established and and we've now

25
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,899
done that they funded us two months ago

26
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:02,019
and we've been through and we've done

27
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:04,659
about 90 fold coverage of cannabis

28
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,450
genome known as Jamaican lion we picked

29
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:09,579
this strain for a very important reason

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,249
it dates back to 2007 and then what

31
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:14,408
cannabis cup in 2011 and it is a type 2

32
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:16,568
cannabis plant which makes both CBD and

33
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,100
THC and those are a little bit

34
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:19,629
controversial right now based on some

35
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:21,248
recent patents that have issued and so

36
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:23,170
by sequencing this we hope to make a

37
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:26,078
reference genome for the whole world to

38
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,118
use we're gonna put a public and this is

39
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:29,559
going to help people design better tools

40
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:31,810
in the cannabis field because the

41
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,159
current references we have while they

42
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,469
were beneficial for the last few years

43
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,929
the technology today can make them far

44
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:40,178
far better so we'll be presenting on

45
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:41,799
some of that work and all the sequencing

46
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:44,019
we've done with single molecule

47
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,240
sequencing and piecing together this

48
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:48,789
genome into work right now the

49
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,368
assemblies we have are better than the

50
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:53,468
human genome project was when we

51
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:56,498
assembled it for the White House back in

52
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:57,750
2001 when we had a party at the White

53
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:59,939
House over the human

54
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,180
project completion the size of the

55
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,129
context of the human genome we're about

56
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,810
500,000 letters long the average number

57
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,419
of a that's what they call the m50

58
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,580
number so half of the genome rests in

59
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,559
pieces that are larger than 500,000

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,900
letters of time we now have cannabis

61
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,159
genomes that are better than that and we

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,300
think the deserve some celebration as

63
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,490
well and we're going to celebrate those

64
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,650
at Kent met and and show you what those

65
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,990
genomes look like what tools we use to

66
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,849
build those genome references and what

67
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,230
they enable because once you have better

68
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,449
references like this we think it

69
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:33,329
actually hosts it it opens up the door

70
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:36,000
for all types of epigenetic studies we

71
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,410
can now see that THC and CBD synthase

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,699
are actually on the same stretch of

73
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,520
sequence and the third they may be

74
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,619
interacting in some way so that's that's

75
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,090
a really interesting find and it'll

76
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,189
probably also help for people who are

77
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,560
trying to think about RNA interference

78
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:51,359
if you want to do RNA interference to

79
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,939
maybe throw it off pests and other types

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,370
of things playing in cannabis plant you

81
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,349
really have to know your targets the

82
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,780
same thing is true for any CRISPR cast 9

83
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,829
type of work we suspect the RNA

84
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,599
interference stuff will come first

85
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,940
because it's less of a GMO event it's

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,709
more of a way of applying foliar sprays

87
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,079
to modify the expression of the plants

88
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,030
or the pathogens but to do those things

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,280
you really have to have good cannabis

90
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,530
references and we like having them

91
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,019
public as much as they can be so that we

92
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,729
can keep this and open you know an open

93
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,650
form of science for the rest of the

94
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:24,599
community so we're gonna be showcasing a

95
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,219
lot of that can med and we encourage

96
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:34,139
everyone to come thank you

97
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:36,199
[Music]

98
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,199
you
