2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:17,039
all right

3
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:19,140
in in looking at the results and we you

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,720
talked about dosing it seemed like there

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,519
was sort of a sweet spot range for the

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,679
dose that really got the best effect it

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,419
wasn't necessarily the highest dose that

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,640
got the best effect so I was wondering

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,219
if you could speak a bit to that sure I

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,739
mean this is we saw it across both

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,320
studies and Botanical drug extract and

12
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,359
in isolate and Tau model and not towel

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,179
model and then it's uh it's not really

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,799
surprising because we do expect just

15
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,600
about everything at a certain level to

16
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,000
have toxicity

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,460
um and and what we see actually CBG

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,340
appears to be less toxic in this model

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,679
than CBD milligram per milligram

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,460
um but but again you know you can

21
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,960
there's an ld50 for water so as you go

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,920
up eventually something's going to get

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,558
toxic

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,019
but I would also say in terms of

25
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,239
efficacy but this is

26
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:12,118
it's been a theory for some time about

27
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,579
this kind of inverted you or kind of

28
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,379
biphasic effects with cannabinoids I

29
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,298
think they're more profound with THC I

30
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,560
think there's a you know a narrow dose

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,540
window for THC uh we know that you know

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,519
low amounts uh or moderate amounts

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,618
increase appetite they may help with

34
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,079
anxiety they may help with sleep but

35
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:34,500
when you start giving really high doses

36
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,179
of THC you get massive paranoia nausea

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,859
and vomiting I mean it's not pretty

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,020
there are a bunch of hospitalizations

39
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,659
for people that you know didn't know how

40
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,459
much was in their brownie so you you

41
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,560
know as with

42
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,780
um these sorts of of physiological

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,540
effects you may see the same thing in

44
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,618
lifespan taking too much may be a

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,259
hindrance

46
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,599
um or or maybe neutral in terms of being

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,340
a benefit we still don't know kind of

48
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,798
where that sweet spot would be

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,240
especially as it relates to CBD and CBG

50
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,680
in humans

51
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:10,318
okay so can't necessarily apply the

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,060
dosage that was effective in C elegans

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,979
to humans like is there like a

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,719
conversion there that you could take

55
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,899
with in terms of what the dose would be

56
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,340
yeah there is a conversion um it's kind

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,719
of complicated how you do it in C

58
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,580
elegans there's two ways you could

59
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,959
actually look at the exposure you could

60
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,660
spin them down and look at their

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,239
exposure or you could use it as a

62
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,579
correlate with with other compounds that

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,719
have similar

64
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,580
lipophilicity so

65
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,878
um it is complicated but that 40

66
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,680
nanograms per ml or 40 nanograms of 40

67
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,439
micro molar excuse me

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,319
um is is certainly a physiologically

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,060
relevant amount and not the same as you

70
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,458
know if if I was doing work in a dish

71
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,319
right because

72
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:55,319
they're basically eating the medium so

73
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,060
that's concentration in the their food

74
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,699
essentially so

75
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,979
um not necessarily their exposure on the

76
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,859
cell level so when you see you know

77
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,259
cancer studies oftentimes we're applying

78
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,379
that and that would be the cell exposure

79
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:12,780
this is kind of the food exposure which

80
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:15,560
is relevant to their internal exposure

81
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,560
after metabolism

82
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,150
