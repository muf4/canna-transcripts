1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,798
I'm going to spend some time talking

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,679
about um at least assemblies we have

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:10,599
today uh and the where where we're going

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,400
which is uh you know making these Pang

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,599
genomes happen and peeling these things

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,359
apart into diploid genomes as Seth been

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,240
saying and then how we can apply these

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,320
to other medicinal organisms that are

9
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,479
clearly on on many people's radar um

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,518
there we go slide point is working so uh

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,560
we're going to be talking about both uh

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,358
um Cannabis sativa and cilos censis

13
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:31,879
today um and some of the sequencing

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,800
efforts we put to these uh bit of an

15
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,320
outline here is um we're looking at

16
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:38,479
these Pang genome approaches as well uh

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,439
we are also going to be mapping uh more

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,640
of these alumina short sequencing reads

19
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,159
to these Pang genomes because you can

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,878
get a lot done with these things even

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,959
with short reads once you have good

22
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:49,519
references um of course everyone prefers

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,079
to have the longer reads um but if

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,559
you're if you're short on dollars uh the

25
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,120
aluminous stuff can get you many more

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,198
for the same dollar um and you can a lot

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,519
of the genes that are well mapped and

28
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:59,679
understood you can make sense of out of

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,480
these shorter reads uh and then we're

30
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,198
also looking at ways to further reduce

31
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,920
the cost from whole genome sequencing

32
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,000
down to just targeted regions if you if

33
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,960
you follow the history of human genomics

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,680
we went through this period of time

35
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,919
where we were sequencing exomes uh and

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
that that was because it could bring the

37
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,200
cost down to sequencing just the genes

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,880
of interest if you wanted to to survey

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,680
particular regions of the genome for

40
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,879
even lower costs and then if you bring

41
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,720
it one step further um as Seth had shown

42
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,118
as well we were building we've built

43
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,679
snip chips that people can use uh to

44
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,478
survey 85,000 markers in the Cannabis

45
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,600
Gene genome so that you can deploy those

46
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,679
at even further numbers of plants at a

47
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,478
reduced cost and the ultimate like

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,680
reduction of this uh of this approach of

49
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:42,359
surveying less and less is then make PCR

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,320
markers uh that can survey a single or

51
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,799
five loai per per asset Point um so once

52
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,279
we have I want to go over some of these

53
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,840
strain seek uh panels that we've

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,560
recently developed and recently put

55
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,680
public so that uh anybody can order

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,478
these panels and use them at their

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,118
University if they need need be so this

58
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:59,280
becomes a community design panel that

59
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,239
people can use um and then we're also

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,640
going to look at some pathogen response

61
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,078
um uh characteristics in in the cannabis

62
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,118
plant uh and then move over to other

63
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,120
fungi that are very much interested this

64
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:12,959
community such as lby

65
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,800
census okay so um back in before the

66
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,759
pandemic which seems like yesterday

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,439
right uh we put out this Jamaican line

68
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,598
reference as Seth was speaking about uh

69
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,878
this was a thousand times more

70
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,959
contiguous than the short read

71
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,039
assemblies that existed before it uh but

72
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,519
we had to use a technology U from Pac

73
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,318
bio that isn't quite what they have

74
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,759
today it's known as CLR tech technology

75
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,439
which was a continuous long read

76
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,560
technology that could do about 80 KB

77
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,800
reads however the the noise rate in the

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,360
reads alone or they're probably around

79
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,319
90 to 95% accurate so there was a little

80
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,720
bit more error inside of those reads

81
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,518
which can be you know complicate things

82
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,318
when you're dealing with a very

83
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,439
polymorphic plant so as a result we

84
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,560
really hammered this genome with 125x

85
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,680
coverage you don't need to do this

86
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,759
anymore the Hi-Fi Technologies they have

87
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
you can do this in a like 30X coverage

88
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,919
and we'll touch on one of these high-fi

89
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,598
genomes we've done as well uh and the

90
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,039
n50s come out around 3 and a half

91
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:03,560
megabases and so out of reference to the

92
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,158
reference that's currently in um ncbi

93
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,878
that that Seth had had hinted at being

94
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,719
somewhat shuffled we've also seen that

95
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,560
same problem the n50 numbers for that

96
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,680
are around 750 KB uh and they they piece

97
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,280
together those conts with Oxford nanapur

98
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,360
which doesn't do a very good job in

99
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,360
repetitive regions uh it's gets very

100
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,280
very long reads but has very high air

101
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,000
rate and so you can get really confused

102
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,560
in in polymorphic plants piecing

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,479
together the the chromosome numbers the

104
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,438
chromosome numbers in ncbi have

105
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,878
frequently changed uh as a result of us

106
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:32,759
trying to organize this picture as a

107
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,039
community over time uh and some of the

108
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,280
new references that are coming out are

109
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,079
helping to clarify this uh we'll touch

110
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,598
on one of them uh today so this is a a

111
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,120
great paper from her Bogan who went

112
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:43,438
through all of the references that were

113
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,519
available at the time of this

114
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,120
publication and you'll see some of them

115
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,360
that are really old were done only on

116
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,239
alumina and 454 some of those we put out

117
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,319
in 2011 and then they get better over

118
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,200
time as we graduate to these longer and

119
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,158
longer read sequencers uh but what

120
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,560
you're looking at here is a really

121
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,000
important quality score that Seth had

122
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,239
talked had touched on which is called a

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,039
Busco score you scan these genomes for

124
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,640
genes you anticipate every particular

125
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,199
plant should have like we just have a

126
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,839
catalog of these we know that all plants

127
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,000
should have these number of housekeeping

128
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,200
genes and if you're missing some of

129
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,039
those housekeeping genes you probably

130
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,958
don't have a complete reference genome

131
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,599
and of course these databases of Busco

132
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,238
genes are different for every type of

133
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
genus you attack so you go into fungi

134
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:22,599
you got to change your your your Busco

135
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,360
database but what you're looking for is

136
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,160
to have the least amount of green on

137
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,199
this slide which are missing genes this

138
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,720
is the part of the genome that you

139
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,439
failed to sequence because you couldn't

140
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,320
assemble it correctly or it's missing

141
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,399
for for other biological reasons uh the

142
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,279
region that you see in Gray is actually

143
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,679
what that's showing you is that the

144
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,359
sequencers are starting to phase The

145
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
genome that means that they're splitting

146
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,280
apart the maternal and the paternal HLA

147
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,599
group into their own unique conts

148
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,239
because the mother and the father genome

149
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,120
were different enough from a sequencing

150
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,439
standpoint that the assemblers turn

151
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,800
those into their own unique conts uh and

152
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,639
then the Blue Area are all the regions

153
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,840
that have been what what Seth called a

154
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,519
synthetic haid State the mother and the

155
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,319
genome were so similar we just called

156
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,198
one hyic state and uh and we didn't need

157
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,079
to split them apart okay so this is

158
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,800
moving toward phasing these genomes and

159
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,359
it's it's very very important in

160
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,879
cannabis more so than than it is in

161
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,479
human actually okay so what you can see

162
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,719
from those those slides is that the

163
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,439
later the technology you used the more

164
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
complete the reference is it has nothing

165
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,839
to do with this the cultivar that that

166
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,240
we that each of us chose or or how smart

167
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,758
we are it just happens to be with how

168
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,079
late we decided to start sequencing

169
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,120
these things and and what part of law

170
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,399
that we were on uh so we did run

171
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,959
something through Hi-Fi which is what

172
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,399
Seth talked talked about many years ago

173
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,478
and this gave us uh n50s which is the

174
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,159
average size of the contig it inflated

175
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,240
it out to over five megabases and the

176
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,240
Busco scores are getting up at 97% so

177
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,800
that's about as good as you can as close

178
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,680
to finish as you can get without having

179
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,879
to do a 20-year Human Genome Project

180
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,160
finishing uh episode you'll notice the

181
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,839
Human Genome Project recently closed and

182
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,080
finished everything and they did that

183
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,038
really because of these Hi-Fi sequencing

184
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,959
tools um they you know they threw some

185
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,439
high SE and some and some bionano in

186
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,638
there as well but I think the if you ask

187
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,160
those researchers what was the number

188
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,560
one thing that really changed and closed

189
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,960
the human genome they would tell you

190
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,478
it's the high-fi sequencing chemistry

191
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,598
that that really um made that happen um

192
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:17,439
so you can take these um sequences we

193
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,079
have and align them to cs10 which is a

194
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,839
type three plant Jamaican lines a type

195
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,519
two plant and you can see there's not

196
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,478
100% agreement there's some crossover

197
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,918
here between all of the uh the different

198
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,318
homologies and uh those differences at

199
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,959
the time we didn't really understand

200
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,960
where those true biological differences

201
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,359
between the plants or were these

202
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,239
assembly artifacts I think we're

203
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,280
beginning to appreciate that they may in

204
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
fact be assembly artifacts uh as more

205
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,239
and more um other people publish these

206
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,839
same

207
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,199
observations the other thing that you

208
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,959
can see with Hi-Fi is you can see the

209
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,560
length of telr now now this is something

210
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:48,198
that I was really cool because I have

211
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,360
never seen 40kb telr sequences before in

212
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,160
my life and I've been sequencing since

213
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,120
1996 uh but out poo these telr with

214
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,000
really not a whole lot of effort you can

215
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,840
see they do vary based on chromosome you

216
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,879
know they're they're quite different uh

217
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,719
in length some are a couple KB some are

218
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,360
40 KB I bet this is a bit limited there

219
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,599
could be some in there that are 60 KB

220
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,160
but we didn't really have the read

221
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,038
length and high-fi to be able to resolve

222
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,280
them at at that at that point but this

223
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,598
is something to think about with with

224
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,839
cannabis sence and to think about with

225
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,120
um cloning age if you hyper clone things

226
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,638
over time the telr likely shrink like

227
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,360
they do in in Maman genomes and this may

228
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,879
give you a sense of of like a molecular

229
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,759
clock on the

230
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,680
plant okay so we did some work with

231
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,639
organ CBD and urfin as well where we

232
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,439
ended up doing a a lot of um genotyping

233
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,879
across a an F1 population in Jamaican

234
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,800
lion and that helped us build these

235
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,879
linkage mths so um you can estimate you

236
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,360
know the the the actual genetic distance

237
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,080
between two different markers in a

238
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,800
genome uh is a proxy for how how close

239
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,399
they we combine but really the devil's

240
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,879
in the biology you have to actually go

241
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,000
and do the crosses and then you see how

242
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,759
frequently these things actually

243
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
recombine in biology because the genes

244
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,479
at the end of the chromosomes have a

245
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,279
tendency to cross over more frequently

246
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,359
than the ones in the Cent and so these

247
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,318
linkage maps are important to calibrate

248
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,879
How likely is it that a gene will be

249
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,919
co-inherited with another one you can't

250
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,639
just use a meab base scale on this you

251
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,598
have to kind of convert it to senorans

252
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,120
and this project helped us do that and

253
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,719
these categories and buckets that you

254
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,158
see in here in color are the concordance

255
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,919
that we have with the high sea assembled

256
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:20,199
version of this genome this is um

257
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,959
similar to the dovetail work that Seth

258
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,038
was uh was demonstrating this is a

259
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,158
chromatin capture technique that buckets

260
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:27,680
chromosomes into the proper place when

261
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:29,719
you when you start with a collection of

262
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,959
hundreds to thousands of conics so we've

263
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,440
got a nice understanding of that thanks

264
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,879
to some of that work uh we have um have

265
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,560
a few folks in Massachusetts that have

266
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,000
gone and tissue culture this so yes

267
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,639
Jamaican line can be tisue culture

268
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,679
there's nothing weird about it uh we've

269
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,319
built snipper Rays off of this reference

270
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,639
uh and we've also built um some of these

271
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,959
mini exom tools and I look forward to if

272
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,439
if better references come out the next

273
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,719
year that are perfectly phased across

274
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,279
100 genomes it'll be a boom to the

275
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,080
industry and we'll readily adopt them

276
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,320
because uh this is a it's a real

277
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,680
challenging problem to work on

278
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,000
references that um that are dated in any

279
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:02,078
way okay so we we have taken then uh a

280
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,360
an approach here of taking aluminous

281
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:05,278
shotgun sequencing because it's more

282
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,919
affordable to to blast through another

283
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,320
40 genomes and map it to these

284
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,439
references and this is in a this is in a

285
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,480
pre-print right now form that's up in

286
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,920
bioarchive um and what you can gauge

287
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,839
from here is the type of variation that

288
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,838
you see amongst all these genomes all

289
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,200
right this is more variation than we've

290
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,680
see in human genomes and human genomes

291
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,399
are much bigger so it's so there's about

292
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,000
a a variance every probably 50 bases

293
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,320
between the hemp lines and maybe every

294
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,759
90 bases between the type one lines when

295
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,519
you compare them to the Jamaican line

296
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,919
reference and if you get into the

297
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,600
chromosome this thing jumps to like a

298
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,639
varant every 25 bases the white

299
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,440
chromosome is much more polymorphic and

300
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,759
it's the largest chromosome out there

301
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,079
there's flowering genes on there there's

302
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,958
a host of things in the Y chromosome

303
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,278
that we that we have to pay attention to

304
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,958
the indels are the insertions and

305
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:45,958
deletions and just beware the the other

306
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:49,000
axes up there that you're looking at uh

307
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,879
is the indel oh missed that well we're

308
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,919
not going to go back I'll tell you about

309
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,240
indel later um so the the two different

310
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,278
axes there one is Snips and one is

311
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,879
zindel and there's you know 10 to 15

312
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:59,480
million variants from a single

313
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,720
nucleotide level and there's millions of

314
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,720
them from an insertion and deletion

315
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,120
standpoint and when you get into

316
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,079
structural variations the numbers go

317
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,039
down um from there substantially but

318
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:07,879
there's still a large portion of the

319
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,319
genome that is in structural variation

320
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:10,600
the most obvious thing in cannabis

321
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,959
genetics right now is what known as the

322
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,320
btbd Alo that Etsy and deayer originally

323
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,078
described but didn't know the genetic

324
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
location of uh that's been fully

325
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,319
resolved now and I probably argue that

326
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,959
maybe 90 other than some of the Exotic

327
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,879
stuff that Seth has in his Library most

328
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,319
of the cannabis genetics out there the

329
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,480
THC and CBD ratios are governed by this

330
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,320
we're going to touch on some of the rare

331
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,800
things that they found as well that can

332
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,560
can be an exception to this rule but

333
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,120
basically the presence of or absence of

334
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:38,000
CBD or THC synthes dictates the

335
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,799
chemotype of the plant with the

336
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,679
exception that he mentioned from zerel

337
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:45,078
which is that if you clone these genes

338
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,039
into yeast they make a portfolio of

339
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,319
canabo uh even though they're supposed

340
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,480
to be dedicated to making one so CBD

341
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,560
synthes makes like a 21 or 25 to1 ratio

342
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,519
and can leak some THD synthes so we have

343
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,000
we have to be careful about that uh we

344
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,039
also have to be aware of the fact that

345
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,440
there are many other canab oid synthes

346
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,599
genes in the genome and we don't know

347
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
how much those leak yet um but we're

348
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,720
presuming they probably leak and they

349
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,879
probably aren't specific to making a

350
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,759
single cannaboid uh they probably make

351
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,240
predominantly one canabo by orders of

352
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,519
magnitude but they probably leak other

353
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,039
ones as well so this heat map here is a

354
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,759
list of the did I get that right no I

355
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,759
think that's backwards that's forward

356
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,039
well I don't know how to make the laser

357
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,319
por go on this but uh what you're seeing

358
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,919
on the right hand axis there are the

359
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,399
cannaboid synas genes and you're seeing

360
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,399
the presence of absence of those in red

361
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,919
and blue the Jamaican line references

362
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,799
are over on the right and you get this

363
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,958
kind of light blue color because they

364
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,599
all have those

365
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,679
genes what you're seeing in the red and

366
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,120
blue are The Disappearance of certain

367
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,319
genes um or the or the inclusion of them

368
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,240
and what Seth had mentioned uh what we

369
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,680
had found a few years ago is there is a

370
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,720
very large deletion that covers the

371
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,159
canab chroman synthes genes uh there's

372
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,278
there's many of these genes in the

373
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,278
Jamaican line reference but when the

374
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,919
deletion occurs it takes out some

375
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,000
neighboring genes with it and these

376
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,799
neighboring genes are known to be

377
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,879
associated with pathogen response resp

378
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:04,039
now one approach to breeding perhaps low

379
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:05,838
THC plants a really clever way is

380
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,519
bringing in the Varin another way is

381
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,920
maybe breed plants that have less of

382
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,600
these other canabo genes so that you

383
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,838
don't you you don't risk the leakage

384
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,959
from these synthes genes leaking other

385
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,519
canabo potentially THC in your process

386
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,838
so some people are breeding to get rid

387
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,278
of the canab chromi cassette and that

388
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,839
it's possible this can back you into a

389
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,879
corner and that it takes out some

390
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,600
pathogen response genes now down the

391
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,360
lower area in yellow on this uh on this

392
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,879
map uh you can see that there's kind of

393
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,159
a scattering down there that means

394
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,320
that's the part of the deletion that

395
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:37,719
isn't consistent plant to plant and some

396
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,560
have variable lengths in this deletion

397
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,480
which means some some deletions of CBC

398
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,198
synthes can occur that don't knock out

399
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,800
these genes so you got to be careful

400
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:48,078
when you go about um trying to knock

401
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,958
these things out you can also extend

402
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,838
this to pathogen uh response genes on

403
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:55,559
the right there's another list of

404
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,600
kinases thotin like proteins and um an

405
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,759
MLL loide that are in here these are

406
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,120
things that are published in hops to

407
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:03,000
have a big Ro well we also had done some

408
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,959
isos sequencing in this that's RNA

409
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,240
sequencing with P bile what that had

410
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,439
demonstrated is the most highly

411
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
expressed Gene in the genome were kites

412
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,320
these are things that dissolve fungal

413
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,639
coats and fight off pathogens what we

414
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,000
noticed in some work from Colorado seeds

415
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,120
is they had a copy number amplification

416
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,639
of some of these pathogen response genes

417
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,360
one was a kenas and one was a thotin

418
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,440
like protein so we took those genes we

419
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,120
cloned them and we started running beta

420
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,639
glucanase assay to look for how

421
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,839
effective were these genes uh after we

422
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,560
express them in ecoli uh did they still

423
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,920
work and would they actually attack

424
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,838
glucan uh and so we we ran some essays

425
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,759
that showed that yes the Cannabis cloned

426
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,959
enzymes do in fact attack these glucans

427
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,159
uh and then we started putting them down

428
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,078
on Petri dishes on these tabs of paper

429
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,639
to see if it would [ __ ] or change the

430
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:50,758
growth of of various fungi that are

431
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,680
known to infect cannabis so you can see

432
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,560
a penicilium species there a fusarium

433
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,319
species there and we can in fact put

434
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,039
these enzymes down and they slow the

435
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,959
growth of these pathogens that are known

436
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,639
to affect cannabis now this sounds like

437
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,039
a great tool to spray on Plants but you

438
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,320
know the hydrogen peroxide is pretty

439
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,559
cheap enzymes like this even though

440
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,399
they're cloned in a coli are very

441
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,879
expensive we decided they're may be a

442
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,078
better tool for this that fit into our

443
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,159
pipeline is can we use these in our

444
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:15,239
pathogen detection tools to actually do

445
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,198
a better job of cracking open yeast and

446
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,240
mold so that our tests don't miss any of

447
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,719
those things um so here's an experiment

448
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,399
we did where we just put these enzymes

449
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,720
after they were cloned out of the out of

450
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,839
the Jamaican line genome into eoli

451
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,720
expressed those enzymes put them into

452
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,839
broth and then spiked various different

453
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,360
amounts of fungi in there to see if

454
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,480
these enzymes would actually liberate

455
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,919
more of the DNA or whether they would

456
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,000
kill some of these organisms and we can

457
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:41,078
in fact see a massive shift in the

458
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,839
quantitative PCR results when we have

459
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:44,879
these enzymes present that tells us that

460
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,399
we're actually doing a better job at

461
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,759
retarding the growth of these particular

462
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,759
fungi um this was done actually with ASP

463
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,278
regillus and we're getting a four to 6

464
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,600
fourfold reduction in the amount of ASP

465
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:55,480
regillus that grows in a given time

466
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,920
period when these enzymes are present so

467
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,278
these have now made their way into our

468
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,519
kits they've been in the field for a

469
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:03,278
while now um our new path pathos

470
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,759
products actually have this enzymatic

471
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,360
Lis involved or at least a derivative of

472
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,560
this enzyme involved that helps U crack

473
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,360
open these G so we get a better job at

474
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,879
actually surveying the pathogens when

475
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,919
we're trying to make safety tests for

476
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,198
the pathogen field um ion's going to

477
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,078
speak about this a little bit more

478
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,679
tomorrow but these kits have now made

479
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,198
their way through aoac at least the

480
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,439
aspergillis four different aspila

481
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:25,639
species are through salmonella a STC

482
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,120
we're just in the process of moving

483
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,240
total yeast and mold and total aerobic

484
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,519
count through but um there's a lot of

485
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,839
complexity to actually doing this

486
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,198
correctly which she's going to touch on

487
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,959
tomorrow but yes there are genes in the

488
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:37,958
cannabis plant that have basically given

489
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,638
us some wisdom on how to better survey

490
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:42,479
the fungi that might in fact infect it

491
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,079
which is um which is quite cool okay so

492
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,639
um what can we do from all the

493
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,479
sequencing here if we're going to build

494
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,278
a panel to focus on sequencing certain

495
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,199
genes uh which are the ones that

496
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:51,958
probably matter the most to the

497
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:53,439
community so we put in the cannaboid

498
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,559
synthes genes we put in the turpine

499
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,240
synthes genes we put in the flavonoid

500
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,679
genes the kitase thotin like proteins

501
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,879
the the MLL genes um a lot of the other

502
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,799
genes in the genome that have been

503
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:06,278
annotated as being pathogen resistance

504
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,120
on Jamaican line um and then we also put

505
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,159
in some flowering genes from both the X

506
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,679
and the Y lots of markers across the y

507
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,559
and some random ones distributed across

508
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,958
the genome so that the snip chips and

509
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,078
that the sequencing tools that try to

510
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,638
Target these things for lower costs are

511
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:20,838
actually um targeting some genes of

512
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,720
really really high interest um this is

513
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,079
now a community design panel anyone can

514
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,199
order it and use it at their local

515
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,039
University you don't have necessarily

516
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,479
sequence with us you can just get the

517
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,360
the kit yourself um but you can use the

518
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,278
software as well so this is a public

519
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,919
software service on canopia you can

520
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,439
import your samples here if you'd like

521
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:38,198
and it will'll analyze it according to

522
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,399
the uh this thing is even higher than

523
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,359
16005 as of today but these are all the

524
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,559
genomes that are currently in there it

525
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,959
will give you an estimate of how how

526
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,879
rare this genome is compared to

527
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,799
everything that's in the database um it

528
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,958
will also walk you through how much X

529
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,278
toy sequencing we see this might be

530
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,439
pertinent when we start looking at

531
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,198
hermaphroditic traits right now there

532
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,079
isn't a real clear signal as to what

533
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,399
genes drive this so we've decided that

534
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:02,239
we're just going to monitor how much the

535
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,038
reads come out of these systems that

536
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,160
match the x or the Y and maybe some

537
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:08,519
patterns will merge out of out of

538
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,959
understanding this and then we also go

539
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,279
over those genes in the btbd Alo that

540
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,600
Etsy and de described uh is that we want

541
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,000
to look at the coverage of these genes

542
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,639
and the presence of absence of these

543
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
genes gives us a really good predictive

544
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,240
model as to whether you're going to be a

545
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,119
type 1 two 3 four or five plant we can

546
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,679
gauge that all from the sequencing alone

547
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,639
with some minor exceptions that we're

548
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,880
going to touch on here um this is

549
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,360
something that um we frequently had

550
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,679
customers come to us saying you we

551
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,079
sequenced with you and it's a CBG plant

552
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,840
and you called it a type 1 plant what

553
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,480
the hell's wrong and we dig into it

554
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,079
invariably we find this variant um so by

555
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,440
the time this happened like the eth or

556
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,720
ninth time to us I decided to write a

557
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,360
white paper about it to explain to

558
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,360
everyone why this variant matters and

559
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:48,439
when I put it up on on the portal I

560
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:49,599
noticed uh from Seth maybe a week later

561
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,080
that they had already published about

562
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,199
this a week a month earlier in the

563
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,119
pandemic and I missed the paper um but

564
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,640
they also find that this variant is in

565
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,879
fact uh attenuating THC synthes it's

566
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,600
amazing because it's a single variant

567
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,360
that seems to be driving this we've

568
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,719
happened to find this variant is always

569
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,399
in um concordance or in I should say in

570
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,000
linkage with another variant known as P3

571
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,240
through3 R which itself doesn't seem to

572
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,558
have any dysfunctional activity on the

573
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,400
on the enzyme but this is a location in

574
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,879
the genome that zerel had tagged as

575
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,159
being really critical to the

576
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,880
glycosilation of this THC synthes enzyme

577
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,280
uh and so it's very likely that the

578
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,720
damaging is because it's adding a

579
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,918
glycosilation site to the THC synthese

580
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,919
and that's probably making it a

581
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,840
dysfunctional version of it so you can a

582
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,440
copy of THC synthes in rare cases that

583
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,319
some of these type four plants have and

584
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,640
it's completely oblad by having one of

585
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,200
these these polymorphisms so simple copy

586
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,480
number analysis may miss this and you

587
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,240
need to get some SS in there um these

588
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,880
are the eight different strains that um

589
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,400
that kind of haunted us about this uh

590
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,679
that we had sequenc over time that have

591
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,440
this same variant and I think one of the

592
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,440
more interesting ones is Doug's varen

593
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,558
because Doug's varen was actually a a

594
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,480
thcv line so it did make some THC and it

595
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,399
made it as thcv but a little bit more in

596
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,000
THC so what is it doing well turned out

597
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,080
it's it's actually heterozygous for this

598
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,400
variant it's got one copy of THC synthes

599
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:06,839
that works it's got one that's broken

600
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,480
and if you look at the chemotype of this

601
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,959
it also has half the amount of the

602
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,440
canapino is actually CBG so there's a

603
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,000
bottleneck and synthesis here when one

604
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,159
of the genes is knocked out we can't

605
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,119
convert all the CBG into THC so we get a

606
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,720
buildup of CBG and we get a little bit

607
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,199
of THC and thcv as well very interesting

608
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,400
um so as I mentioned before the platform

609
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,120
will give you some uh heredity

610
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,159
information in terms of what else these

611
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:29,239
things are related to if it's common if

612
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,280
it's uncommon

613
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,798
it's rare um the snip chips are now

614
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,480
integrated as well so if you run snip

615
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,000
chips with urfin we can Port that data

616
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,279
in and we can still call the copy number

617
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,679
variant off of snip chips because

618
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,399
there's enough variance in these genes

619
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,400
that we just hyper tile those genes and

620
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,360
watch how many of the assays drop out

621
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,720
and it can give us an information about

622
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,798
whether it's CBD dominant THD dominant

623
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,798
and even whether it's male or female as

624
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:53,400
well um so there's a bunch of different

625
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,440
tools you can use here um you know the

626
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,320
best is obviously whole genome

627
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,840
sequencing the absolute Pinnacle so what

628
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,599
you're seeing Seth do is doing high-fi

629
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,639
sequencing and building reference it's

630
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,279
more expensive more time intensive and

631
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,038
you need very good high molecular weight

632
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,279
DNA you don't always get that out of a

633
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,640
hole punch from a plant however you can

634
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,200
get a variety of these things from like

635
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,520
a whole punch of a plant very small

636
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,159
amount of DNA can be used for these

637
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,720
short read sequencers uh and uh you know

638
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,960
there's varying degrees of resolution

639
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,079
here there's whole genum shotgun with

640
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,840
alumina there's doing this 18 megabase

641
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,119
panel with alumina it's 10 to 18

642
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,199
depending on how deep you go and there's

643
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,439
an 85k snip chip that you can use

644
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,679
varying degrees of information that you

645
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,279
can pull off of this and they all

646
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,720
integrate well with this canopia tool

647
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,759
um so what else can you do with this

648
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,679
well once you have a really good

649
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,558
reference you know what your pathogens

650
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,880
are uh and that's very important when

651
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:38,678
you're looking for viruses because often

652
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,039
time viruses just look like retroviral

653
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:41,360
elements and genomes so you want to have

654
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,879
a really good reference so that things

655
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,240
that don't map to that reference you can

656
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,799
then go categorize and say okay what do

657
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,279
these things look like um this was

658
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,000
actually done really elegantly by the

659
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,798
group at phos and darkheart they went

660
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,200
and actually did RNA sequencing and they

661
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:55,200
were able to assemble those things and

662
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,919
find new viruses and it's sometimes it's

663
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,279
very helpful to first map all your reads

664
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,360
against the references to pull out the

665
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,158
things that are that are you know that

666
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,519
are related to the plant so you can play

667
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,400
with the things that are clearly not

668
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,639
from the plant so we've gone and built

669
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,000
lots of um virus tools there's a list of

670
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,880
them up there um we have released these

671
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,240
five ones so far and the other ones are

672
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,760
all made and the reason we haven't

673
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,240
released them is we've not found

674
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,200
molecular evidence for them yet in the

675
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,278
plant other than tobacco streak virus

676
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,480
that was just published out of Colorado

677
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:26,480
however it published it was only 83%

678
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,798
identical to to what was found on

679
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,440
Tobacco so one of the lessons here is

680
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,359
that even though these things share

681
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,120
names from other plants often times when

682
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,079
you find the virus in cannabis it's so

683
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:39,359
significantly deserve diverged it

684
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,639
probably deserves a new name uh and uh

685
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,079
that's some of the problems we have is

686
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,278
in releasing these assays we don't want

687
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,399
to release them until we we actually see

688
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:47,759
the DNA sequence evidence of the virus

689
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,120
that's on the plant so we know that our

690
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,919
primers actually hit them uh we have all

691
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,678
these working on positive controls we

692
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,120
have not found evidence of them in in in

693
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,400
cannabis when you look at the ones that

694
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,918
are on the pipeline side the ones in the

695
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,519
left we actually have some evidence of

696
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,520
them being in cannabis and I'll show you

697
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:05,599
some examples of this working really

698
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,879
well so we work with a few grows across

699
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,480
the country um some that were suffering

700
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,960
from Hop and virid some that were

701
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,159
suffering from lettuce chlorosis virus

702
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,679
and one that was actually suffering from

703
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,679
both and they were quickly able to scan

704
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:18,159
their mother plants identify the plants

705
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,480
that actually had these viruses and

706
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,679
viroids call them and move and get their

707
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,679
grows back to a particular place of of

708
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,038
productivity this worked very well and

709
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,600
very quickly for them however we did

710
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,359
learn a couple lessons in these things

711
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,119
um here's some other pictures of lcv

712
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,558
that was making a Real mess of some of

713
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,158
these grows one lesson you learned is

714
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,079
that the phenotype isn't always evidence

715
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,000
right when you have one of these

716
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,319
diseases it doesn't manifest in like a

717
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,240
clean like that's an obvious hlv and

718
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:46,359
that's an obvious lcv the these these

719
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,720
things sometimes have PL pleotropic um

720
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:50,639
conditions and they can each one each

721
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,079
disease can look like one another so the

722
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,360
the visual confirmation doesn't

723
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,480
necessarily tell you what it is um the

724
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,000
other thing that we noticed uh in this

725
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,278
chart here what you're looking at in

726
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,759
blue are hopl en vroid um assays that

727
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:04,400
were run across 12 different mother

728
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:06,079
plants heirloom mother plants from Colin

729
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,080
Palmer that were like 30 years old he

730
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,960
did not want to get rid of these things

731
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,439
uh but one Trend you'll see is that when

732
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,360
the plants are actually infected with

733
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,278
hop PL and VI they're screaming hot with

734
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,158
CTS in the 20s uh I would not advise

735
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:21,038
people to be culling really important

736
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,080
mother plants with very late CTS because

737
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,720
those could be noise from PCR they could

738
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,439
be contamination or there could be

739
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,919
something very interesting biologically

740
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,558
that when you have something that's

741
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,120
100,000 fold lower thyroid content you

742
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,519
might be stumbling across a plant that

743
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,759
actually has some form of resistance

744
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,679
that you want to like put aside and

745
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:38,759
maybe study a little bit we don't want

746
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,559
to have happen in the industry is

747
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,960
aggressive use of PCR and people start

748
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,359
weeding out all their mother plants and

749
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,840
suddenly the genetic diversity is just

750
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,558
imploded um so the CT values are really

751
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,678
important right now for us to monitor

752
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:52,839
these and understand what we're looking

753
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,200
at from a from a viroid load level uh

754
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,000
the other thing to do is to sample more

755
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,480
than once um okay when we did this with

756
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,240
Colin since these plants were some of

757
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,278
the original like early chem dog and

758
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,720
sour d lines is we said all right we're

759
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:03,960
going to sequ we're we're going to PCR

760
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,600
this thing in triplicate we're going to

761
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,360
do it every 3 days and we're going to do

762
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,199
that for three weeks so we're confident

763
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,399
that we know this mother plant is toast

764
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,960
and there's nothing we can do other than

765
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,519
maybe go to a tissue culture lab and

766
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,200
sort it out if you're dealing with

767
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,679
clones this is this is overkill maybe

768
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,080
clones are disposable just kill them you

769
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,038
know but uh if you're dealing with a

770
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,839
really important heirloom mother plant

771
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:23,640
i' I'd encourage you to to to put a lot

772
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,359
of effort into making sure the thing is

773
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,840
in fact infected and it's not something

774
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,519
that's uh that's a fluke um now what was

775
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,918
interesting about the study is we found

776
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:33,599
this and we surveyed The Roots the

777
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,679
leaves the penales everything the viroid

778
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,599
is everywhere okay it's in the roots and

779
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,960
there's probably some evidence I'm going

780
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,079
to gamble on this and say that I think

781
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,278
we're going to find that these things

782
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,918
are moving through the fungal melium

783
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,119
Network because there is evidence of

784
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,720
viroids moving hop streak virus in

785
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:52,038
particular moving in melium uh in in in

786
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,440
in other plants so uh we have to pay

787
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:55,158
attention this might not just be about

788
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,519
cleaning scissors uh if you got plants

789
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,159
that are in the same root beds be

790
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,599
careful there may be a mechanism for

791
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,679
these viroids to actually communicate

792
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,038
through the fungal melium Network um now

793
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:05,360
we are also putting in some tools

794
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,398
there's a there's a there's a group here

795
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,439
eugent that has uh some of this running

796
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:10,599
outside in the exhibit hall um that's

797
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,840
going to help us with autoc calling

798
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,079
these PCR tools okay when a lot of the

799
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,240
labs that are running pathos seek are

800
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,918
running lots of these samples and it's a

801
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,440
little bit cumbersome to have people go

802
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,600
through all of the CT scores and score

803
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,558
them manually so this is an AI system

804
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:25,359
that was really honed over the

805
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:26,558
coronavirus pandemic uh where they've

806
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,959
gone through millions and millions of

807
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,720
samples and they can readily call these

808
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,440
curves automatically in flag which ones

809
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,200
are truly failing which ones have the

810
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,600
internal controls functioning it's very

811
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,319
important uh and which ones uh need to

812
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,398
be rerun so this will help automate a

813
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,480
lot of the work that's out there um take

814
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:42,879
a take a peek at it over there in the

815
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,759
booth um now where else can we apply

816
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,960
this well um during the pandemic um a

817
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,079
lot I don't know if people filed this

818
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,159
but there's a lot of interesting work on

819
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,359
a compound known as fluvoxamine

820
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,399
fluvoxamine is an SSRI but it's a very

821
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:57,439
interesting SSRI that has uh Sigma one

822
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:59,798
receptor activity um somewhat unique in

823
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,558
that regard if any of you follow the DMT

824
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:03,398
space you know that DMT also hits a

825
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,038
sigma 1 receptor and it's also is a

826
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:07,839
serotonin my mimic right so many people

827
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:09,558
think psilocin can replace some of these

828
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,519
ssris in fact that's been published in

829
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:13,079
the New England Journal of Medicine so

830
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,000
we got interested in sequencing this

831
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,319
thing um because it also has been shown

832
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,200
to play some interesting roles in um in

833
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:21,119
treatment resistant depression and in

834
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,840
cancer terminal cancer depression so a

835
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,079
wonderful presentation today out about

836
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,720
using this in breast cancer so we called

837
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,720
out Seth and said hey can you do you

838
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,360
have any spare space on your pack bio

839
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,000
all of the universities in Co seem to be

840
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,479
shut down and they can't get us an

841
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,720
accurate turnaround time and using the

842
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,919
pack bio uh so we sent him some high

843
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,960
molecular weight DNA he fitted on in in

844
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,240
one of the holes in one of his

845
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,480
sequencers while he was doing hundreds

846
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,720
of other cannabis genomes and out popped

847
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,440
this genome in remarkable shape after

848
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,440
just being on a fraction of one of his

849
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,120
flow cells uh and it was actually

850
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,679
remarkable the high-fi sequencing on

851
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,479
this had three of the chromosomes come

852
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,159
out tip to tip without needing to touch

853
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,919
them at all that has never happened in

854
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,919
my life in genomics uh there's always

855
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,399
been an eyeball a human eyeball has had

856
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,600
to take care of a lot of the repeat

857
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:04,319
structures in any fungal genome so it's

858
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:05,879
now in 13 chromosomes after we put some

859
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,639
of this High SE data on it from phas

860
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,039
genomics so we've got a really good

861
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,000
annotator reference now it's been

862
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:13,278
published it's an ncbi it's open source

863
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,159
for anyone to use um and we're now

864
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,640
beginning to tease apart um the

865
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:18,520
completeness of the genome and some of

866
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,360
the pathways that are in there uh and

867
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,079
the one pathway I want to turn your

868
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,479
attention to oh you'll see the Busco

869
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,599
scores are up there in the n50s those

870
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,440
are all really important to understand

871
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,240
the completeness but there's um I think

872
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,880
the best analogy here is CBG and the

873
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,880
cannabinoids you know CBG is the mother

874
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,520
cannabinoid and then it gets split apart

875
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,159
by other enzymes they fight over it to

876
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,720
decide what to make I think there's a

877
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,039
similar thing going on in sosy and that

878
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,360
El tropin is like the CBG analog and it

879
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,480
either makes these tryptamines that are

880
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:48,639
psychoactive like psilocybin and soloin

881
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,278
origin biocytin nor biocytin or it makes

882
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,880
these beta carbolines which are

883
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:54,038
monoamino oxidase Inhibitors that can

884
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,080
impact the actual metabolism of the

885
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:57,720
actual psychoactive compounds and some

886
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,359
of the beta carbines are psychoactive

887
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,360
themselves the beta carbolines are

888
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,158
predominately made in the mycelium and

889
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,678
the uh psilocybin is predominately made

890
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:07,640
in the carpa fores um so this pathway

891
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,840
was identified by many people before us

892
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,200
uh Frick at all and and blly at all had

893
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,639
done a lot of work on this uh looking at

894
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,960
this cassette now it turns out most of

895
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,880
the genes responsible for this in in

896
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,960
csop cubensis are are clustered in a

897
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,159
20kb cassette that some people even

898
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,240
cloned into Brewer sheet to try and have

899
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,080
beer that makes um psilocin which should

900
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,720
be fun um but what you can do when you

901
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:30,439
have sequence like this we now have uh

902
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,120
84 of these genomes I think there's

903
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,120
another 16 coming off machines right now

904
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,798
um and uh what you can do is look at

905
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,639
those pathway genes this here is the

906
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,079
psim M gene this is the gene that

907
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,519
methylates the um the tryptamine or the

908
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,398
tryptophan okay and what the map that

909
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,359
you're looking at over there are is a

910
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:50,239
snip eff map that looks at the how

911
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,119
damaging the mutation is and color codes

912
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,640
it according to how damaging it is the

913
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:55,479
really bright green ones are frame shift

914
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,240
mutations those are really bad the red

915
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,038
ones are likely moderate mutations that

916
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,960
you should pay attention too and the

917
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,640
green ones are amino acid M mutations

918
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,440
but they're not a very high eff score

919
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,840
anything that's blue is identical to the

920
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,840
reference sequence um so you can see in

921
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:10,558
here that the reference genome that we

922
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:12,278
picked which embarrassingly is named

923
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,558
penis envy so if you think the Cannabis

924
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:16,679
names are bad wait till you get into the

925
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:19,720
mushrooms face um but you'll see that it

926
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,640
has a difference in this PSI M gene uh

927
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,798
and maybe that's material to why it is

928
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,120
known to make a lot more psilocybin than

929
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,278
many of the other mushrooms it's known

930
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:29,839
to be one of the more potent ones um we

931
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:32,079
have now a nice philogenetic tree of

932
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,359
this and of course we can readily take

933
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,439
um a dissection into this and start

934
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,359
looking at mating types uh we we know

935
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,399
about X and Y mating types that's very

936
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,719
interesting it's very similar to mammals

937
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,439
when you get into fungi things get much

938
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,120
more blurred okay we now have these kind

939
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,440
of spectrums of genders that go on known

940
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,798
as isomorphs okay you in this case we

941
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,159
think this is tetrapolar and that's

942
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:51,599
there's four different genders there

943
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,600
might be six we're still trying to sort

944
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,398
that out um but this is just a picture

945
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,158
of what some of those mating types look

946
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:59,239
like now what are the mating types and

947
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,880
what govern them um they're governed by

948
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,079
pheromones and colonies on plates will

949
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,320
not grow into one another if they're

950
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,720
wrong mating type and they won't form

951
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,398
clamp connections and they won't share

952
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,880
nuclei when this happens uh and so we're

953
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,678
now just trying to dissect these mating

954
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,640
types I'm we show in time to dig into

955
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,120
that so we have a canopia fork of this

956
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,559
now that does the same thing it looks at

957
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,759
coverage maps over the key genes that

958
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:19,599
are in the pathway it tells you how

959
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,879
related you are to everything else but

960
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,079
more importantly um you can dig into

961
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,480
each variant in pull up an igv as well

962
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,798
but more importantly it also digs into

963
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,519
the microbiome and I want to share a

964
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,639
story with you this last minute about

965
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,159
why this became very important to us uh

966
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,559
the microbiome of these things is

967
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,960
important in growing because you can't

968
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:36,480
have bacteria around because it grows

969
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,159
too fast in these things and the fungi

970
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,159
grows slower so you want very sterile

971
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,000
growth um when you have these genomes

972
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,640
you can build PCR assays that do look

973
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,240
for the the contamination so this is

974
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,840
psim and PSI K being PCR looking for

975
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,720
total aerobic count or eoli background

976
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:55,319
um genomic information that may that may

977
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,200
be contaminating the grow so last few

978
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,918
seconds someone sent us um DNA from this

979
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,679
this is this thing grew in 16 days is a

980
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,679
monster mushroom okay USA mology had

981
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,480
this uh we went sequencing about it and

982
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,919
one thing that popped out um are some

983
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,759
genes that are involved in making

984
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:15,399
massive mushrooms it turns out cilos in

985
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,919
fact has this Gene uh it's on a radar

986
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:18,239
and there's very little diversity in it

987
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,360
with the exception of what we're seeing

988
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,880
up there in this monster mushroom this

989
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:26,158
bm16 happens to have something weird

990
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,360
going on inside this Gene now um what is

991
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,840
it well we see multiple different copies

992
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:33,479
of this type of Gene it's called FV

993
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:34,918
cpc2 um we don't yet know if this is

994
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,599
what is driving it but if you look

995
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,440
through all the other versions of this

996
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,519
Gene in pilia uh what you find is that

997
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,159
there are three dominant forms of this

998
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,759
Gene we have 77 of the strains have one

999
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:48,760
version of the gene five of the ones

1000
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:50,359
that are outside of cubensis have a

1001
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:53,599
different version of the Gene and then

1002
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:55,278
the zeren PS in orisa India have a third

1003
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,918
version of this Gene and the fourth

1004
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,440
version of this Gene is unique to bm16

1005
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,559
but that we think is too good to be true

1006
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,000
um that usually tells us we could have a

1007
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,398
contamination and it could be part of

1008
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,398
the microbiome and that's what we have

1009
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,158
to do some work to resolve these

1010
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:11,038
microbiome plots show us that when we

1011
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,559
sequence this from spores something else

1012
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,119
was in there uh and we can notice that

1013
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:17,879
from um these these uh blob tools plots

1014
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:19,278
so we're doing more sequencing on this

1015
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,039
now to see if this is real or whether

1016
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,079
it's a contamination stay tuned but the

1017
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:25,398
lesson of this is uh genomics is a very

1018
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,119
powerful tool you can sort a lot of

1019
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:29,000
things out about pathogen response about

1020
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,959
yield and how to Target the various

1021
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,278
things that may infect these organisms

1022
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,519
of interest uh and I want to thank all

1023
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,960
of these people for helping us get to

1024
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,038
here uh Oregon CBD is very uh noted up

1025
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,440
there because test group has been very

1026
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,480
helpful on on sequencing a lot of these

1027
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,180
things so um I'll leave it for I have

1028
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:52,160
some time for questions thank

1029
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:52,160
[Applause]

1030
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,240
you I can't quite see out there so I'm

1031
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,558
not can see there's no one at the

1032
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,200
microphone that's about all I can tell

1033
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:02,200
other than maybe

1034
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:10,719
Ben

1035
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,720
okay do you need the

1036
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,600
second right um okay so our next speaker

1037
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,359
uh we are sadden to hear he's had some

1038
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,480
health issues in his staying home uh for

1039
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,439
this but he did despite all of this uh

1040
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,240
put the time and effort into um

1041
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,360
basically making his presentation

1042
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,599
available so that we're going to have it

1043
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,398
on recording here this is zir punja he

1044
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,439
has done a tremendous amount of work in

1045
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:36,678
pathogens uh that infect cannabis so

1046
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,759
it's very pertinent to what we were just

1047
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:40,360
discussing here uh he's published many

1048
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:41,759
of the papers in the field he's a real

1049
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,439
rock star in the field of um the

1050
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,240
pathogens and infect cannabis so we're

1051
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,320
going to quue up uh zamir pun's

1052
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,359
presentation

1053
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:49,240
next I think we have one question before

1054
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,719
we do

1055
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:56,000
that Kevin you mentioned um with things

1056
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,639
that have the low viral count for Hops

1057
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,398
and viroid that maybe they people should

1058
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:03,678
consider not calling and trying to keep

1059
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:05,558
those that might have that specifically

1060
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,960
really hard to detect low viral count

1061
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:10,838
for hops slate and

1062
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,760
vroid how do you recommend people safely

1063
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:15,320
approach that um being that the virus

1064
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,200
spread so

1065
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:23,159
quickly okay so um what to do about hlvd

1066
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,358
so um we did write an article about this

1067
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,838
I'd Point people to that uh we think

1068
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,598
every this is going to be very acid

1069
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:31,358
dependent but for our at least we think

1070
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,599
anything that's over a CT of 33 retest

1071
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,199
particularly if it's a mother plant that

1072
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:35,960
you care about if it's a clone maybe

1073
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,239
it's not worth retesting because the

1074
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,559
retesting may be more expensive than

1075
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,678
just making another clone but if it's

1076
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,398
one of your heirloom plants everything

1077
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,480
under 33 we believe is something you

1078
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,960
probably want to pull if you're finding

1079
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,800
something that consistently tests at 33

1080
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,440
however I think that's very interesting

1081
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,359
because that's a 100,000 foot lower

1082
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,320
vroid load and we what we don't want to

1083
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,279
happened is that we in the course of of

1084
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,200
of frantically screening these plants we

1085
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,680
rip out the plants that in fact are able

1086
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:03,118
to manage this it could be the fact that

1087
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,239
low vroid load is just a sign the plants

1088
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,119
actually clearing this and not going to

1089
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,519
be affected by it from a yield stpoint I

1090
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,760
mean this happens in human biology as

1091
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,400
well when you look at coron viruses a

1092
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,880
lot of people get reinfected with coron

1093
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,160
virus after they're already immune we

1094
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,640
vaccinated and there's still a virid

1095
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:17,399
load there but they don't get sick uh so

1096
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:18,838
viruses like the presence absence of

1097
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,680
them I don't think is as binary as we

1098
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:22,320
want it to believe want it to be there

1099
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:23,598
are when your immune system is clearing

1100
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,079
these things there will be low levels of

1101
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,599
this RNA that we can pick up for long

1102
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,720
periods of time even in coronavirus

1103
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,880
testing when you're positive you're

1104
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,159
positive for 90 days you're only

1105
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,838
infectious for n we don't understand

1106
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:34,440
that biology with this fibroid yet and

1107
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:35,799
so I'm just putting out a little bit of

1108
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,240
caution there until we understand that

1109
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,119
biology retest it if it's a really

1110
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,759
important mother plant maybe destroy it

1111
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:42,760
if it's in fact a

1112
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,639
clone so do we have a sense of whether

1113
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,838
there's an Entourage effect working with

1114
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:58,318
u with psilocybin mushrooms similar to

1115
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,880
to cannabis where it's the interaction

1116
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:03,199
of not just psilocybin but other

1117
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,519
compounds that affects how someone

1118
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,199
feels sorry I'm I'm jumping down because

1119
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,358
of sound is better down there so yes is

1120
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,838
there an Entourage effect I think is

1121
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,920
what you're saying in psilocybin and um

1122
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,559
just like in the path of moving from

1123
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,079
olivetolic acid to CBG onto more mature

1124
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:19,559
cannabinoids the same thing is going on

1125
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,920
in the psilocybin pathway where we're

1126
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,318
moving from El tropen and we're we're

1127
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,920
decorating that molecule with different

1128
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:27,119
methyl groups and phosphor lating it

1129
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,838
along the way so you get the spectrum of

1130
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,920
molecule like origin biocytin sosin um

1131
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,838
and and psilocybin there's also norin

1132
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,880
and nor biocytin that that that are

1133
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,519
different derivatives of these molecules

1134
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,800
that's one Entourage effect the second

1135
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,800
Entourage effect I think that's in the

1136
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,480
mushroom that's a little bit more

1137
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,920
interesting is that there are compounds

1138
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,679
like these beta carbolines that we know

1139
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,720
are monoamino oxidase Inhibitors that

1140
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:48,679
change the way that your body

1141
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,439
metabolizes the former ones and some of

1142
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,679
those are even psychoactive themselves

1143
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,079
so there is an Entourage in these things

1144
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:55,519
and we don't really know which mushrooms

1145
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,800
are making these and our effort here is

1146
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,440
to try to tie the genotypes to those

1147
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,480
particular chema types over time we want

1148
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,679
to collaborate with people that can do

1149
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,280
the chemotyping right now we don't know

1150
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,358
a lot of people that can do that um

1151
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,160
we're also hiring so um for folks out

1152
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,559
there like this is uh this is part of

1153
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:12,239
the problem we want to solve and we need

1154
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,239
need more people for it
