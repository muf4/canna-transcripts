2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,570
our knowledge of the effect of cannabis

3
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:16,809
and the use of cannabis is expanding all

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,999
the time we're learning how cannabis

5
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:21,488
works were learning about the mechanism

6
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:28,629
of cannabis work and we are learning how

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:31,509
it affects different states of well

8
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:33,369
disease one type of disease another type

9
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:36,189
of disease and we have to learn that and

10
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:40,209
we have to expand our knowledge all the

11
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:45,189
time and I'm glad to learn that the

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:48,518
meeting of can met this year is going to

13
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:51,549
do exactly that it's going to tell us

14
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:54,329
about the new things that we have

15
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:58,828
learned over the last few years on

16
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:03,489
cannabis use in medicine and just to

17
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,510
give you a few examples we published

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,539
that

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:11,640
cannabidiol is effective in several

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,320
neurological diseases in particular

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,260
epilepsy many many years ago we

22
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:21,849
published actually a clinical paper on

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:24,490
epilepsy but the the use of cannabis or

24
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:27,549
Canobie diode in epilepsy was not taken

25
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:30,269
over for 30 years we should not allow

26
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:33,849
this to happen again we should try to

27
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:38,289
move from basic science to clinical

28
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:41,079
science as fast as possible and this I

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:45,010
hope will be happening over the next few

30
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:49,780
years and I hope that by having meetings

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:54,820
like can MIT will make possible this

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:57,489
faster advance and I can just mention a

33
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,919
few diseases that I believe can be

34
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:02,619
helped with cannabis but at the moment

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,340
they're not being used to any to any

36
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:10,330
extent because clinical trials missing

37
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,610
for example diabetes type 1 which is an

38
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,170
autoimmune disease namely the body

39
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,770
attacks

40
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:20,169
the cells that produce insulin and the

41
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,750
body doesn't have enough insulin as sick

42
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:25,989
well we found in animals that

43
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:29,620
cannabidiol is very effective but it has

44
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:33,100
not been tried yet in humans I believe

45
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,310
that it will be helpful it may be a

46
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:37,299
pretty good cure I hope but we don't

47
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,310
have the data

48
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:45,819
another example is schizophrenia about

49
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,900
1% the world population has

50
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:52,929
schizophrenia and it has been shown in

51
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,140
clinical trials in this case that it

52
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:59,709
definitely is hopeful cannabidiol at

53
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:03,429
very high doses it's helpful and yet it

54
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:09,699
is not being used I have no idea why but

55
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:11,939
if we show in many preclinical and

56
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:15,759
clinical trials that it's useful

57
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:18,489
ultimately it will be used and there are

58
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:22,269
many many other examples and I believe

59
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:25,209
that one of the ways to expand our

60
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:28,569
knowledge to put pressure when needed

61
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:32,110
so that cannabis or specific Anna Beadon

62
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:36,939
cannot be no it's like cannabidiol or

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:40,900
THC and by having these meetings we can

64
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:44,259
help and I believe that can met 2:18

65
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,909
will be one of the major most important

66
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:53,039
meetings in this area this year

67
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:53,579
