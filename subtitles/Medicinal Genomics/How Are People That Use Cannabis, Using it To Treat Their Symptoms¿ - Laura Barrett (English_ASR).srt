[Music]

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,200
so yeah I I was curious how are people

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,160
using cannabis kind of to treat their

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,759
symptoms is it sort of like a a

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,118
preventative thing or like a a kind of

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,160
daily um usage just to kind of keep

7
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,118
symptoms at Bay or do they actually use

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,518
it um in an acute situation where like

9
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,039
you said having a panic attack or having

10
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,519
an episode ingesting cannabis to kind of

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:39,359
get back to Baseline that's a really

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,399
great question so first of all for the

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,600
the research study we just started

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,039
collecting patients in October so we're

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,558
we're still in the data collection um or

16
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,280
well I mean we don't even have any data

17
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,479
yet we're still in the patient

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,558
recruitment part of of that study um and

19
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,119
then once we get all the patients and we

20
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,358
sort of close off which I think we're

21
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:05,399
doing January first then we're going to

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:09,439
do um we have that like six months is

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,759
the survey so so there's that uh but in

24
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:16,000
my practice so I am um independent I

25
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,319
work as a consultant I'm a registered

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,200
nurse and I I coach people and work with

27
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:25,239
people alongside of their doctor

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,200
um as a bridge uh my my favorite thing

29
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,519
to say about nursing and cannabis is

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,960
well holistic and plant medicine overall

31
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,759
is is we are the bridge we're the bridge

32
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,158
between the provider and the dispensary

33
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:40,399
for the patient we're the bridge between

34
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,560
like uh traditional medicine and then

35
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,159
holistic and integrative medicine I'm

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,840
writing a book nurses are the bridge

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:53,600
coming soon hopefully by Puerto Rico uh

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:58,200
so as that nurse coach nurse educator in

39
00:01:53,599 --> 00:02:01,839
in my practice with patients I have

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,240
many people that have um suffered from

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,478
like sexual

42
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:12,120
trauma domestic violence and

43
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:16,239
uh many of them are women and many of

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:21,920
them have like an overwhelming sense of

45
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:25,840
Doom every day W and that there really

46
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:28,559
aren't a good group of or a good

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,840
protocol for prescription medications

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,280
I'm I'm a plant medic a nurse but I'm

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,680
very much also for integrating

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
traditional Pharmaceuticals we just

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,920
don't have a lot of traditional

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,719
pharmaceutical that that work or that

53
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,958
you have to take so many or the side

54
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:49,878
effects are so much that that can

55
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,680
relieve the symptoms so I have people

56
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:57,359
getting back to your question that take

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,680
a a a low dose of just something

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,879
routinely which we have some pretty good

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,719
uh data and some of our our friends that

60
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:09,399
are very involved with uh canmed and

61
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,560
medicinal genomics would share that you

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,319
know one to one equal amounts of CBD and

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,479
THC have have been known in low doses to

64
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,479
be helpful for anxiety and so I do have

65
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,959
some people that that utilize those

66
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,840
types of routes of administration we're

67
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,479
getting more data more research recently

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,039
about another canono CBG being really

69
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,438
helpful also for

70
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:39,759
anxiety but to your point depending on

71
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:41,959
when their symptoms are worse generally

72
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,639
so if it's not that they just wake up

73
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,039
every day with that impending doom and

74
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,679
need something if it is more about being

75
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,438
in the world and being triggered like

76
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,120
potentially somebody that was in a

77
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:56,719
traumatic car accident uh might have

78
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,239
anxiety just every time they have to get

79
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:02,318
in the car and drive and

80
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,920
I'm not going to encourage people to

81
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,919
smoke a little bit before they get in

82
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,359
the car and drive we have to be

83
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,078
thoughtful right so in that case we

84
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,760
definitely would be considering a less

85
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,799
intoxicating um route uh less cannaboid

86
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,358
and and less intoxicating route we want

87
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:24,120
people to be safe on the road but if it

88
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,399
is that they're going to be uh home or

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,160
they're in an environment where they're

90
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:31,000
not the driver uh then potentially if

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,479
they are triggered having an inhalation

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,519
option available whether that is uh in

93
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:41,319
inhaling like a lot of times honestly I

94
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,198
tell people with um post-traumatic

95
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,360
stress disorder and like panic attacks

96
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,520
related to it to consider carrying a

97
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,120
vape pen like like it's an epip pen so

98
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,279
so have it on you you don't have again

99
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,199
in a legal state where you legally can

100
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:59,918
use it have it there just just knowing

101
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,639
you have it might help you you might not

102
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:06,240
even need to use it but it's easier and

103
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,960
more accessible than having to actually

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,600
light something and smoke it in

105
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,638
environments where with the state of our

106
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
country we would still not be be able to

107
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,639
do that

108
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,120
everywhere but I have had experience

109
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,560
with multiple uh patients where just

110
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,639
having it in their purse on their person

111
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,720
just knowing they have it has been

112
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,800
enough for their brain to release the

113
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,680
sympathetic nervous system get back to

114
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,759
um a more natural response um and and

115
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:44,199
feel feel better and or they can take a

116
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:48,319
puff or two and immediately have some

117
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:51,319
relief so I I think it can be used and

118
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm interested to see this the survey uh

119
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,800
responses because I think it can be used

120
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,280
for like the in the moment but we would

121
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,560
be looking my my goal for for PE most

122
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,679
people is hopefully to prevent having to

123
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,680
even get to that having to prevent those

124
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,439
feelings because when our body is

125
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,639
releasing all that cortisol and going

126
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,160
through that that triggered response uh

127
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,840
it's it's unhealthy for us it doesn't

128
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,759
feel good I mean I've had panic attacks

129
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,799
it doesn't feel good so I I would prefer

130
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,439
it if we could just keep the edge off

131
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,639
that and utilize the tools of cannabis

132
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,759
medicine plant medicine and maybe

133
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,280
entheogenic medicine and some

134
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:37,879
psychedelics to to do the work do the

135
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:41,159
therapy retrain our brain to to learn a

136
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,159
new response

137
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:55,939
