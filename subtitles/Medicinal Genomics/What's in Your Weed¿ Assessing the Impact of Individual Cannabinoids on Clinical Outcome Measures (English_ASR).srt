1
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,839
well first I'd like to thank the

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,419
organizers of can Med for so graciously

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,000
and generously inviting me to once again

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,439
be part of their annual conference Ken

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,960
met is one of my absolute favorite

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,899
conferences and I'm so sorry not to be

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,539
able to join you in person this year but

8
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,519
with that I will talk about what's in

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,380
your weed assessing the impact of

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,839
individual cannabinoids on clinical

11
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,538
outcome measures

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,640
now as I don't really have to explain to

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,920
this audience cannabis has been part of

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
ancient civilizations with references to

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,539
its use spanning thousands and thousands

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,079
of years in fact it was part of our U.S

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,878
pharmacopoeia in 1850 doctors could and

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,799
did prescribed cannabis it wasn't a

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,238
recommendation for use or a

20
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,399
certification for use it was a

21
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,019
prescription or any number of

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,820
indications or conditions or symptoms

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,620
that patients had

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,679
through a series of events it fell out

25
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:01,859
of favor in 1937 and by 1942 was pulled

26
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,479
from the U.S pharmacopoeia and in 1970

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,700
it was placed in the most restrictive

28
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,859
class of the newly created controlled

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,079
substance Act was classified as a

30
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,478
schedule 1 substance but it remains

31
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,000
today schedule one substance

32
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,039
since 1970

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,900
um when cannabis was declared a schedule

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
on substance California was the very

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,100
first state to re-legalize cannabis for

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,859
medical purposes in 1996

37
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:31,019
1996 I make this point because by the

38
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,239
time my own state had legalized cannabis

39
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,519
for medical purposes and you can see in

40
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,739
that timeline how different states sort

41
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,840
of followed California's lead but by the

42
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,478
time Massachusetts legalized cannabis

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,859
for medical purposes in 2012 there was

44
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,599
still absolutely nothing in the

45
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,280
literature with regard to what I would

46
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,158
call the long-term or longitudinal

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,259
impact of medical cannabis

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,780
um that surprised me pretty much

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,938
everything we know about cannabis comes

50
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,340
from studies of young primarily healthy

51
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:02,039
recreational Cannabis consumers in fact

52
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,140
my lab has been studying the impact of

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,118
recreational cannabis use for decades at

54
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,739
that time and I was quite interested in

55
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,780
understanding the potential differences

56
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,699
in those using for recreational versus

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,560
medical purposes so I scouted the

58
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,839
literature figuring there had to be

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,420
something and I did find some studies of

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,280
acute administration of some products

61
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,199
for medical purposes but nothing that

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,699
looked at Patients or subjects pre

63
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,039
versus post

64
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,959
nothing that classified or characterized

65
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,900
cognitive performance or really even

66
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,819
clinical change as a primary outcome and

67
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,300
nothing but followed patients over time

68
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:38,039
nothing at all so in 2014 I established

69
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,020
the marijuana investigations for

70
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,598
neuroscientific Discovery program or the

71
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,459
Mind program at McLean Hospital

72
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,018
so this is really the first program of

73
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,878
its kind and it's dedicated to looking

74
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,459
at the long-term impact of medical

75
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:53,280
cannabis use on things like clinical

76
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,199
State cognitive performance Sleep

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,360
Quality of Life conventional medication

78
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,919
use where applicable measures of brain

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,420
structure and function and related

80
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,059
measures pretty much anything we can

81
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,500
think of right the program uses

82
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,539
longitudinal observational

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,180
cross-sectional survey and clinical

84
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,459
trial models and it supports projects

85
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,159
designed to examine custom formulated

86
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,739
novel cannabinoid-based therapies for a

87
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,899
range of symptoms and conditions we

88
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,640
examine major and minor cannabinoids and

89
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,800
their impact on clinical and cognitive

90
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,179
outcomes and the ultimate goal here

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,519
really is to be able to harness

92
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,260
therapeutic potential while minimizing

93
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,120
risk and harm related to medical

94
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,639
cannabis use

95
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,860
so our very first longitudinal

96
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,158
observational study again longitudinal

97
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,239
observational study not a clinical trial

98
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:42,298
observational study

99
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,239
was designed to actually set the stage

100
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,799
for for other types of studies but this

101
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,539
study really looked at clinical State

102
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,400
cognitive performance mood sleep

103
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,500
conventional medication use all those

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,239
things I just mentioned to you and

105
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,000
individuals who were interested in using

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,319
medical cannabis before they began their

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,299
treatment measurement this is a very

108
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,919
important point so here are folks with

109
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,780
berries and Sundry indications and

110
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,939
conditions who are interested in

111
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,560
exploring medical cannabis use for

112
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,299
whatever indication or condition they'd

113
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,620
like but we've seen them before they

114
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:16,079
begin using okay we then follow them

115
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,418
initially we had very ambitious goals of

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,519
going out to almost one full year which

117
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,680
we thought was a lofty goal we have now

118
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,000
extend that several times we now follow

119
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,740
patients out to three years because

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,939
generally once they're enrolled they

121
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,120
don't want to stop

122
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,800
which is wonderful so we see them for a

123
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,978
baseline visit before they begin using

124
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,900
and we see them again at months 3 6 12

125
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:41,279
15 18 24 and now 30 and 36. uh we also

126
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,859
talked to them every month with regard

127
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,379
to their medical cannabis use and other

128
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,000
things they can use medical cannabis for

129
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,180
any indication or condition that they'd

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,060
like pain sleep mood anything and their

131
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,560
choice of products those products are

132
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,560
ultimately assessed by an outside

133
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,060
laboratory more on that in a moment the

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,740
assessments that they complete at each

135
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,019
of the time points those what I call the

136
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,220
Milestone

137
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:08,039
study visits so again Baseline three

138
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,240
months 6 12 Etc they consist of things

139
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,460
like clinical ratings where we're

140
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,379
looking at pain mood anxiety sleep

141
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,579
quality of life and anything else I can

142
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,500
think of

143
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,359
um very detailed uh information

144
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,160
regarding their medical cannabis use so

145
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,139
really detailed fine-grained information

146
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,699
individual level data

147
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,699
um the actual products are using product

148
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,160
type frequency amount Source cannabinoid

149
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,780
constituent profile Etc conventional

150
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,360
medication use because we're looking at

151
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,399
potential change over time measures of

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,740
cognitive performance and of course when

153
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,478
we can a multimodal neural Imaging

154
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,400
protocol that allows me to look at their

155
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,139
brain structure and function and all

156
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,299
sorts of other things so it's a pretty

157
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,800
comprehensive longitudinal observational

158
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,560
study

159
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
in order to be considered eligible for

160
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,759
this study people have to be over the

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,340
age of 21 and have a valid certification

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,419
for medical cannabis use or plan to use

163
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:59,819
products that don't require

164
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:02,279
certification this whole landscape has

165
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,620
shifted slightly since the legalization

166
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,478
for adulter recreational use

167
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,220
but back to the certifications they can

168
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,719
be for a range of indications as I

169
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,940
mentioned we didn't limit this first

170
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,039
study to any specific individual

171
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,019
clinical cohort we weren't sure how many

172
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,418
people we would get they have to be

173
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,279
candidates naive or have no regular

174
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:21,839
consistent use of cannabis over the past

175
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,059
several years and they have to be

176
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,519
negative for THC at Baseline

177
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,139
we also had a group of control patients

178
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,359
so these are individuals who have

179
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,819
similar conditions and indications as

180
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,800
our medical cannabis cohort but who are

181
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,240
not interested in using medical cannabis

182
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,220
at least when they sign up they're not

183
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,780
we've lost several people in the

184
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,400
treatment as usual group to the actual

185
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,978
treatment group over time not

186
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,138
surprisingly

187
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:47,939
so in 2016 we published our first paper

188
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,519
I was asked by a journal to get at least

189
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,439
10 patients from Baseline to their first

190
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,019
longitudinal assessment which was three

191
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,819
months I think we published on 11. again

192
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,099
we looked at these folks before they

193
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,259
began using medical cannabis and three

194
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,300
months after they had been using and

195
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:05,580
what we found was really quite striking

196
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,319
we found improvements on some measures

197
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,060
of executive function in clinical State

198
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,280
and a reduction in their use of

199
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,978
conventional medications use the reason

200
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,899
that these findings were so important at

201
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,758
least in my mind was that again we'd

202
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,620
spent decades looking at the impact of

203
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,300
recreational cannabis use on target

204
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,740
performance and clinical measures and

205
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,900
measures of brain structure and function

206
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,340
and generally I will work in the work of

207
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,439
colleagues across the country and

208
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:30,239
throughout the globe had suggested that

209
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,459
individuals especially those who began

210
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,900
using early on in the developmental

211
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,638
trajectory when the brain is still

212
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,159
vulnerable

213
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,418
um had decrements in certain aspects of

214
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,400
cognitive performance for example

215
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,959
measures of executive function we didn't

216
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,579
necessarily see those same patterns of

217
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,500
people who began using lighter a very

218
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,839
important distinction but so here's this

219
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,819
first study of medical cannabis patients

220
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,560
over the course of three months showing

221
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,259
no decrements in cognitive performance

222
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,060
but improvements so we expanded that

223
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,620
study and actually ultimately and I

224
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,060
should say that that first study got a

225
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,160
ton of media attention and I think it

226
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,759
was in the top five percent of all the

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,099
uh studies referenced in metric we uh

228
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,419
published I think in 2021 on a cohort

229
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:11,699
that we followed over the course of one

230
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:13,439
year this was uh 54 patients followed

231
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,960
over the course of a year again before

232
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,000
they began and then at 3 6 and 12 months

233
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,739
and once again what we found were

234
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,180
significant improvements on some

235
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,098
measures of executive function and

236
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,560
clinical State over the course of their

237
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,060
12 months of treatment we also found

238
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,280
that measures of verbal learning and

239
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,199
memory generally remain stable so no

240
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,240
decrements first and foremost what we

241
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,620
see in these studies is no decrements in

242
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,680
cognitive performance or clinical state

243
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,360
but improvements very very important so

244
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,679
this study has continued and now I'm

245
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,639
going to show you data from a larger

246
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,038
sample

247
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,480
so this is a data set of 67 medical

248
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,338
cannabis patients who completed a

249
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,300
Baseline and at least one follow-up

250
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,700
study

251
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:53,039
and you can see on the left hand side of

252
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,200
the screen that these folks are about 46

253
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,759
years of age so let's just say beyond

254
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
the period of neurodevelopmental

255
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,360
vulnerability these are not kids or

256
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,039
emerging adults right they're

257
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,278
predominantly Caucasian they have a

258
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:07,559
higher than average IQ at almost 120 and

259
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,539
they're well educated 16.54 years of

260
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,518
education as a reminder 16 years of

261
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,759
education is analogous to a college

262
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,860
degree duration of cannabis abstinence

263
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,159
so they've been abstinent from cannabis

264
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,500
use on average for 20.3 years that that

265
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,879
makes sense since most of the time if

266
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,980
these folks have had any history of

267
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,958
cannabis use it's a remote history of

268
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,879
use in high school or college

269
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,139
what are they using cannabis for what

270
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,838
are they interested in using canvas for

271
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,519
when they first enroll well the top

272
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,260
three indications really Echo what we

273
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,659
see across this country the top three

274
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,659
spots in this country and really every

275
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:44,519
state generally fall between pain where

276
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:46,199
anxiety as numbers one and two and then

277
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,259
sleep so in this cohort it's anxiety

278
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,240
PTSD then pain then sleep then there's

279
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:54,059
mood and attention and other what's

280
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,339
other inflammatory bowel disease chronic

281
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:57,899
migraine headache as I mentioned we also

282
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,880
have a pilot group of treatment as usual

283
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,799
patients with similar conditions but who

284
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,740
are not using cannabis so we also looked

285
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,778
at those folks over time

286
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,580
in terms of some of the assessments they

287
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:10,259
get these are self-report rating scales

288
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,000
in terms of looking at mood anxiety

289
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,319
sleep pain and quality of life and I

290
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,299
wanted to just highlight what some of

291
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,580
these are they're the profile of mood

292
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,259
state of really really common measure

293
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,420
all of these are very very common well

294
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,700
validated measures here we're looking at

295
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,679
total mood disturbance we also do the

296
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,259
back depression inventory very common

297
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,579
measure of depressive symptoms for

298
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,500
anxiety we have the back anxiety

299
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,560
inventory and the state trait anxiety

300
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,000
inventory again classic for Sleep our

301
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,000
primary outcome measure is Pittsburgh

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,259
Sleep Quality Index or the psqi for pain

303
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
we're looking at the numeric rating

304
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:44,100
scale the pain distress scale the pain

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,078
Disability Index and for quality of life

306
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,300
I'm going to show you data on the hoop

307
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,879
calls again this is a subset of what's

308
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:53,278
actually administered so first taking a

309
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,860
look at our cohort over the course of

310
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,019
one year in terms of mood what we see

311
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,459
again total mood disturbance of the

312
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,560
profile of those state is on the left

313
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,000
and the bank depression inventory is on

314
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,219
the right but overwhelmingly what we've

315
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,200
seen is that patients report significant

316
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,320
improvements in mood related symptoms

317
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,240
between 3 and 12 months after initiating

318
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,920
medical cannabis treatment the grain

319
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,959
line is our medical cannabis patients

320
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,240
the blue line is our treatment as usual

321
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:20,879
folks and what you see is a

322
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,700
statistically significant Improvement at

323
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,799
each time point for the MC patients we

324
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,019
do not see this change and treatment as

325
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,899
usual patients okay that's true for the

326
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,060
TMD and the BDI

327
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,620
when we turn to anxiety which is a very

328
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,778
a very special area of focus and

329
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,220
interest in my group once again we have

330
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,919
the back anxiety inventory on the left

331
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,700
and the trade scale of the STI on the

332
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,519
right

333
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,740
patients once again report statistically

334
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,440
significant improvements and symptoms of

335
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,480
anxiety between Baseline 3 6 and 12

336
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,399
months of treatment the treatment as

337
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,200
usual folks those folks on the blue line

338
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,659
that's the Blue Line there do not

339
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,399
demonstrate the same pattern no

340
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,159
improvement

341
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,200
looking at sleep patients are generally

342
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,539
reporting improved Sleep Quality between

343
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,759
3 and 12 months after initiating medical

344
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,919
cannabis use a statistically significant

345
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:14,159
Improvement at each of the time points

346
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:16,078
in the medical cannabis Patient Group we

347
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,379
do not see the same in the treatment as

348
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:18,379
usual

349
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,000
in a subset of patients these are folks

350
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,159
who are using medical cannabis

351
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,839
exclusively for chronic pain conditions

352
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,399
what we see here

353
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,579
is over the course of three to six

354
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,899
months patients with chronic pain report

355
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:35,699
significantly decreased ratings of pain

356
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,320
on the numeric rating scale the pain

357
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,600
distress scale and the pain Disability

358
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,820
Index across the board here okay again

359
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,159
the green line is the patient's blue are

360
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,360
the treatment as usual folks

361
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,399
statistically significant improvements

362
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,440
over the course of a year in the MC

363
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,240
patients that we don't see in the

364
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,820
treatment as usual folks are you sensing

365
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,440
a theme because I am finally with regard

366
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,540
to quality of life and this is the hoop

367
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,220
wall physical health on the left and

368
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,559
psychological Health on the right what

369
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,879
we see are significant improvements on

370
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,859
some aspects of quality of life

371
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,539
specifically here for physical and

372
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,060
psychological Health we actually didn't

373
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,338
see any change in Social relationships

374
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,379
or the environment subscale Sports those

375
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,540
remain pretty stable over time

376
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,519
for psychological and physical health we

377
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:19,919
do see a statistically significant

378
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,899
improvement over the course of one year

379
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,179
of medical cannabis treatment in the

380
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,519
patient group not in the treatment as

381
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:29,159
you should so

382
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,480
pretty interesting uh I mean I think

383
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,559
it's fantastic to see that overall

384
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,060
people are getting better but it

385
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,578
certainly raises the question what's in

386
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,559
your weed what might account for the

387
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:39,539
Improvement and how can we find out

388
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,059
what's in your weed how do we best do

389
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:44,219
this once again I turned back to my

390
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:47,338
extraordinary lab and we were able to

391
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,500
create a step-by-step metric that really

392
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,899
quantifies estimated maximum possible

393
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,240
cannabinoid exposure it's called can

394
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,860
account and it's an improved metric for

395
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,620
quantifying estimates of cannabinoid

396
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,500
exposure the increasing array of

397
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,100
cannabinoid-based products contain

398
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,720
various amounts of different

399
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,000
cannabinoids and other constituents

400
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,980
existing methods are pretty limited

401
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,379
though and none at all account for

402
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,000
actual cannabinoid content of the

403
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,860
products that patients or consumers are

404
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,240
actually using so we created something

405
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,700
this metric

406
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,899
basically considers things like the

407
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,480
actual individual cannabinoid

408
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,399
constituents frequency and duration of

409
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,440
use the amount used and the root of

410
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,200
administration or mode of use all of

411
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,120
these things are incredibly important in

412
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,759
figuring out quote what's in your weed

413
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,200
and what might people be exposed to over

414
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,338
time

415
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,139
so

416
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,820
um this is a just a slide showing

417
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,620
cannabinoid constituent information and

418
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,240
how you get it on the right side what

419
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,860
you see is a laboratory analysis that

420
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,198
breaks down again a cannabinoid

421
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,240
constituent profile how much of each of

422
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,759
the constituents is found

423
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,740
medical cannabis product samples are

424
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,480
basically sent to a third party lab for

425
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,159
this kind of profiling again it

426
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,560
quantifies the amount of individual

427
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,360
cannabinoids if actual product samples

428
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,619
are not available for testing or if

429
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,659
patients are unwilling to partner with

430
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,740
even a tiny amount for testing which so

431
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,439
far has not been a problem thank

432
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,839
goodness you can rely on dispensary or

433
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,880
supplier certificates of analysis if you

434
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,199
have to and also you can use product

435
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,600
labels

436
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,039
um not preferred given the very known

437
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,778
and very obvious issues with product

438
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,539
labeling accuracy so what you really

439
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:23,338
want is to get a sample of the actual

440
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:25,198
products that patients are using and

441
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,360
have an outside lab analyzed that's how

442
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,799
we did it so as an overview of can

443
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
account and I won't belabor this too

444
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,698
much you can pull the paper it's really

445
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,339
really helpful step-by-step guide

446
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,899
but basically we're querying patients um

447
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,760
and and you can use this with

448
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,379
recreational consumers as well for

449
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,399
people who are interested in figuring it

450
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,720
out

451
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,539
um you're asking questions about product

452
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,639
type frequency amount or magnitude use

453
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,559
and duration of use and again then we

454
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,299
get this laboratory assessment we

455
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,919
organize the data and then convert the

456
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,958
data into what I would call preferred

457
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,399
units for the calculations so we might

458
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,698
convert for example things like

459
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,980
percentage to milligrams per gram

460
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:03,659
um or millimeters to gram

461
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,720
um we also account for conversion of the

462
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:08,879
acid form uh to the active forms right

463
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,860
that's really really important and we

464
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,019
calculate exposure generally in two ways

465
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,060
you can use one or both of these one is

466
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,578
the discrete use approach so patients

467
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:20,099
report frequency and amount of the

468
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:22,259
products used each time so how much and

469
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,778
uh and how often they're using each

470
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,698
individual product or they can report

471
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:28,740
the total amount of a product used over

472
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:31,019
a period of time so for example I might

473
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,419
say to a patient so you bought three and

474
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,159
a half grams of X flour how long did it

475
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:37,620
take for you to go through that how did

476
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,838
you use it Etc so those are just some

477
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,940
examples can account this metric can

478
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,459
actually be used to estimate exposure to

479
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,959
any cannabinoid not just THC and CBD

480
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,359
which most people spend a ton of time on

481
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,518
but the miners as well as long as the

482
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,560
cannabinoid content is known and derived

483
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,078
from what I would call a reliable source

484
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,239
that's really really important

485
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:58,859
um this is just a quick slide that shows

486
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,839
you how you calculate exposure for the

487
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,539
discrete use approach versus the total

488
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,578
use approach but this is all detailed in

489
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,139
the publication and all of this is just

490
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:08,519
a way of getting to what I want to show

491
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,860
you which is the what's in your weed

492
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,720
Factor but again

493
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,039
um you can actually some cannabinoid

494
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,600
exposure for each route of

495
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,818
administration so for example you have

496
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,438
folks who are using roots of ventilation

497
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:21,418
they're smoking and they're vaping you

498
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,860
can sum those you can also some for

499
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,140
example anything that was an oral

500
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,298
Administration or mucosal or a

501
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,700
skin-based product some have asked us

502
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:32,700
whether they can sum exposure across

503
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,500
product types you certainly can

504
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,298
um I don't necessarily recommend it

505
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,579
because it doesn't account for different

506
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:40,079
bioavailability across product type and

507
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,178
root of administration we all know that

508
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,678
right the ways in which we use these

509
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,480
products and individual product types

510
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,720
are not all created people but back to

511
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,700
our own sample of patients so this is a

512
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,700
bar graph that basically illustrates

513
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,460
exposure to Delta 9 THC and cannabidiol

514
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,319
or CBD at three months and at six months

515
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,720
and what you see so THC is the dark

516
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,579
green and CBD is the minty green what

517
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,380
you see um immediately is that between

518
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,000
Baseline and three and Baseline in six

519
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,179
months our patients are being exposed to

520
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,579
significantly more CBD than THC

521
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:14,038
this is perhaps not surprising because

522
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:16,558
generally our patients are very clear on

523
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,179
not wanting to be high or altered in

524
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,879
fact what they say is Dr Robert I don't

525
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,440
want to be messed up I can't uh sort of

526
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,059
be checked out during the day I have a

527
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,038
job to do I just want to be able to

528
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,779
sleep through the night or I just want

529
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:31,200
to be able to take a walk with my

530
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,339
husband or remember my kid's birthday or

531
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,259
something that's what they tell you

532
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,480
they're not looking to be high so very

533
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:38,339
often they're choosing products that

534
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,419
have an array of non-intoxicating

535
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:44,339
cannabinoids very often rich in CBD

536
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:46,919
so to examine the unique contributions

537
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,259
of THC and CBD we actually conducted an

538
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,179
examined correlations between these

539
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:52,919
cannabinoids and outcome variables so

540
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,320
clinical measures and here's what we

541
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,580
found relative to Baseline following

542
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,439
three months of medical cannabis

543
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,298
treatment

544
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,340
irthc exposure was actually related to

545
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:04,379
improvements in pain severity as

546
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,178
measured on the visual analog scale and

547
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,860
the numeric rating scale and pain

548
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,140
related distress you can see that in

549
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,058
these graphs right so higher THC

550
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,799
exposure and you know greater

551
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:16,259
Improvement we didn't see any

552
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,558
relationship between higher tat exposure

553
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:21,240
and mood or anxiety measures so what

554
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,339
happens at six months

555
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,558
relative to Baseline at six months of

556
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:28,019
medical cannabis treatment th exposure

557
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:30,359
is no longer related to any measure a

558
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,279
pain or mood or anxiety so we saw it at

559
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,719
three months we didn't see it in six

560
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,700
months really really interesting

561
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,798
especially when we consider what's

562
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,779
coming next

563
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,119
with regard to CBD or can have a dial

564
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:44,879
relative to Baseline after three months

565
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,558
of medical cannabis treatment higher CBD

566
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,720
exposure was actually related to

567
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,819
improvements in mood we see this in the

568
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,100
Palms total mood disturbance score the

569
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:55,079
back depression inventory and anxiety

570
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:57,959
measures so both the trait and the state

571
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,759
measures we also see it in terms of

572
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,919
improvement on disability caused by pain

573
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,660
so the the pain Disability Index very

574
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,559
very important that's three months of

575
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,740
treatment

576
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:11,038
at six months of treatment now what we

577
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,720
see is higher CBDs exposure continues to

578
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,759
be associated with all of those measures

579
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,839
so we have that the total disturbance

580
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,519
and BDI and the anxiety and PDI scores

581
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:23,879
ircbd greater Improvement on all of

582
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,740
those measures and now we also have an

583
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,299
association with improvements in pain

584
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,720
severity as measured by the numeric

585
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:32,460
rating scale and pain related distress

586
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,620
so at six months we see the same

587
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,798
improvements with CBD on mood and

588
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:39,959
anxiety and pain pain distress and

589
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,359
that's uh now we're seeing pain severity

590
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,100
and pain distress also improving with

591
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,099
CBD very very interesting

592
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,279
as I probably don't have to explain to

593
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,460
this audience given some of our esteemed

594
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,798
folks in the uh in the audience I'm sure

595
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,538
um minor cannabinoids often exert a

596
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,160
major impact and although we need more

597
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:00,660
work in this area we certainly have a

598
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,940
fair amount of evidence suggesting that

599
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,820
some of the so-called minor cannabinoids

600
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,740
termed only minor because of the amount

601
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:09,899
within which they are present in

602
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,640
chemomars they can have a major

603
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,038
therapeutic effect so for example

604
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,380
cannabis Gerald or CBG has been shown to

605
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,240
exhibit anti-tumor antioxidant and

606
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,039
anti-inflammatory properties and is

607
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,038
often tattered as being neurogenic can

608
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,119
have a chromine or CBC

609
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:26,099
hypothesized have anti-inflammatory

610
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,319
antibacterial antifungal effects and

611
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:31,139
also shown to increase viability of

612
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,058
adult neural stem regenitor cells thcv

613
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,100
or tetrahydroconavivarin shown to

614
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:38,099
inhibit some of the negative cognitive

615
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,418
and physiologic effects related to THC

616
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,740
Administration it may also be

617
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,780
neuroprotective and that's just the

618
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,779
beginning so much more so the question

619
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:47,399
is what about the miners

620
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:49,619
well when we looked at the minor

621
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,798
cannabinoid exposure uh in our

622
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:55,619
population what we see is is certainly

623
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:59,579
um a range across the board with with

624
00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:01,379
CBG and the acid form CBN CBC and thcv

625
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:02,639
but it raises the question of what's

626
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,520
what's in their weed what's in the

627
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,559
product so we did an analysis of all the

628
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,058
products submitted by our patients to

629
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,099
look at the presence of minors and what

630
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:12,538
we found this is all of the capitals let

631
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,339
me be clear not just them either this is

632
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:16,379
everything and I'm going to pull out the

633
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:18,899
miners so first and foremost when we

634
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,120
consider all of the constituents 82

635
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,600
percent of the products submitted had

636
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:27,058
detectable CBD 70 almost 71 percent had

637
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,939
detectable Delta 9. and really right

638
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:33,178
after that the next step Canada or CBG

639
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:36,720
at 58.8 percent and cannabochromine CBC

640
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:40,159
at 54.9 so well over 50 for those two

641
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:44,100
after that you have the acid form of CBD

642
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,840
you have CBN or cannabinol thcv Etc so

643
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,418
very very interesting right in terms of

644
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:51,418
what's in these products

645
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,880
so in more than 50 of the samples we

646
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:56,038
found CBG and CBC so we conducted

647
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,260
preliminary analyzes to look at the

648
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,900
potential relationship between these two

649
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:02,940
cannabinoids and any potential change in

650
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,280
clinical outcome what domains are we

651
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,538
looking at once again pain mood and

652
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,759
anxiety

653
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:12,658
and here's what we found

654
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:15,298
increased exposure to CBG and CBC were

655
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,640
both associated with lower distress

656
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:20,220
related to pain if you look on the left

657
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,980
that's CBG and the pain distress scale

658
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,259
on the left hand side significant and on

659
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,880
the right hand side that's CBC and the

660
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,460
pain distress scale so really really

661
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,919
interesting right we're not necessarily

662
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,380
seeing relationships between CBG and CBC

663
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,500
and actual mood and anxiety measures in

664
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,940
fact we didn't we looked we looked again

665
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,819
there's no relationships that we found

666
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,640
in this preliminary analysis between CBG

667
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:46,798
or CBC and any specific mood or anxiety

668
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,320
measure instead we're seeing lower

669
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,879
distress related to pain distress

670
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,099
related to pain

671
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,380
so let me summarize what we see so far

672
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,178
in a longitudinal observational sample

673
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,280
of medical cannabis patients the

674
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,740
clinical data are clearly showing areas

675
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,480
of significant Improvement between 3 and

676
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,400
12 months of treatment after initiating

677
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,259
their medical cannabis regimen

678
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,538
we're seeing improvements in measures of

679
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,619
mood anxiety sleep pain and quality of

680
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:12,900
life

681
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:15,839
their treatment regimens contain vastly

682
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:18,360
greater amounts of CBD relative to THC

683
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,579
we get that by using this great metric

684
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,399
can account and actually quantifying

685
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:25,139
exposure to individual cannabinoids over

686
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,600
time we're not guessing we're not taking

687
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,159
their word for it we're actually

688
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,199
quantifying it accurate estimates of

689
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,419
cannabinoid exposure using can account

690
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,038
or this metric will help clarify the

691
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,840
impact of cannabinoids on treatment

692
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,819
outcomes and hopefully generate more

693
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,079
accurate risk benefit ratios we're

694
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:41,579
desperately in need of it we need

695
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,980
something to help us

696
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,538
we also saw improvements related to THC

697
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,679
and CBD exposure that were very

698
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:48,839
different

699
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,120
when we consider pain we saw reductions

700
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,158
in pain associated with higher THC

701
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,859
exposure at three months but we did not

702
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:58,080
see that same relationship at six months

703
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,599
we have three months most associations

704
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,359
between pain and CBD exposure were noted

705
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:05,399
at six months and with regard to CBD we

706
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,918
did see improvements in anxiety and mood

707
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,298
with higher CBD exposure at both three

708
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,759
and six months that seems pretty

709
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:15,000
consistent so very different responses

710
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,558
to these two primary cannabinoids when

711
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,538
we think about them right before we get

712
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,759
to the miners when we consider the

713
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:22,859
miners we saw that the products that are

714
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,140
being used by our patients do contain a

715
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:27,418
range of minor cannabinoids more than 50

716
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,240
percent of all products analyzed

717
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:32,700
contained CBG or CBC

718
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,620
we did see significant relationships

719
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,500
between the minor cannabinoids and

720
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:39,959
measures of pain specifically for CBG

721
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,819
and CBD CBC exposure we saw a

722
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,000
significant association with reduced

723
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:46,798
pain related distress pain related to

724
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,659
stress so clearly we need additional

725
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,278
studies that look at specific

726
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,778
relationships between the so-called

727
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:54,179
minor cannabinoids and the major

728
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:56,519
clinical impact they may have and what

729
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:59,038
subtle nuances they may actually confer

730
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,720
so again pain related distress is not

731
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,000
necessarily the same as pain reduction

732
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,880
so really really interesting and

733
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,278
important area of Investigation

734
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,020
so next up I just want to touch on

735
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:11,700
mindful activities and the fact that we

736
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:12,960
do a lot of custom formulation we're

737
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,759
currently conceptualizing and

738
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,679
formulating a number of additional

739
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:19,140
cannabinoid Blends optimized to treat

740
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,778
various conditions and indications these

741
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,820
are whole plant uh derived full and

742
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:25,980
broad spectrum products hemp and

743
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:27,119
cannabis based and basically I create

744
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,200
study products that are high in

745
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,959
cannabinoids that are typically

746
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,360
considered minor but which demonstrate

747
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,940
tremendous clinical potential in some

748
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,859
cases this is for some of these studies

749
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,720
we're interested in examining the impact

750
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,759
of terpenoids on a number of

751
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,319
biobehavioral measures as well terpenes

752
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,058
of course are the essential oils that

753
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,819
give cannabis is characteristic scent

754
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:49,440
and flavor profile neither THC nor CBD

755
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,658
have a center flavor that's the

756
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,580
terpenoids they themselves have their

757
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,980
own biobehavioral health effects and I'm

758
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:58,379
actually currently optimizing some some

759
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,298
terpenes to ultimately address specific

760
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,220
indications and conditions which are

761
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:04,019
really exciting so we have a number of

762
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,880
clinical trials designed to assess

763
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:08,460
efficacy and safety of custom formulated

764
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,260
full and broad spectrum products and a

765
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,240
number of inds or investigational new

766
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:13,619
drug approvals in hand I'm very very

767
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,380
excited we're looking at moderate to

768
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:17,759
severe anxiety in a number of cohorts

769
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,980
anxiety and agitation and Alzheimer's

770
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,419
related dementia mood and anxiety in

771
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,940
patients with bipolar disorder that's

772
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:26,159
kicking off this month anxiety and pain

773
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,200
in patients with glioblastoma with a

774
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,778
very exciting exploratory aim of

775
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,419
potentially slowing tumor growth

776
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:35,519
and of course we now have a new study

777
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,080
focused on chronic pain and that's

778
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,759
actually taken

779
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:40,740
um a fair amount of work in terms of

780
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,440
optimizing some of these lesser-known

781
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,079
cannabinoids or terpenoids

782
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,000
in addition to considering THC and CBD

783
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,678
content again we're optimizing products

784
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,140
with regard to the miners and their

785
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,759
terminally contact so I would conclude

786
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,059
by saying we have an unprecedented

787
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,778
opportunity to customize and optimize

788
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:59,759
cannabinoid-based treatments for our

789
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:01,558
patients which has the potential to

790
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,538
transform patient care and medicine as

791
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,158
We Know by harnessing therapeutic

792
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:07,339
benefits of cannabis while also

793
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,600
mitigating potential risk and harm

794
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:11,459
based treatments may very well be the

795
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,379
answer for countless individuals for

796
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,538
whom conventional medication doesn't

797
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,880
provide adequate symptom relief or

798
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:19,798
produces unwanted side effects both of

799
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,600
those things unfortunately result in

800
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,400
lower rates of compliance in our

801
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,619
clinical cohorts so we have to do

802
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,000
something right and with this I would

803
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:28,379
thank you for your time and tell you

804
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,900
that I couldn't do any of this work

805
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,179
without my extraordinary team I mean

806
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,100
