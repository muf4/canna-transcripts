2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,079
um in that

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,039
scenario um do they have similar kind of

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,198
therapeutic or you know similar effects

5
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,039
um because I know that in some cases the

6
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,400
neutral versus the acid they actually

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,840
have opposite

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:34,359
effects right so many of the targets of

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,359
CBD and cbda are the same they're

10
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:39,600
they're very similar and and so yeah if

11
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,359
you look at THC versus thca and compare

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,960
their pharmacology in the body very

13
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:47,479
different and when people take them they

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,198
feel very different um CBD versus cbda

15
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,839
is much more similar and so probably you

16
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:53,479
know one of the targets that's going to

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,600
be most important for for people that

18
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:59,198
are using this is the um the activity of

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,079
the serotonin receptor so they both can

20
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,759
kind of reduce anxiety and improve mood

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,599
via that serotonin pathway there's

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,320
there's been a number of animal studies

23
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,438
looking at the two um sometimes not in

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,079
the same study but two different studies

25
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,879
that have used the same model to

26
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,679
evaluate cbda versus CBD and you'll see

27
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,879
that they they can do the same thing

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,640
they both can reduce seizures they both

29
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,599
can decrease inflammatory pain they both

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,519
can uh decrease nausea and vomiting you

31
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,640
know there's there's a lot of overlap

32
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,959
there uh mechanistically It's usually

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,680
the same Target the the way in which

34
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,599
they're achieving these outcomes is the

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,759
same but the dosing is often vastly

36
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:44,640
different with cbda requiring a much

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,599
lower dose suggesting it as uh well what

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,359
we know from the animal studies is that

39
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:50,959
it has both better bioavailability so

40
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,599
take a dose more of it's getting into

41
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,078
the body and then it also has more

42
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,478
potency once once it's in the body you

43
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,879
know if you look at brain levels or

44
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,599
blood levels of these compounds that are

45
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,879
necessary to achieve their result you

46
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,038
need much less of it so more gets in and

47
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,118
you need much less maybe one of the

48
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,640
downsides is that CBD seems to last

49
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:14,439
longer in the body cbda you'll excrete

50
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,598
more quickly you might therefore have to

51
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:21,239
take it more often but um but a lot of

52
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,759
overlap there yeah and then kind of one

53
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,360
of the Nuggets that I picked up watching

54
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,039
your presentation from last year was you

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,800
showed some graphs showing that

56
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:34,280
cbda um is actually better absorbed when

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,640
it's part of a full plant extract that

58
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,360
that is that that I mean there's there's

59
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,719
findings and rodents you know we haven't

60
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,280
proven that for humans yet but based on

61
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,878
what we're seeing when people say you

62
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,800
know we get we taking these low Doses

63
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,719
and they're working really well and then

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,640
there is a human study that showed cbda

65
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,639
absorption through the gut was extremely

66
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,399
high it didn't test it like it did in

67
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,119
the rodent study on its own versus in

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,280
the in the context of a whole plant

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,280
extract but all the information we have

70
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,840
is pointing to to what you said that

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,158
essentially if you if there's a little

72
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,799
bit of THC or

73
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:10,399
CBG present with the cbda you might

74
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,680
absorb it or at least a rodent might

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,840
absorb like 15 times more of it with

76
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,519
just a little bit of THC or or CBG now

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,759
no none of us would have planned that

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,319
but I think a lot of us would have said

79
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,759
there is a pretty good chance that for

80
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,399
one reason or another taking this thing

81
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,399
in the context of the whole plant is

82
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,000
going to beat taking the isolated

83
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,560
compound you know and that that's the

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,080
lesson we've learned again and again and

85
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,680
again there's going to be exceptions to

86
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,480
that lesson you know in certain

87
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,799
situations but typically that is the

88
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,359
case and once in a while we know why

89
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,480
that's the case this is one of those

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,920
scenarios where we we think we know why

91
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,919
that's the

92
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:58,490
[Music]

93
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,519
