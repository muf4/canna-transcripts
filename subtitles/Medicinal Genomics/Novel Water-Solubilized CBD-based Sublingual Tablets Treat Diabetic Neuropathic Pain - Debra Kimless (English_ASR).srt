1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,359
good morning everybody thanks for

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,699
rushing out of the breaking coffee to

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,679
come spend a little bit of time with me

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,018
my name is Deborah kimless and I'm

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,879
really excited to share with you some

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,100
really interesting research that we're

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,118
doing through PG Pharma and some water

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,359
solubilized CBD and pea in addition to

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,219
me Consulting with PG Pharma and doing

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,859
exciting things I represent a bunch of

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,018
other companies as well I want to do a

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,179
shout out to Dr Mike from Entourage I

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,399
think he's talking tomorrow and a shout

14
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,939
out to the the sponsors here for

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,039
medicinal genomics RS by Therapeutics so

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,659
I'll go stop by their booth and talk to

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,460
them about some really cool stuff that

18
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,919
they're doing I also want to thank the

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,439
mckernan family

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,039
and Doug Kennedy for always welcoming me

21
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,899
to participate in this conference and to

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,120
create a safe space for everybody to

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,039
share their knowledge and really get to

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,439
understand things either within their

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,019
scope or outside of their scope in 2016

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,780
I was so proud I was there at Harvard

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,760
presenting a poster on using low-dose

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,560
cannabis oil to reduce or replace

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,400
opiates

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,618
in 2017 I shared some case reports using

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,200
low-dose cannabis oil for prostate

32
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,938
cancer and brain cancer and so why am I

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,900
taking this trip down memory lane when

34
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:24,059
we're really supposed to be talking

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,000
about diabetic neuropathic pain because

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,180
it's at this conference where Dr Raphael

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,118
michalum was sitting in front saying you

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,118
know there's a bunch of other molecules

39
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,739
out there cannabinoid like molecules I'm

40
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,560
not really sure why anybody doesn't look

41
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,599
at those and it hit me first the answer

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,460
was because you know they're not cool

43
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,618
they don't come from Cannabis and second

44
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,419
is because I'm not cool so I decided

45
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,420
that I would sort of explore what he was

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,420
suggesting so one of those was called

47
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,680
pea palmito ethanolamide and I did a

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,659
little bit of research played around

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,360
with it and then did what all scientists

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,520
do try it on themselves and then try it

51
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,060
on their friends and family and in 2018

52
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,159
I was able to present a little study it

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,039
was very lightweight in its robustness

54
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,780
as far as studies go but it really lends

55
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,659
some information and Credence to the

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,060
power of the combination of low-dose CBD

57
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,280
Pea in a sublingual tablet for the

58
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,580
treatment of mild to moderate pain and

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,900
we saw that it seemed to have worked or

60
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,099
my friends and family didn't want to

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,620
hurt my feelings

62
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:32,539
the folks at PG pharmace Steve goldner a

63
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,539
Visionary decided to take it to the FDA

64
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,238
and we all know that we need randomized

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,878
control you know trials that are blinded

66
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,620
and they have placebos and that was a

67
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,239
little bit scary for me so I said Steve

68
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,860
before we go ahead and jump into this

69
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,140
space let's figure out some dose

70
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,019
arranging studies and let's look at

71
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:56,059
whether or not there's some efficacy

72
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,060
so we did a single arm open trial

73
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,878
and so we looked at sublingual

74
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,339
cbda pea combination for the treatment

75
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,919
of painful diabetic neuropathic pain of

76
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,019
the feet why so specific because when

77
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,059
you go to the FDA they want an

78
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,920
indication specifically and after we had

79
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,878
our pre-ind meeting this is what we left

80
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,658
with

81
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:23,939
and so we looked at diabetics as a scope

82
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:25,500
for business because pure research is

83
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,680
great but does this make sense there's

84
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,620
over 37 million people in the US alone

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,140
with diabetes about a quarter 25 percent

86
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,658
of them or a quarter of them will end up

87
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,039
with painful diabetic neuropathic pain

88
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,560
of the feet

89
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,620
and it ends up being

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,439
a four plus billion dollar cost to

91
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,000
health care costs direct costs a year

92
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,878
so it seems to be something very

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,519
interesting to pursue there are already

94
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,039
some DEA FDA approved

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,519
medicines

96
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:02,219
is there a secret to this there it goes

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,120
and some are off label use some are FDA

98
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,799
use they all have variable consistencies

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,200
whether or efficacy as to whether

100
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,299
they're working or not there's a ton of

101
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,579
side effects from something mild to

102
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,858
nausea and insomnia to confusion to

103
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,079
suicidal ideation so we figured there's

104
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:23,039
got to be a better way

105
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,439
so we looked at CBD and pea they're both

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,960
uh you know very interesting lipids

107
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,180
Palmetto phenomide is endogenous to

108
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,579
humans and many plants sadly not the

109
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,100
cannabis plant as pointed out to me

110
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:37,740
again by my cousin Ethan Russo

111
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,759
um and CBD is of course a molecule of

112
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,500
Interest

113
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,720
especially since the passing of the farm

114
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,879
bill there were some studies looking at

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,460
these two molecules individually in

116
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,478
Mouse models for diabetic neuropathic

117
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:53,099
pain and you know multimodal cause

118
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,918
mechanisms of action but it seemed to

119
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,139
work and these are two Publications

120
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:01,560
supporting that so we we had a little

121
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,960
bit of proof and so they took steps they

122
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,939
meaning the formulators of PG Pharma

123
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,859
took steps in trying to improve the

124
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,399
bioavailability because these are fat

125
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:14,340
molecules so if CBD was complex with

126
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,319
cyclodextrin pea uh was Ultra micronized

127
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:19,099
and administered through sublingual

128
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,099
tablet

129
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,479
so again we did an open label study this

130
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,478
was dose controlled and was prospective

131
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,379
our endpoints were safety and efficacy

132
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,299
of course pain relief and then we wanted

133
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,038
to see what would happen with sleep and

134
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,960
anxiety

135
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,699
um

136
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,099
because those seem to be common side

137
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:45,360
effects when you have chronic pain so we

138
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:48,780
onboarded 31 participants 13 male 18

139
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,660
female they had to have an average seven

140
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:54,839
day NPR score so a Pain Scale score of

141
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,720
five or greater due to the their foot

142
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,299
pain we dosed them at 20 milligrams of

143
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,039
CBD plus 100 milligrams of pea three

144
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,360
times a day and we did this for three

145
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:05,639
weeks

146
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,860
and they were permitted to stay on their

147
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,478
pain meds as long as their Pain Scale

148
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,819
score before they were on boarded was

149
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,339
five or greater

150
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,839
and so interesting the pain responses so

151
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,219
if you look at the orange bars that's

152
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,659
the ones where the patients who continue

153
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,699
their medicines

154
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,139
for pain relief and the yellow ones are

155
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,360
the ones that never took it they just

156
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:27,180
sort of were sucking up their pain they

157
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,340
both had a very very similar starting

158
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,319
point for their Average mprs pain score

159
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:34,379
not statistically significantly

160
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,819
different from the two and then after

161
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,038
the trial

162
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,639
both of them reduced about the same

163
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:44,478
greater than three and a half points

164
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,478
it's pretty incredible

165
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,600
we also looked at their highest pain

166
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,819
scores again not statistically

167
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,460
significant difference although the

168
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:56,100
people on FDA and off-label use

169
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,439
medications at a higher average paying

170
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,919
scale score than those that did not take

171
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,600
any Medicaid pharmaceutical medication

172
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:06,359
and again they had a statistically

173
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,400
significant reduction in pain

174
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,280
so I find this incredibly exciting

175
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,638
especially for the next couple slides

176
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,219
too we did a hammy the Hamilton anxiety

177
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,780
score the higher the number the higher

178
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,560
the anxiety the lower the number the

179
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:21,959
better

180
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,240
again not a statistical significant

181
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,339
difference between those ahmeds and

182
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,800
those not all medications and again a

183
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,758
statistically significant reduction in

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,759
their Pain Scale score

185
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:37,379
same thing with sleep response we did

186
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index the

187
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,740
higher the number in this case the

188
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,780
better the sleep

189
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,699
so and again no difference really

190
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:47,038
statistically between the difference of

191
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,340
the people on medicines and those that

192
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,379
were not taking any and again

193
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,019
an improvement

194
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:58,978
but the coolest thing was no adverse

195
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:00,839
effects now granted nf31 it's small but

196
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:03,418
it really did inform us as to whether or

197
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,579
not we should pursue this and whether or

198
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,139
not you know we should this dosing is

199
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,139
correct

200
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,418
so we did the scariest of all

201
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,000
the longest you know eight months of my

202
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,318
life randomized double-blind

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,879
placebo-controlled trial

204
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,379
using

205
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,379
the sublingual tablets

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,579
or endpoints for similar pain anxiety

207
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,020
sleep and then patients Global

208
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,319
impression of change it's how they

209
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:38,038
perceive they responded to the treatment

210
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,120
so we onboarded 54 people that were

211
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:44,098
randomized either active or placebo

212
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,919
we did get them off all of their

213
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,420
medication which was crazy

214
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,458
um the average

215
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:52,860
um duration for people for suffering

216
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:54,419
with this pdpn was greater than seven

217
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,919
years so they've been dealing with this

218
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:59,699
for a very long time

219
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,500
and all of these these studies were done

220
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,959
during covid so all this was

221
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,559
decentralized remote on web-based

222
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,559
platforms

223
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,879
so they had to do a washout period if

224
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,518
they were on any medication including

225
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,379
cannabinoids they were allowed to take

226
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,139
rescue Medicine of their choice either

227
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:23,059
acetaminophen or Ibuprofen

228
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,059
and the treatment again was for 28 days

229
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,839
so the interesting thing pre-treatment

230
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:34,679
the average mprs score for both both

231
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:37,980
arms was 7.3 the CBD group The CBD

232
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,859
randomized group was 3.6

233
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,259
um I'm sorry um 7.19

234
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,659
the placebo group was 744 so no

235
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,600
statistical difference and then after

236
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:51,480
four weeks

237
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,659
post-treatment dropped to 3.63 and the

238
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,459
placebo grew plateaued at about 5.7 so

239
00:09:54,659 --> 00:10:00,559
they were statistically significant

240
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:03,419
reduction in pain in the treatment arm

241
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:07,639
same thing with the highest the highest

242
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:11,039
average was uh 8.74 for the CBD group

243
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,958
8.72 in the in the placebo group again

244
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,120
not a statistical difference in either

245
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,278
one of these groups pre-treatment and

246
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,060
then post-treatment a statistical

247
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:23,580
significant reduction in pain

248
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:27,359
4.93 in the CBD group and it plateaued

249
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,519
at 7.02 in the placebo arm

250
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,560
so I think this is incredibly exciting

251
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,659
but what I think is even more exciting

252
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,539
is what I like to say doesn't meet the

253
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:38,458
SOA test the SOA test means great you

254
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:42,059
have statistical significance but is it

255
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:45,599
meaningful to the to the patient so is

256
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:48,179
it clinically important

257
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,159
so it has a tremendous impact right for

258
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,859
us clinicians who are treating patients

259
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,059
we want to know great statistics what do

260
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,639
patient say

261
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:59,278
so the

262
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,919
mcid for pdpn of the fee believe in her

263
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,899
author is one using an NPR score is a

264
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,059
reduction in two so if you have a pain

265
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,759
scale score of eight and it goes down to

266
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:11,699
six patients actually recognize this

267
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:15,299
so the average change in this study in

268
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,420
this in this cohort the CBD group had a

269
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:21,659
reduction of minus 3.56 in their NPR

270
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:25,860
score versus the placebo placebo group

271
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:28,259
of only 1.74 so not only did it meet

272
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,919
statistical significance it meets the

273
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,919
SOA test

274
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,600
I should get extra minutes for this

275
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,778
clicker not working

276
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,600
interestingly the anxiety showed an

277
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:45,299
improvement in mcid but not was not a

278
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,700
statistical significance again I don't

279
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:50,338
know if r or this was not an anxious

280
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,940
Bunch this group had only mild to

281
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,760
moderate elevation and anxiety I think

282
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,040
our end might have been small or as what

283
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,559
you know Ethan Russo says small amounts

284
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:05,778
of CBD may not do anything for anxiety

285
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,778
so could be that reason as well

286
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,579
and sleep scale score same thing that

287
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,259
met the mcid requirement but was not

288
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:15,419
statistically significant I'd be

289
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:17,399
interested in seeing what a larger n

290
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:18,860
would look like with this treatment over

291
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,480
time

292
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,159
and the patient's Global impression of

293
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,800
change it's very interesting it's two

294
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:28,500
questions they look at you know activity

295
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:31,859
ability symptoms emotions overall

296
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,720
quality of life they look and say is it

297
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,120
better is it worse since treatment or it

298
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,160
really didn't matter and the people in

299
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,100
the treatment arm said yes they reported

300
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,539
a significant Improvement in all of

301
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,839
those scores

302
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:48,480
while on this on the medicine

303
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,320
and safety because at the end of the day

304
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,879
as a physician Do no harm right or try

305
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,940
to at least reduce it

306
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,879
in the safe in the CBD pea group there

307
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,920
were zero reported Adverse Events and

308
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,078
there is one case of abdominal distress

309
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,059
which led abdominal distress to me

310
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,500
because it was a placebo group and it

311
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,059
were blinded and I didn't know it until

312
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,958
I had a

313
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,958
check it at the end

314
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,579
so in summary for this

315
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,860
this is an incredible opportunity we've

316
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:23,159
been listening to exciting important

317
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,720
information and if you went to the uh to

318
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,120
the other group yesterday where they

319
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,040
were talking about we need more we need

320
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,778
more trials we need more research so

321
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,299
that people can get funding

322
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:35,578
these are the trials in research that

323
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,740
are important in that what people are

324
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:39,539
asking for so if there are any investors

325
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,639
out there or anybody who's interested in

326
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:43,500
Pharma development you know I put a

327
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,360
challenge to you to either you know

328
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,399
continue to invest in research like I'm

329
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,860
doing or come up to any of the companies

330
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,480
that are out there today you know if

331
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,579
this isn't exciting to you there's lots

332
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,899
of other cool stuff going on that this

333
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:57,059
is some of the things that you should be

334
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,100
looking for I mean I think at least in

335
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,619
this small group of people we've

336
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,480
demonstrated some efficacy with this

337
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,120
combination

338
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,399
but like as a nerd my favorite group The

339
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,360
Carpenters have said We've Only Just

340
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,620
Begun

341
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,440
and we then decided Well we you know PG

342
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,539
Pharma group that repackages this up in

343
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,880
a nice neat way

344
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:24,000
we think there should be smooth sailing

345
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:27,500
going to the FDA for for doing this

346
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,500
this is my backyard by the way

347
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,399
but there are always surprises when you

348
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,339
least expect it especially when dealing

349
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,019
with the FDA and so yes we are dealing

350
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,000
with lots of surprises we're answering

351
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,120
those questions a lot of the questions

352
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,559
require a lot of money so if anyone's

353
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,019
out there and excited about this and

354
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:50,239
want to participate this is our team of

355
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:53,159
robust uh smart scientists and chemists

356
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,500
and I thank you and if anybody has any

357
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,500
questions I'm willing hi Ethan

358
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,539
thanks for sharing

359
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,659
um my question has to do with the

360
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:10,500
reception you've had at FDA so combining

361
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:13,559
CBD or phytocannabinoid with pea and

362
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,320
endogenous and synthetic agent they must

363
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:19,319
consider this a combination medicine so

364
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,440
what are the problems what what are the

365
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:26,820
steps that they've made to go through uh

366
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,440
along the path towards uh acceptance so

367
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,740
excellent question

368
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,720
I wish you asked me that four years ago

369
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,299
when we went and had our pre-ind meeting

370
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,740
they did not mention anything

371
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:43,859
about that which was insane exactly but

372
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,560
when we submitted to openrind that was

373
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,919
the first question they asked and they

374
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:52,319
want to see a combination uh talk study

375
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,479
which is what our next steps have to be

376
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,278
in order to pull this through which is

377
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,659
not cheap

378
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,659
which is a shame

379
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,519
thank you so much for your work I'm

380
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,899
curious did I hear you correctly say

381
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,299
that you got them all off their

382
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:13,259
medications before starting this study

383
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:16,620
we we did we got them off of all of

384
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:18,838
their treatment for the pdpn not all of

385
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,959
their medicine so if they had issues

386
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,820
with diabetes or or right or wrong issue

387
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,338
or whatever they stayed on those meds so

388
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,940
you got them off like their Gaba the

389
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:30,660
gabapentinoids and the duloxetines and

390
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,220
amitriptylines and those types of things

391
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:34,559
you know how many of them went back to

392
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,519
that after this study I'm curious to

393
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,018
know

394
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,578
I don't know I didn't follow up with

395
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,019
that with that question that's

396
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:43,198
interesting I don't know congratulations

397
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:46,320
getting them off those meds thank you

398
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:49,258
as a fun fact our our protocol for the

399
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,600
FDA keeps patients on their on their

400
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,720
current medications as long as their NPR

401
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,879
score is five or greater

402
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,879
and that was a request to the FDA

403
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,439
any other questions

404
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:06,980
nope thank you for your time I

405
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,980
appreciate it
