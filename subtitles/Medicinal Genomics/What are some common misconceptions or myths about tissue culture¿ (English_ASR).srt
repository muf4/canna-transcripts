2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,519
what are some common misconceptions or

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,559
myths about tissue culture that you'd

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:24,518
like to

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:27,320
debunk um okay so I'm not sure if

6
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,038
they're common myths or the like but

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,839
there's a there's several questions that

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,000
the clients always

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,719
come come to me when I'm discussing this

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,960
so I don't know if it's a myth or if I'm

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,000
just getting a small sample size uh so I

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:46,719
I'll go with those sure uh one of one of

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,320
the concerns that um uh I've had several

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,039
Growers H specifically because of

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,960
regulatory threats they were concerned

16
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,640
okay so once we start doing this stuff

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,359
you're doing all the science things um

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,518
what's going to make H how how am I

19
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,600
going to be sure that what when when I

20
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,798
give you these plants they're going to

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,680
be like they're they're hemp right now

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,240
uh

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,400
but what if they go hot and I'm like do

24
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,879
they have a history of going hot well no

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,759
it's less than like it's less than 1%

26
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,560
okay

27
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,159
well are you going to make it into

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,280
marijuana and I'm

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,960
like no so like some of the uh things

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,400
that I I don't think several people

31
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,959
understand is when you're doing tissue

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,719
culture you are making an exact clone of

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:39,000
the mother the donor tissue um unless

34
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,640
you are doing genetic modification

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,438
specifically which is another step if

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,439
you just clone that process whatever I

37
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:51,239
it's whatever genetics it has is what

38
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,519
the daughter is going to have sure so

39
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:57,000
like it's not going to suddenly like

40
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,718
it's not a like

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,078
0.02% THC plant is not suddenly going to

42
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:07,158
go 20% just because it crossed the

43
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:10,598
threshold of my door right um so unless

44
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:14,080
we do a lot of extra heavy lifting to to

45
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:16,639
like insert things that's one thing um

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,200
another one is that they have a lot of

47
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:25,279
questions is whether or not um it will

48
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:29,959
impact the Grower's organic

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:33,039
certifications um which um that it's not

50
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,080
necessarily like a science myth but it's

51
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:39,799
like um it's something that is very much

52
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:43,319
so of of interest to the client

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:46,200
um what is organic or not is a

54
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,238
government regulation and tissue culture

55
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,799
does not impact your organic

56
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,200
certifications at all like it's apples

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,640
to aircraft

58
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,759
carriers so like it it would it would

59
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:59,318
have no more impact on your organic

60
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,239
certifications on whether or not you

61
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:03,679
used an electronic vehicle to transport

62
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,959
your cannabis versus like a gas powered

63
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,959
vehicle it's just we don't it doesn't

64
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,719
the regulations don't apply to us

65
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,799
because what we're doing we're only

66
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,439
like we only have the genetic

67
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,719
expressions of the plant that we begin

68
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,560
with and the the daughter is the exact

69
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:25,120
it's an exact clone of the mother so if

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,640
if you know once I hand it to you if you

71
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,080
continue to do your Organics it's still

72
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,598
organic you know I haven't I haven't

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,719
messed up with any of

74
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:38,399
your um those are the two that I always

75
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,959
get asked yeah um so that those I don't

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,560
know if they're myths but it's like

77
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,280
questions that the clients always have

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,280
so I thought I'd bring it up yeah

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:00,789
