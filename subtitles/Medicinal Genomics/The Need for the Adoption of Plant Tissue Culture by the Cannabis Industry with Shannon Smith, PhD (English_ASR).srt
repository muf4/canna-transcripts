those are available our guest today is

34
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,679
Dr Shannon Smith Shannon received his

35
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,399
PhD in molecular biosciences from Middle

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,040
Tennessee State University there his

37
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,799
research focused on plant biotechnology

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,360
with work in cannabis Panax and vidus

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,759
tissue culture and

40
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,118
manipulation this led to the development

41
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,519
of new and unique Technologies for the

42
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,840
production of both plants and secondary

43
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:06,158
metab aites he later founded Greenway

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,759
lab a plant biotechnology company that

45
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,560
collaborates with agricultural Partners

46
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,639
to implement plant biotech solutions to

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,719
Botanical challenges facing the modern

48
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,958
agricultural

49
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,919
industry during our conversation we

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,039
discussed the many advantages of using

51
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:25,598
tissue culture and cannabis

52
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,598
cultivation particularly for use in

53
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,359
propagation

54
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,878
cryopreservation and for store storage

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,400
protection and Reclamation of genetic

56
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:40,120
IP so without any further Ado please

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,620
enjoy my conversation with Dr Shannon

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:03:01,280

59
00:02:42,620 --> 00:03:01,280
[Music]

60
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,120
good morning Dr Smith thanks so much for

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,840
joining us on the

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,879
podcast uh thank you for the in

63
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,560
invitation excellent well I'm excited to

64
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:17,199
talk with you today about tissue culture

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,400
at caned 24 you're presenting a poster

66
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,719
about recent advances in plant tissue

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,360
culture that may solve three key

68
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,560
problems facing the Cannabis industry

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,319
but before we get into those I was

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,598
hoping you can give us an overview of

71
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,318
what tissue culture is and how it's

72
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:37,798
potentially revolutionizing the Cannabis

73
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:41,679
industry I'd be glad to um so tissue

74
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,920
culture is isn't of itself a sub um a

75
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,680
subdiscipline of plant

76
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,318
biotechnology um plant biotechnology is

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,920
just basically the science of using um

78
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,199
various techniques and understandings

79
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,078
that we've developed over time to either

80
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,158
make more plants or to investigate you

81
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,640
know the plant kingdom and specifically

82
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,519
tissue culture itself relies on a set of

83
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,158
evolutionary strategies that the plant

84
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,799
kingdom has conserved plants are by

85
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:16,000
their very nature sessile creatures that

86
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:19,478
is to say um more except for some key um

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,918
like exceptions uh plant tissue itself

88
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,800
can't move on its own like obviously

89
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,519
like pollen can move and there's certain

90
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,079
exceptions but as a whole plants can't

91
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,639
move which leads them to having to deal

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,439
with a threat that other like creatures

93
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,319
in the animal kingdom um they have to

94
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,439
have a different strategy for it if say

95
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,800
for instance a predator is coming after

96
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,478
like a gazelle or something gazelle can

97
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,319
just run if say for instance you and I

98
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,000
find an absolutely delicious AOC avocado

99
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:53,279
tree the avocado tree can't get up and

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,240
leave so what the plant has to do is and

101
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,319
what the on the conserved strategy is

102
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,918
that they have they have favored is

103
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,839
plant cells can be a little bit more

104
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,519
plastic in their expression so if say

105
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:10,319
for instance a plant is injured by

106
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:11,959
either a predator or disease or a pest

107
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,719
like say for instance something's chewed

108
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,519
on it or we've ripped off a section of

109
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,479
it

110
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:21,680
Etc the cells that are killed send a a

111
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,000
last gas message to the rest of the

112
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,800
cells and the plants in the environment

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
now this chemical message then tells the

114
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,160
plant cells that are remaining hey look

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,439
we've been injured so they start a

116
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,240
series of defensive strategies to

117
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,918
convert themselves into a undeveloped

118
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
tissue and then replace the tissues that

119
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,359
they

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,520
lose or and also with some of them it

121
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,520
tells them hey look we're under attack

122
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:54,279
from this threat you need to switch

123
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,719
production from this to this uh those

124
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:59,119
are two things uh in plant tissue

125
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,319
culture uh that are basically the key

126
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Concepts behind a lot of the expressions

127
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,160
of the technology that we use in

128
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,038
Industry so how how does the tissue

129
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,880
culture process sort of take advantage

130
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,959
of those

131
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,598
adaptations okay so with that um I've

132
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,879
got a a few

133
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:26,478
um I've I've got a few

134
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:30,000
sources so for a lot of

135
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:33,478
um this uh for a lot of these things if

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,038
the audience wishes to do a deep dive um

137
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:39,038
this is a review article that the

138
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:42,279
Canadian uh academic Community worked

139
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:45,120
together with um the Canadian cannabis

140
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,598
industry to look at uh tissue culture as

141
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,759
a whole and to justs like basically

142
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:52,759
here's a list of all of these various

143
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,800
strategies um it's a little dense and

144
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,319
it's a little big so but it it it's a

145
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,319
review article so it's very useful sure

146
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,280
um so

147
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,680
um with that a couple of the things that

148
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:10,598
you can do with it was um you can take

149
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:15,959
advantage of these uh various techniques

150
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:17,800
to either propagate tissues um to do um

151
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,239
long longer term

152
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,319
storage uh to try to select for a

153
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,038
certain Elite traits um say for instance

154
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,199
you you want a crop any or the fruit is

155
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:31,079
bigger or let's say for instance you're

156
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,560
making a um you're making a cannabis

157
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:37,478
line that produces a specific oil or

158
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
like produces a harder fiber you can

159
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:40,478
select for

160
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720
those

161
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,758
um you can do like I said you can do

162
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:50,080
long-term storage you can propagate and

163
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:52,280
you can um help guide um uh growth and

164
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,918
um breeding

165
00:07:52,279 --> 00:08:00,679
opportunities also uh there is um some

166
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:04,639
aspects of it that help um in disease

167
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,478
prevention and disease recovery because

168
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,960
again um we're leveraging the defense

169
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:12,758
strategies of the

170
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,079
plant and uh we can then actively select

171
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,759
like okay hey we have this situation so

172
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,158
let's specifically do this to deal with

173
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,199
this

174
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:24,839
problem right so could you walk us

175
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,598
through the process of of tissue

176
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:31,598
culture okay uh sure I'm going to give

177
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,120
you a very brass tax uh very basic

178
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,879
explanation of the tissue culture

179
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,959
technique and also I have some um images

180
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,200
from both our research and also some

181
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,199
cartoony ones that are a little bit

182
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,240
easier to see if like the screen small

183
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,600
like they're just watching it on their

184
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,879
phone so uh the basic T process of

185
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,879
tissue culture is first you do a

186
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:58,039
selection of of

187
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,078
materials that you select a plant and

188
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,958
you select the tissues in question

189
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:06,958
and then you

190
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,958
um then you take

191
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,920
and oh we'll pull up this cartoon so

192
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,039
you'll take um a cutting from those

193
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,759
tissues and sterilize them this is so

194
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,919
that you only are dealing with the

195
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,039
plants that you wish to deal with and

196
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,199
not of of any of the pathogens or any of

197
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,838
the other materials you're specifically

198
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,160
getting you're only selecting for like

199
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,680
say for instance you only want Maris

200
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:33,319
which is like Bud tissue or you only

201
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:37,039
want Leaf tissue so you just get that

202
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:40,920
and then you uh plate the tissues on a

203
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,879
media that has um these cell signaling

204
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,078
compounds that's those compounds that I

205
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,838
said beforehand were like the plant

206
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:49,639
saying hey look this happened you need

207
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:54,240
to do this so it grows

208
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:57,240
into um a mass of these Undeclared

209
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,240
majors of cells of like undifferentiated

210
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,200
tissue called callus and then you take

211
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,799
and you start giving it signals to say

212
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,640
like hey I want you to make roots or hey

213
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:10,519
I want you to make this compound or hey

214
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,039
I want you to make shoes and for in this

215
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,278
micropropagation

216
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,559
slide um what you're doing what this is

217
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,240
doing is we're taking uh some of the

218
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,078
body tissue converting it into callus

219
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,839
and then converting that tissue in that

220
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,599
callus while we're making the callus

221
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,399
grow over and over again we're also

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,839
telling it to make more plant babies now

223
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,278
you know that's the cartoon tun version

224
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,560
um these are some of the research

225
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,879
pictures they might they might not

226
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:41,278
necessarily be as clear so this is this

227
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:44,240
is an example where that upper left the

228
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:47,320
white tissue that is that was some

229
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,519
cuting that I took off of a a

230
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,519
economically threatened plant and we

231
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,679
grew a whole mass of that tissue

232
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,360
normally that amount of tissue would

233
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:00,799
take about two or three years to grow

234
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,680
because it's it it's it's a perennial

235
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,958
this was grown in months and then we

236
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:07,719
convert those tissues into a special

237
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:13,000
subtype and start making plant

238
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:15,839
babies uh that's one example um this is

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,879
um this is from our lab currently uh

240
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,120
we're working with um some of our

241
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,759
partners and working doing some work for

242
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,799
them so I took some cuting off of one of

243
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:30,720
their mother plants and then did a then

244
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,240
selected for tissues plated very small

245
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,519
tissues and these guys what they start

246
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,079
doing on that little jelly media that

247
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,959
they grow that they they're in they grow

248
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,559
they reproduce they grow they reproduce

249
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,599
they get bigger they reproduce and more

250
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,479
and more and then as they get to a

251
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,240
certain size they start throwing shoots

252
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,839
off and then we cut the shoots off and

253
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,480
you know propagate cut the shoots off

254
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,839
propagate until you get basic this is

255
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,759
probably a little bit more easy for the

256
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,760
the audience to see so so that's like

257
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,958
the base basic process of tissue

258
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,600
culture so how long does it take to get

259
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,039
to that sort of last stage that last

260
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,759
picture that you s showed there so um

261
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,679
with again

262
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:18,879
um

263
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:21,359
um to you know th this review has uh

264
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:25,720
several uh authors where they talk about

265
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,560
that um and from my work and also from

266
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,000
the work of Dr LA and their colleagues

267
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:35,359
you can get

268
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,759
um you can initiate a a callous culture

269
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,079
that that mass of cells normally in

270
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,439
about like 2 to 3 weeks and then they

271
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,319
start and that just starts growing and

272
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,760
growing and growing and for it varies

273
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,399
per plant but since we're you know since

274
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,600
we're talking about cannabis uh normally

275
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,519
that you start um the the shots and the

276
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,480
roots that the shots and the full

277
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,240
regenerated plants off of that callus um

278
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,560
they're ready to go into the ground

279
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,159
after a month mhm and the callous is

280
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,518
just sitting there throwing shoots

281
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,480
constantly and getting bigger throwing

282
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,560
shoots constantly so instead of say for

283
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,839
instance you having a mother room where

284
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:21,599
you have very tightly crowded plants and

285
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,639
um you have threats from like mold and

286
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,079
mildew and um fun and other fungal

287
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,278
contaminants and like spider

288
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:32,759
mites spidermites are a swear word to me

289
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:36,198
um cuz they just get in and they never

290
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:38,838
go away uh these are kept in a sterile

291
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:41,240
environment and in a much smaller space

292
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,199
and you can produce a larger amount of

293
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:48,360
plants for square

294
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:53,879
footage in a relatively quick

295
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:57,320
time so because for example um so for

296
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,639
traditional um cutting so like this is

297
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,680
like an image of you know so you have

298
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,000
your mother plant uh you cut it down to

299
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,879
the 9 Hells and then you get that amount

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,958
um

301
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,919
so with microor for instance you're only

302
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,359
taking a smaller portion but you can

303
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,159
that smaller portion like the little

304
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,120
circle area can produce the same

305
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:26,319
amount you know as

306
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,399
that so you don't necessarily need as

307
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,240
much you don't need as much square

308
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,759
footage to do the same job so if you

309
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,440
need to expand you you have that

310
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:40,440
available because no one's making more

311
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,720
Earth s right no and so when you were

312
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,120
describing the process I think it's kind

313
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,920
of clicked in my head maybe for the

314
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,399
first time is that so you're taking the

315
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,919
small piece of tissue you're putting it

316
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,480
in the media and it's sort of just

317
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:53,240
sitting there waiting for instructions

318
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,639
and then you're telling it what to do

319
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,039
with the hormones and everything that

320
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:01,278
you're adding to the culture right yeah

321
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:04,240
yeah see the the compounds in question

322
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,399
um they're cell signaling compounds some

323
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,079
of them are hormones some of them are

324
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,320
other things um but like it's literally

325
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,919
the chemical communication Network for

326
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,560
cells and it's their regul regulatory

327
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,120
system the cell is like hey I'm getting

328
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,799
food but no one's telling me what to do

329
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,039
and then you you have in the media you

330
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,120
have oh you need to do this and cell's

331
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:27,000
like cool and just starts doing it until

332
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,000
it's told to do something else excellent

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,799
okay so what are so you mentioned sort

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,480
of the the space saving advantage of

335
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:39,758
using uh culture for propagation um what

336
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,759
if any are other advantages to to this

337
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:47,560
method okay so again um our Canadian

338
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:53,039
colleagues go through and have pages of

339
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:56,919
of advantages um to ex to summarize uh

340
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,240
the sterility process um removes a great

341
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:02,639
deal of the threats that are currently

342
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,318
um in field grow and Greenhouse uh

343
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,079
growing operations So you you're less

344
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:10,278
likely to have to deal with certain

345
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,838
vectors coming in um you

346
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:16,838
can

347
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,920
produce um Elite clones that um so for

348
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,880
instance one of the strategies that you

349
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,240
have with um tissue culture is you start

350
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:27,078
opening

351
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,600
up um Avenues of long-term

352
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:31,879
storage um that is not normally

353
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,560
available using traditional methods the

354
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,360
the best traditional method for

355
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,559
long-term storage is normally converting

356
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,639
to seed and then getting it into a seed

357
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,119
Vault now that has a problem because

358
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:46,440
seeds will over time lose their

359
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,399
viability um so tisue culture opens up

360
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,079
both

361
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:54,639
cryopreservation and artificial seed

362
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:59,078
generation um and um artificial seed

363
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:02,159
pres preser uh uh preservation is uh

364
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:05,279
moderately long-term storage uh strategy

365
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,879
cryo pres preservation is a long-term

366
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,959
storage strategy um that is for a

367
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,880
situation where a client has like an

368
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,839
elite uh genome or Elite germplasm that

369
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,120
they are very concerned because they're

370
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,318
the only one in the world that has it

371
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,958
and it's only in this one location and

372
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:25,318
they're one fire or one hop Len virus or

373
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,919
one fungal contamination of the

374
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,839
extinguishment of that species or that

375
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,880
subset so what you can do is you can

376
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:35,959
convert it into tissue culture and then

377
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,280
um do a cryopreservation which is a

378
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,720
really quick

379
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,759
freeze and you can go store that

380
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,200
longterm off

381
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:47,119
site um and that allows to where you

382
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,840
don't have all your eggs in one

383
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,599
basket and then at a later date you can

384
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:55,079
bring that tissue back up and since it's

385
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:58,798
very plastic and convert you can then

386
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:00,199
put it on tissue plated tissues and um

387
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,759
grow it up and then start you know

388
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,038
having the cow start throwing shoes

389
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:09,279
again and just regenerate from there um

390
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:12,919
it also allows op breeding opportunities

391
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:16,519
uh genetic modification and um

392
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:18,919
compound um compound modification where

393
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,440
you can tell the plant specifically

394
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:25,400
since since you were telling it what to

395
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,960
do you can use techniques to say hey I

396
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,840
don't necessarily want you say like say

397
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,519
for instance hyp pathetically you have a

398
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,480
plant that produces uh something that

399
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:38,639
interacts with the endoc canabo system

400
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,640
but one of the compounds is uh legally

401
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,720
um

402
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,280
dubious so you can say for instance

403
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,440
suppress the uh the the compound that

404
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,240
could possibly get the grower in trouble

405
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,679
while upregulating the compound that

406
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,720
they're actually growing the plant for

407
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,600
so you that you can stay in a

408
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,960
hypothetical

409
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,798
situation um of a plant that has one

410
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,840
compound that is legally regulated while

411
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,918
the other ones are perfectly

412
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,199
fine you can then I I'll use tissue

413
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,280
culture techniques to make sure that

414
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,400
your grow doesn't go

415
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,079
hot and those are just some go ahead so

416
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,880
explain that a bit more how how does the

417
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:20,759
tissue culture process allow you to sort

418
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,360
of you know regulate those genes okay so

419
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,879
uh the again this is tissue culture

420
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,439
going this this is going back into the

421
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,600
whole faction that this is plants

422
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,200
conserve defensive strategy

423
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:35,558
IES um they there are and it tells the

424
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,279
plants to do you know like hey I need to

425
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:39,200
grow this hey I need to grow this the

426
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,399
secondary metabolites are defense

427
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,038
compounds they are not grown for the for

428
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,038
our benefit even though we can take

429
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,640
advantage of it they're actually grown

430
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:53,200
to end us it's to be poisonous it's just

431
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,759
that in like with all things the poison

432
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,960
is in the dose um often times those

433
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,640
things that are compounds that are risky

434
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:05,000
or poisonous to an organism at lower

435
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,880
levels can lower INF inflammation stop

436
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,480
like you know you know redirect cells to

437
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,679
where like immune cells are no longer

438
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,240
attacking their own body so on so

439
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,798
forth um

440
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,558
so for plant tissue culture and for the

441
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:25,960
various biotechnological things you can

442
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:28,158
we know what tells the plant to go

443
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,798
produce these compounds more because the

444
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,280
compounds are being produced in response

445
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:34,359
to a threat you trick it into thinking

446
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,720
it has this particular type of

447
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:40,158
threat and it makes a particular type of

448
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,038
compound well it doesn't at the end of

449
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,440
the day it only has a certain B budget

450
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:48,519
of sugar so it has to take it from

451
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,320
somewhere so if that you push something

452
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:54,319
up something else has to go

453
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:58,599
down and with these you can use these

454
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:01,240
techniques to say for instance um take

455
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:04,158
an elite germ plasm that produces a lot

456
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,798
of of a certain oil and say hey produce

457
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,760
more of this because you're under this

458
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,200
attack when in fact it's not so it's not

459
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,679
taking the damage that would normally

460
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,759
cause it and cause it to produce less

461
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,278
tissues you're just telling it to

462
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,079
produce more of the oil and it's still

463
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:21,278
keeping the same amount of

464
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:24,399
tissue so how does that translate once

465
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:26,159
you put the plant um you know into soil

466
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,159
or some other media you actually grow it

467
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,080
as a plant or are you just keeping it in

468
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,159
tissue

469
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:34,119
culture so there's a couple different

470
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,240
strategies for for that uh one of the

471
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:42,319
ways um that you can do is you can grow

472
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,759
it in a you can grow it in a um callous

473
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,278
suspension culture to where you just

474
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,679
have a slurry of cells and it's just

475
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:49,038
producing this compound over and over

476
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:52,320
again but what specifically I was

477
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:54,558
discussing is um a technique that I and

478
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:58,200
some of my colleagues developed where we

479
00:21:54,558 --> 00:22:00,000
can hijack that cell signaling pathway

480
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,558
in plants that are already in say for

481
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,759
instance the hydroponic system so

482
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:05,798
they're already plants they're already

483
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,319
doing things and we just use the

484
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,639
technology that is currently that

485
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,759
Growers are currently using for

486
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,799
propagation we just say hey um give this

487
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:17,440
cell signaling compound under this

488
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:20,918
dosage to the subject at these key

489
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,200
points of development and then it will

490
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:27,559
switch over and start is like oh I'm in

491
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,240
a environment that has this threat so I

492
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:32,200
will respond according accordingly so

493
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,798
they don't have you don't have to have

494
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,080
it in tissue culture for for the client

495
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:39,599
um you just we can leverage uh the

496
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,319
defense strategies of the

497
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,798
plant and have them use the technology

498
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,278
that they're already used to yeah so the

499
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,038
same concept of when we were talking

500
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:51,440
about earlier of you know using the

501
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,919
compounds or hormones in the petri dish

502
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,840
to send signals to the plant you can

503
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,600
actually do that in the hydroponic

504
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,959
system like through you know the the

505
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,439
water and nutrients that you're giving

506
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,919
it to produce the same

507
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:09,640
effect yeah it's just a it's just a much

508
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:12,000
larger petri dish excellent all right um

509
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,320
so what are some of the most significant

510
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,640
uh I'm sorry that is the wrong question

511
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:20,119
um it's fine what are some common

512
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,120
misconceptions or myths about tissue

513
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:27,038
culture that you'd like to

514
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:29,879
debunk um okay so I'm not sure if

515
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,599
they're common myths or the like but

516
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,400
there's a there's several questions that

517
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,119
the clients always come come to me when

518
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,038
I'm discussing this so I don't know if

519
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:41,158
it's a myth or if I'm just getting a

520
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:45,359
small sample size uh so I I'll go with

521
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:50,640
those sure uh one of one of the concerns

522
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:52,558
that um uh I've had several Growers H

523
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,278
specifically because of regulatory

524
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,918
threats they were concerned okay so once

525
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,558
we start doing this stuff you're doing

526
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,679
all the science things um what's going

527
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,798
to make how how am I going to be sure

528
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,200
that what when when I give you these

529
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:09,278
plants they're going to be like they're

530
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:13,840
they're hemp right now uh

531
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:16,798
but what if they go hot and I'm like do

532
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:19,480
they have a history of going hot well no

533
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,440
it it's less than like it's less than 1%

534
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,120
okay

535
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,720
well are you going to make it into

536
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,479
marijuana and I'm

537
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,038
like no so like some of the uh things

538
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,640
things that I I don't think several

539
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:34,720
people understand is when you're doing

540
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,600
tissue culture you are making an exact

541
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,558
clone of the mother the donor tissue um

542
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:44,199
unless you doing genetic modification

543
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:48,038
specifically which is another step if

544
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:51,000
you just clone that process whatever I

545
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:53,798
it's whatever genetics it has is what

546
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,079
the daughter is going to have sure so

547
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:59,079
like it's not going to suddenly like

548
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:02,240
it's not a like point

549
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:04,599
02 per THC plant is not suddenly going

550
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,679
to go 20% just because it crossed the

551
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:13,158
threshold of my door right um so unless

552
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,600
we do a lot of extra heavy lifting to to

553
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:19,200
like insert things that's one thing um

554
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:23,759
another one is that they have a lot of

555
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:29,159
questions is whether or not um it will

556
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:32,919
impact the grower organic certifications

557
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:36,600
um which um that it's not necessarily

558
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:38,720
like a science myth but it's like um it

559
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:42,359
it's something that is very much so of

560
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,839
of interest to the client

561
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:48,719
um what is organic or not is a

562
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,759
government regulation and tissue culture

563
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,319
does not impact your organic

564
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,720
certifications at all like it's apples

565
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,319
to aircraft

566
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,319
carriers so like it it would it would

567
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,879
have no more impact on your organic

568
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,839
certifications on whether or not you

569
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,200
used an electronic vehicle to transport

570
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,519
your cannabis versus like a gas powered

571
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,480
vehicle it's just we don't it doesn't

572
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:14,278
the regulations don't apply to us

573
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,360
because what we're doing we're only

574
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,000
like we only have the genetic

575
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,359
expressions of the plant that we begin

576
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,119
with and the the daughter is the exact

577
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,678
it's an exact clone of the mother so if

578
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,239
if you know once I hand it to you if you

579
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,679
continue to your Organics it's still

580
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,240
organic you know I haven't I haven't

581
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,320
messed up with any of

582
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,200
your um those are the two that I always

583
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:43,038
get asked yeah um so I don't know if

584
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,440
they're myths but it's like questions

585
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,519
that the clients always have so I

586
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,880
thought I'd bring it up yeah no awesome

587
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,720
and that that brings up another question

588
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,039
too so when you are working with a

589
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,679
client so we talked about the different

590
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:56,200
applications of tissue culture whether

591
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,720
it's propagation preservation

592
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,840
remediation or um sort of genetic

593
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,960
modification so what is like the most

594
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:04,599
common application that you're using

595
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,798
with your

596
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:11,519
clients um so with some of that I'm

597
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:16,679
going I I need to be um a little bit um

598
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:19,158
Cy um in the sense um I can't say what

599
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm doing with my clients but what I

600
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,159
because of ndas sure just like sort of

601
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,080
in general in general there's a couple

602
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:31,039
different things that the clients are

603
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:35,038
all that are always asking for um the

604
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:38,359
three big ones would be uh plant

605
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,558
propagation um and and and this is also

606
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:44,479
probably I think this is also probably

607
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:47,519
like industrywide for tissue um plant

608
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,319
propagation um see

609
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:56,240
here um storage for safety because of

610
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:58,879
the various um um disease outbreaks and

611
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,440
some fires that happened

612
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,240
uh last year in certain States uh some

613
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,038
of the Growers lost some of their crops

614
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,839
uh due to

615
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:12,119
wildfires so they they need some form of

616
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:15,439
like um third party

617
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:19,278
preservations uh so the propagation

618
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,679
preservations and um disease prevention

619
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,278
those would be the three things that the

620
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:27,440
industry as a whole very much so is is

621
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:29,720
very interested in and that's because of

622
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,399
the way that tissue culture

623
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,038
works you

624
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:37,278
know there are solutions for for the

625
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:39,319
client's problems excellent and now

626
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,759
interest in general for tissue culture

627
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:46,678
even awareness is that growing in your

628
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:50,480
opinion growing very slowly um interest

629
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:53,798
interest High understanding um there's a

630
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,599
barrier to entry uh so they they they

631
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:58,839
want to know they hear the term but they

632
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:01,798
they want to know what it is but um they

633
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:05,879
don't have access so things like this

634
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:08,839
podcast is uh very helpful for for them

635
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:12,120
um and it's not the Growers or the

636
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:15,278
industry's fault um agricultureal as a

637
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,439
whole has has very wholly adopted plant

638
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:18,720
biotechnology and tissue culture for

639
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,600
their production methods and various

640
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,880
other things um but due to regulatory

641
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:28,158
restraints um cannabis has has been a

642
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,720
lagging the Cannabis industry has lagged

643
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,799
behind it's not their fault um there's

644
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,200
barriers to getting that information

645
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:38,000
tuned from and uh tuned from the

646
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,840
scientific community so yeah uh things

647
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,278
like canmed um and the various other

648
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,959
cons are starting to you know clients

649
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:47,839
are starting to come it's like who do I

650
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,919
talk to in the industry who do I talk to

651
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:54,558
in Academia I I don't know and so these

652
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,919
events yeah there is a growing interest

653
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,798
um and a

654
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,880
growing understanding but we're due to

655
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:04,558
several of the regulatory roadblocks um

656
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,120
the Cannabis industry is having to play

657
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:07,639
catchup from the rest of the

658
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,079
Agricultural

659
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,240
Community okay so I guess with that in

660
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,319
mind are there certain things I mean I

661
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,079
guess now here's a platform that you

662
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:20,839
wish Growers Growers I'm sorry let me

663
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:22,398
let me start over so with that in mind

664
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,240
are there certain things that you wish

665
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,678
Growers knew about tissue culture um

666
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,120
that they might not have a good

667
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:33,840
understanding of right now

668
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:37,839
um yes um there's several of the um with

669
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:42,398
the ongoing um changes that they're

670
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:46,879
facing um from a biological perspective

671
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:48,918
um in my region uh our rainy our rains

672
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,960
are coming in different time periods uh

673
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:55,440
our Winters are not as cold so um pests

674
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,558
and threats and pathogens that weren't a

675
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,519
problem in my region are suddenly

676
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:04,879
becoming a problem um and uh Industries

677
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,359
are having to play catchup well for

678
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,320
several of these problems that are that

679
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,839
are future facing because farmers and

680
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,759
agricultural they have to drive well

681
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:18,199
ahead of the hood of their car so like

682
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,558
the clients right now you know even

683
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,480
though it's like 2024 and it's just

684
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:26,638
spring agriculture is like okay we've

685
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,159
got 2024 what are we doing in 2025 what

686
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:31,199
are we doing in 2026 how how are we

687
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,278
going to be dealing with that um so with

688
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,159
these problems that they the future

689
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:40,079
problems um plant tissue culture options

690
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:44,080
um are available to help future proof

691
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:48,038
you uh you can help work you can you

692
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:52,158
know store your uh store your germ plasm

693
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:56,158
you can uh produ you can actually have a

694
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:59,080
facility built um at your location and

695
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,519
be trained and have to where through

696
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:06,359
Partnerships you can do your own tissue

697
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:10,159
culture work and like you um start to

698
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:13,319
retire certain um aspects of your

699
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,159
production that are high risk for

700
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:18,599
infection um or bottlenecks for

701
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,120
production those would be like you

702
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,319
know the the there's some problems that

703
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,079
you guys are facing and they're only

704
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:28,158
going to get more complicated so it's

705
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:31,678
it's the quicker you adapt and adopt the

706
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,240
the new strategies that your colleagues

707
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,360
over in the other the rest of the

708
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,079
Agricultural fields are doing um the

709
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,719
safer you're going to be in the more

710
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:45,000
long term that we can help make you be

711
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:48,159
as a company and as a client right now

712
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,960
is cost a barrier or a perceived

713
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:54,600
barrier cost um startups costs can be a

714
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,079
perceived barrier um depending on what

715
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,959
you're doing um if you're if you're

716
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:02,119
trying to if a client is trying to build

717
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,759
a full fully functional cloning

718
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,599
facility

719
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:11,558
um that is obviously if you're doing

720
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:16,278
that um that's going to be a capital

721
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:19,200
intensive but you can part there are

722
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:21,599
companies you know slight you know

723
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,080
slight self-plug you know my company for

724
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:28,000
instance um that um they will they you

725
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:31,319
can partner with them and uh you can

726
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,720
work kind of a situation where you know

727
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,720
you go havies in on the work and you

728
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,558
know over time maybe convert a facility

729
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,278
a lot of individuals don't realize that

730
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,720
you don't necessarily have to build this

731
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:45,798
facility from the ground up sometimes uh

732
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:50,278
you can just convert a section and um

733
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:56,278
the for instance B

734
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:59,558
um th this um review goes into um where

735
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:03,278
in with several of the can industry in

736
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:05,839
Canada uh they were able to flip and

737
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,919
convert originally they thought like hey

738
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,159
yeah this is a you know high cost

739
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,320
barrier to entry but they were able to

740
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,559
actually

741
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:18,960
convert and um it ended up being a cost

742
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:20,440
saving method and they were able to

743
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,720
redirect that Capital into other

744
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,800
Ventures and expand that way so yeah um

745
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,480
it is a

746
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,320
perceived uh it is a perceived barrier

747
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,119
but it is not necessarily always as

748
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,800
accurate as people believe it is it's

749
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,000
not as it's not as much of a barrier as

750
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,440
people think yeah they just don't they

751
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,800
just don't have the technology or the

752
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,480
experience and you can't blame them for

753
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,399
that yeah and that was going to be my

754
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,000
next question is you

755
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,159
know can the average cultivator do they

756
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,079
have the skills necessary to be able to

757
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,000
do tissue culture or is that a very kind

758
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,240
of

759
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,679
specific um set of skills that you need

760
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,639
to sort of hire for or or consult with a

761
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,639
company

762
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,480
um that's a hard question to answer

763
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,280
because it depends on uh the

764
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,400
cultivator um you can be

765
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:15,519
trained um if you are good enough to

766
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:19,639
handle the In-N-Outs of agronomy plant

767
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:22,000
breeding running a greenhouse handling

768
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:24,078
um various fertilizers and vertiga

769
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,119
systems being able to handle all of

770
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,640
those techniques that's that's a lot of

771
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,960
that's a lot of experience and Technical

772
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:37,879
knowhow if you have the skill set to do

773
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:40,838
that you can learn um you can also hire

774
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:45,680
individuals coming out of Academia uh

775
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:48,239
there are a a slew of good programs for

776
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:51,519
where the and here's one thing that is a

777
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,919
disconnect and something that I I I want

778
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,280
to have like tell the agricultural

779
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,119
Community um the agricultural Community

780
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,079
is like hey look we're looking we're

781
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:02,920
trying to find these people that have

782
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,280
these skill sets and Academia is like

783
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,039
we're producing these people that have

784
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,760
these skill sets I wish I could find a

785
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:13,838
job with these skill sets

786
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,800
um that's uh there's this like this so

787
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:19,000
close so

788
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,200
close so like yeah you can uh you can

789
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,920
hire individuals um but like a

790
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,879
technician you you don't need

791
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,159
necessarily to get a um PhD you

792
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,400
technicians that are like Bachelors you

793
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:38,358
know lab tech lab heads that can be

794
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:42,760
Masters those those levels of Education

795
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:44,199
are um easily able to handle it but also

796
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,640
you can be

797
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:49,759
trained yeah so like if you if you can

798
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,118
handle a vertiga system you can handle a

799
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,040
bsl2

800
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,039
cabinet yeah no and that's one great

801
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:58,039
thing about about cannabis Growers and

802
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,679
probably Growers and and farmers General

803
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:04,239
is they they have to be a little bit of

804
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:05,759
a jack of all trades and um you know be

805
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,838
familiar with all different systems and

806
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,480
sort of create their own solutions to

807
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:13,318
problems too so um yeah for example um

808
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,358
one of the partners I have he's an

809
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:21,400
agronomist uh James Clint Palmer um he's

810
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:25,358
an agronomist um very much so breeds his

811
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,119
own uh cannabis lines great Greenhouse

812
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:32,759
guy but he also knows how to use an hplc

813
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:35,000
mpect and he has like a a an an an

814
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,640
analyzer in like one of his you know

815
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,559
closets that he uses to analyze the

816
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,759
chemical profile of the plants that he's

817
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,920
that he's breeding so like the Jack of

818
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,960
all trades it's like you would if you

819
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,440
know if you ever meet Clint which I

820
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,599
actually do recommend he's great guy and

821
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,079
very knowledgeable when it comes to

822
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,599
plant braiding um you would not you

823
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,480
would be like you have a what where

824
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,960
right it's like oh yeah let's just go

825
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,079
run an analysis it'll be fine and it's

826
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,280
like so yeah for so that's just an

827
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,640
example of an

828
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,599
agronomist who a lot of people if I say

829
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:12,598
hlc mpect they'll they'll be like so are

830
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,280
we doing CSI or something you know so

831
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,400
yeah like they can

832
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,000
learn excellent all right so so winding

833
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,119
down here I was wondering if you could

834
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,719
discuss any ongoing research or

835
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,280
collaborations that you're currently

836
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,118
involved with uh related to cannabis

837
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,599
tissue

838
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:34,960
culture um I can very

839
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:40,960
vaguely the lawyer slight suddenly

840
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:45,960
appearing in my office NDA um so we are

841
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:49,400
working with uh individuals to um uh

842
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,838
breed some of they they have some very

843
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,599
interesting germ plasm that produces

844
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:58,639
some very interesting traits and they

845
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:01,760
want to make a lot of it um there was

846
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:05,118
again this is a little bit more um and I

847
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,839
have to be very careful um not only for

848
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,800
my own legal reasons but because you

849
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:12,279
know this is

850
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,880
regulatory uh but in the region that I'm

851
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,760
in um are last two seasons have been

852
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,000
very

853
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,599
rough uh on on the the agricultural as a

854
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,559
whole but um several of the Cannabis

855
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,119
Growers who are growing completely legal

856
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,799
h

857
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,039
suddenly went hot and they only had hemp

858
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,599
license so they had to lose my comment

859
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,880
about like you have to they have to

860
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,079
drive their car several car car hoods in

861
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,119
advance well a tree just jumped out in

862
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:47,400
front of them so uh we're developing

863
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:50,920
Technologies to specifically make it to

864
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:55,760
where um they can lessen their risk of

865
00:39:50,920 --> 00:40:00,680
it going uh out of control just from um

866
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:05,599
just from environmental stressors wow um

867
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:07,719
yeah so to you know developing those um

868
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,119
when I get permission to I'd love to

869
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:10,679
show you the curves that we're that

870
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,760
we're getting in our results they're

871
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:17,598
very they're very smexy uh it's it's

872
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,880
very very very nice plots and Excel

873
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,559
spreadsheets um so is actually

874
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,160
environmental factors sort of messed

875
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:29,279
with the cannabinoid

876
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:32,000
ratios oh yes oh very much so yes canabo

877
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,359
ratios are a defense strategy for the

878
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,480
plant and the plant will try to defend

879
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:38,279
itself versus environmental stressers

880
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,519
just as much as it will defend itself

881
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:45,280
from versus

882
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:47,880
um uh versus like chewing damage or you

883
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,519
know various other predatory damage so

884
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:54,039
yes very much so um so working on

885
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:57,358
something to make it to where they can

886
00:40:54,039 --> 00:41:00,639
future proof their uh their crops versus

887
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:05,679
you know these environmental threats um

888
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:08,000
and there's also not cannabis related um

889
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:12,000
but it's tissue culture related there

890
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,719
are certain um companies that produce um

891
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,480
I I'm pretty sure you've heard the term

892
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:17,919
superfood you know what I'm talking

893
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,079
about with that it's it's a it's a food

894
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,760
that happens to have like a massive

895
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:28,760
amount of something like a vitamin C or

896
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:31,440
something um so we're working um with

897
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:36,760
some people with some

898
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:40,159
plants um to make their Elite um

899
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,599
varieties more Elite like more

900
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:49,318
concentrated so that they can go hey

901
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:51,480
look here um um we're producing um I'm

902
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:54,440
going to say we're producing a

903
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,800
tangerine um that has like more vitamin

904
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:02,039
C than you could ever imagine um editors

905
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,839
not we're not working with t um but like

906
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,440
using that as an example so like that's

907
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:10,759
some of the ongoing work that we have

908
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,920
excellent so and then finally uh I know

909

citations um so

923
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,960
for um if they're wanting to more learn

924
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:52,240
more about cryopreservation

925
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:56,440
techniques um I'm going to pull up here

926
00:42:52,239 --> 00:43:00,479
are two um articles one is in nature and

927
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,720
the other one is in plants um those go

928
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,800
into detail about cryo

929
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:09,598
preservation um specifically

930
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:13,400
also um you can also for understanding

931
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,480
how um tissue culture is used to deal

932
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:20,760
with viral threats

933
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,119
um here is here are two articles that

934
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,680
they can go into a deeper dive uh Under

935
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,119
Siege the virus control and plant M

936
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:29,440
stems and progyny and the elimination of

937
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,838
hot lat vroid from hot plants by Cold

938
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,318
treatment those go with um several uh

939
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,920
the the techniques and the explanation

940
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:42,519
of how to do

941
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,039
that um so those are some more U primary

instance discussing say like hey look we

952
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,480
would like to do some tissue culture or

953
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,079
hey look we're interested in maybe doing

954
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,480
building a tissue culture facility and

955
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,119
expanding in an area or hey hey can we

956
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,838
talk about you know

957
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:30,400
preserving um we can be reached out um
