1
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:09,279
thank you very much to the

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,199
10 people that stayed to the end of the

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,279
the conference

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,969
it's funny that stacy even when she's

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,559
not here she's taking time off my talks

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,519
[Laughter]

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,320
she have

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,320
this ability to overcome me always

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,160
the only thing that she wasn't funny as

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
usual so i'm i'm more relaxed

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,358
and

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,960
she's amazing she's

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,600
top scientist

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,960
and i admire her work

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,359
and by saying that hi if somebody

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,679
don't know me how many of you were

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,840
yesterday in the talk how much overlap i

18
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,840
have

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,039
good

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,039
i don't see anything but good

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,198
so i tried

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,480
since i gave a talk yesterday i tried to

23
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,399
change part of that not too much

24
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,319
and

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,239
so i'm sorry for the people that were

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,319
yesterday and and

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,519
so part of the things but i'm trying to

28
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,798
show

29
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,879
the same

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
path or things that i believe but in in

31
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,839
a different way

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,600
so

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,359
if somebody doesn't know me i'm

34
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,919
professor of the technion which is the

35
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,319
technology institute of israel i of also

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,719
have a company altogether we're around

37
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,639
90 scientists that's working on this

38
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,118
project that i'm show you

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,159
which is mainly cannabis my lab is also

40
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,280
doing algae work like plant biology in

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,600
general

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
and and

43
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,280
and

44
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,599
the the the fact that this is my first

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,560
site meaning that they didn't put the

46
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:50,719
right uh

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,719
the newest version that i gave him

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
but it's

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,680
that we will manage that also

50
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:02,639
it's fine so let me see

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,640
yeah no i'm fine i'm fine okay so

52
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,359
i will go that way

53
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,598
when i established my lab

54
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,520
eight years ago i started to work with i

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,560
have a phd in molecular and plant

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,640
biology and i did postdoc in cancer

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,598
research when i start my established my

58
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,839
lab i want to create kind of

59
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:24,878
multi-disciplinary lab that will work on

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
a plant that affecting cancer one of the

61
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,679
plants

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,439
that were there outside the mainly by a

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,239
work by emanuel guzman and christian

64
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,239
sanchez was this plant

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,439
and and i we started to work with that

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,800
and we got really good results

67
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,439
and

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,599
going further further seven years first

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,159
of all most of my work and my students

70
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,639
working on this plant but we create a

71
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,680
multi-disciplinary disciplinary lab

72
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,119
doing

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,040
everything from extraction to analyzing

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
the molecules understanding how they

75
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,158
affect

76
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,518
and the reason for that it's not that i

77
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,318
chose that

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,439
this is my license from the israeli

79
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,079
government to do a cannabis research

80
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,120
this is my name professor mary david my

81
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,440
a faculty of biology if there is

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,239
somebody here that don't know to read

83
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,840
hebrew i'm translating

84
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,280
even though you know the bible and

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
everything you should but

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,200
so this is my name professor mahiri this

87
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:33,199
is the lies the number of the license r

88
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:36,000
for research zero zero zero one okay

89
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,399
so we have rafi mashullah that in 65

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,680
started work with cannabis didn't ask

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,799
for license just went and take a

92
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,680
cannabis

93
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,120
in 2007 the cannabis moved to the health

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,719
care 2014 i was the first one to apply

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,480
for a license

96
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,438
so no collaboration

97
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,119
i have a license to work in room 401

98
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,878
and that's it if i'm going to the

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,879
microscope in the first floor i'm a

100
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:05,438
criminal and i'm a criminal okay

101
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,719
but for that i didn't have

102
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,479
any choice

103
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,959
you can send it to the chemistry

104
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,919
department to check it you can't use

105
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,720
your friend lcms to do metabolomics

106
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,519
everything needs to be in-house and this

107
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,320
is the reason my lab become a lab that

108
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,639
actually had to do everything i have a

109
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,839
lot of criticism in-house about that

110
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,199
that i'm doing everything and

111
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,560
multidisciplinary but it's not my fault

112
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,960
this plant fault okay

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
he multi-disciplinary it's multimedia

114
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,000
right

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,600
so cannabis

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,040
as you all know oh no sorry yeah

117
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
i'm professor of the technology

118
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,639
institute of israel and

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,080
this is how it looks like i never

120
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,759
succeed to work with this kind of things

121
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,159
so cannabis and i gave that as an

122
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,199
example yesterday you know

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,759
people don't understand that cannabis is

124
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,478
actually not really

125
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,120
growing in the nature like as as a plant

126
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,199
biology there is no

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,199
reason for this plant

128
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,319
to create 20 30 35

129
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,800
in his flowers of cannabinoids we have

130
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,839
many plants that produce cannabinoids

131
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,160
they will produce 0.1 0.2 this is

132
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,159
lipophilic very sticky

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,720
molecules when the pollen this there

134
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,840
there is a male and a female the wind is

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,919
pollinated by the wind the pollen is

136
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,038
flying and is attaching

137
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,439
sticking

138
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:43,439
by this molecule to the flower but he

139
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,279
needs 0.1 0.3 to the reason

140
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,000
we have such an amount that because

141
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:51,599
people did breathing for thousands of

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,680
years with this plant and create

143
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,439
something like we did with dogs like

144
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,560
this a wolf

145
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,079
and this is you know a wolf dog very

146
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,800
similar

147
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,639
but

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,639
how do the hell we go reach this one

149
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,280
this is cannabis in to my opinion okay

150
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,479
i'm teaching in genetics in in you know

151
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,800
in the medical school and i'm teaching

152
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,478
mutations and said yeah mutation

153
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,560
changing and then showing this and said

154
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,560
how the hell we reach that one okay

155
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,519
so

156
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,839
this is cannabis and cannabis harboring

157
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,758
a lot of these molecules

158
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,359
phytocannabinoids

159
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,240
and fetal cannabinoids were discovered

160
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,919
by rafi mashup and i wanted to to to say

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,120
any word about that

162
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,560
but they're

163
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,399
affecting our endocannabinoid system and

164
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,918
again i spoke about that yesterday the

165
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,359
endocannabinoid system is way wider that

166
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,439
i think

167
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,800
90 percent of the audience here and it's

168
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,240
not a lot

169
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,639
knows okay

170
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,879
i'm i'm sure that you know sulek and

171
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,120
other people and

172
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,680
understand it

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,240
but many people think that you know two

174
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,560
receptors cb1 cb2

175
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,680
two three

176
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,199
molecules anandamide to a g i'm teaching

177
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,038
in

178
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,038
in israel in order to be physicians that

179
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,560
prescribe cannabis you need to pass a

180
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,719
course also pharmacies or or nurses and

181
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,319
i'm teaching in these courses the most

182
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,400
of the lessons there

183
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,479
and but before after me there is the

184
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,399
head of the minister of health that's

185
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,719
responsible to cannabis

186
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,959
and i'm teaching three hours the

187
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,759
the pharmacies about the

188
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,478
endocannabinoids where they're

189
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,000
expressing the enzymes and breaking them

190
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:46,000
and then you know

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
90 some endocannabinoids in 160 feet of

192
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,439
cannabinoids the head of the minister of

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,918
health that's responsible to cannabis

194
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,478
come after me said daddy thank you very

195
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,758
much always amazing talk

196
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,918
there is a difference between what's

197
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
happened in the lab in reality in the

198
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,279
lab that he told you what happened in

199
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,038
reality there are two cannabinoids and

200
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,318
two receptors

201
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,519
he

202
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,199
don't don't spoil you know don't don't

203
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,240
spoil the physician think there is more

204
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,199
than two cannabinoids right

205
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,840
this is an extremely extremely

206
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,160
complicated system every cell in our

207
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,038
body harboring the endocannabinoid

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,720
system

209
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,918
my lab is working around 30 35 receptors

210
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,639
that are participating in the

211
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,799
endocannabinoid system we can analyze in

212
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,320
the blood samples around 90 some

213
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,759
endocannabinoids all together we think

214
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,839
there is around 130 140

215
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,158
there is something like 50 which we call

216
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,040
them endocannabinoids it's like

217
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,958
very complicated system that balancing

218
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,838
keeping homostasis

219
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,799
on our body okay actually it's a

220
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,279
communication between two cells one cell

221
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,639
set a signal to under cells create

222
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,838
appetite reduce pain affect sleep

223
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,399
reduce

224
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,880
increase insulin and so on and so on

225
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,039
it's just communication one part is the

226
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,000
ligand the endocannabinoid the other

227
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,399
part is protein called receptors capture

228
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,759
that send the signal

229
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,958
cannabis was just unlucky to produce

230
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,080
similar compounds and we create a poodle

231
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,599
right

232
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,519
because

233
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,759
we need it but in the end is just

234
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,560
producing similar compound then binding

235
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,919
these receptors and send signaling that

236
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,079
our body

237
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,599
know how to do

238
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,879
our problem

239
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,800
that we don't know enough about the

240
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,720
endocannabinoid system and the signaling

241
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,399
and more important we don't know which

242
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,800
molecules from the cannabis is mimicking

243
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,559
the process that we don't know what the

244
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,679
endocannabinoid is doing so

245
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,518
there is it's going in and disappearing

246
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,838
but in the last seven years i saw i

247
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,080
think more than 500

248
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,800
startup companies that claim that they

249
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,959
know which doing what it take me 30

250
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,519
seconds to break them apart like we

251
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,559
don't know mostly we're starting to

252
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,879
understand a little bit cbd cbg

253
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,958
not to the depth that we need and one of

254
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,879
the problem that cannabis is not one

255
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,399
plant in my lab only we have more than

256
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,039
one thousand

257
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,278
different camovers of cannabis i'm the

258
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,958
dream of every stoner

259
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,240
unfortunately

260
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,399
unfortunately i'm not a user

261
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,879
i'm trying to work now with soviet

262
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,519
mushroom maybe this will you know be

263
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,838
effective for me

264
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,240
so there is tons of camouflage each one

265
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,079
of them contain different combination of

266
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,120
molecules

267
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:46,719
and we don't know to match the right

268
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,799
flower to the right bright okay and

269
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
after 25

270
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,359
years of marriage i can talk about

271
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,120
matching and then flowers to the right

272
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,600
bride and what's happened to the right

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,879
bride after 24 years but

274
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,480
this is a different story we don't know

275
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,639
how to match

276
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,440
the flowers and this is

277
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,480
actually the problem to connect all

278
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,200
these dots

279
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,519
endocannabinoids receptors affecting the

280
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,278
the the

281
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,200
endocannabinoids the the cannabinoids

282
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,799
the camoufers we are far from

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,120
understanding them

284
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,759
so my talk today was how to match that

285
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,440
but i'm run out of time so i'm not sure

286
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,519
we read that so i want to show you how

287
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,079
me and my lab and my team trying to

288
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,078
approach this question in three

289
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,958
different ways

290
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:41,439
one way is when we have

291
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,439
a question on something that we have

292
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,560
zero knowledge okay

293
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,279
cancer

294
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,799
how to i will skip that so

295
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,000
this is

296
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,359
saying that

297
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,159
no

298
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,159
here no no no yes no questions okay

299
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,278
you born with english we are starting to

300
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,919
learn in

301
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:11,078
in grade four i think english and the

302
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,078
first lesson called yes no questions

303
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,278
so it's a joke in hebrew yes no

304
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,278
questions

305
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,319
that's so

306
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,519
where we start we started first of all

307
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,360
creating

308
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,600
tools to do this research and i will

309
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,839
skip it we create the tools to analyze

310
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,079
all the phytocannabinoids we can analyze

311
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,600
their 11 different families all together

312
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:35,838
around 160 fetal cannabinoids we can do

313
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,079
that also to the endocannabinoid system

314
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,440
taking your blood samples tissue or

315
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,759
biopsy we can analyze around the

316
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,079
as i said around 100 a little bit more

317
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,078
endocannabinoid we're participating in

318
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,719
almost 20 clinical trials when we're

319
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:54,000
getting blood samples tissue to start to

320
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,720
get a profile of this endocannabinoid

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,720
i'm working with stacy getting from here

322
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,800
we're trying to put our hands i won't

323
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,480
touch this at all

324
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,120
the point is

325
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,399
i want to show in the 17 minutes that i

326
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
have

327
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,240
three approaches how we

328
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,039
succeed how we're trying to match the

329
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,480
right flower the right combination

330
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,838
to the right

331
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,079
indication

332
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,360
so first thing if we don't any we don't

333
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,679
know anything

334
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,000
you know we don't know

335
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,439
we we don't have any information from

336
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
patients

337
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,839
how can this affecting real cancer okay

338
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,440
for an example so

339
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,320
we want to test how cannabis is

340
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,399
affecting leukemia breast cancer colon

341
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
cancer so how we do that we're doing

342
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,799
that we can grow cells in plate like

343
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,920
that we can grow cells this is cells in

344
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:49,198
the plate this is one cell you know the

345
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:51,679
dark side in inside is a nucleus if

346
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:54,319
somebody don't know how cells look in

347
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,000
the microscope so we grow with senso

348
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,079
cells in a plate

349
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,919
plate like that contain between three to

350
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,439
ten million cells depend on the types of

351
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,838
the cells we can grow cells also in in

352
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,560
plates that have many wells we have

353
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,639
equipment to run this fast

354
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:15,439
and screen these wells and get an input

355
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,519
i won't go into that just because this

356
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,279
frightened clock is going down very fast

357
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,560
literally every second it's three

358
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,799
seconds

359
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,799
here

360
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,560
so

361
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,560
we can screen it very fast so we ask how

362
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,719
it's affecting leukemia we know that

363
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,879
cannabis is affecting the immune system

364
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,560
we have a lot of data from crohn's

365
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,320
colitis disease

366
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,078
autoimmune disease we know that cannabis

367
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,720
affecting the immune system so we're

368
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,519
asking how cannabis affecting the cancer

369
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,000
of the immune system leukemia so early a

370
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,639
phd student in my lab started to work

371
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,198
with tl this is a specific type of

372
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,919
leukemia and it took

373
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:01,919
a tll cell that growing in the cell

374
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:04,559
screen about that around 200 different

375
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,120
cannabis strains so every calorie it's a

376
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,119
different strain and we see viability so

377
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,039
if the line is lower the meaning that

378
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,799
more cells are dying so you see that in

379
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,240
two micrograms per ml

380
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,240
most of the

381
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,320
cannabis strains didn't affect the cells

382
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,560
at all but there was one bastard that

383
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,480
killed these cells like hell

384
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,958
so we said okay

385
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,800
leukemia is a given name to many

386
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,000
different types

387
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,639
of

388
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,799
diseases there are tll and cll and bill

389
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,360
and i won't go into that let's see how

390
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:39,039
it's affecting in the long range so we

391
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,039
took this extract extract number 12 and

392
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,599
they joke in the lab that ellie screen

393
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:47,120
around 300 but extract 12 was the good

394
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,120
one so he can stop at 13.

395
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,879
so we screened that on on 10 different

396
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,519
leukemias and we saw that in 50 of the

397
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,838
leukemias the cannabis is not affecting

398
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,720
but in fifty percent of them it's still

399
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,040
like

400
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,680
very efficient we did a genetic

401
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,078
screening and we saw that every time

402
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,719
there is specific mutation called notch

403
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,638
one mutation the cannabis is killing the

404
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,120
cell every time that there is no

405
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,799
mutation different mutation it's not

406
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,839
affecting the cells

407
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,879
in tll 50 almost 60 percent of the

408
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,279
patient will harbor not one mutation

409
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,600
notch one is a protein sitting on the

410
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,639
membrane and in general if i'm

411
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,879
flattening that he's feeling that there

412
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,360
is another cell near him and there is

413
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,958
something called contact inhibition if

414
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,759
there is cells around you you won't

415
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,319
proliferate and create another cells but

416
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,159
cancer cells which become crazy one of

417
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,079
the things that happened they're losing

418
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,679
this contact inhibition proliferate and

419
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,319
create a tumor right

420
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,879
so notch one in the normal place his

421
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,600
standing feeling thinks this is three

422
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,000
dimension there is many proteins feeling

423
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,959
the cells around them and they are fine

424
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,519
if there is no cell it's vacant in time

425
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,399
there is other protein can cleave cleave

426
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,959
that

427
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,679
no one become transcription factor going

428
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,279
to the nucleus and push create other

429
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,400
proteins

430
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,480
to

431
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,038
proliferate and defend on the cells

432
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,038
never mind the biology about that but

433
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,038
also we send the new

434
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,798
note one back to the membrane because it

435
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:25,919
was cleaved you need to create a new one

436
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:28,879
so seeing that the extract number 12 is

437
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,200
very effective we went to a mice model

438
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,520
we created tumors you see a ct of the

439
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,440
mice with a tumor in his back right we

440
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,200
create this tumor we treat them with

441
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,480
extract number 12.

442
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,319
the black line in the on the left is a

443
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,679
the size of the tumors that they're

444
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:49,119
treating with a vehicle with a a kind of

445
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,640
placebo and not placebo with a control

446
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,439
you see the size is growing

447
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,360
exponentially the gray line is the size

448
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,519
of the tumor treated with extract number

449
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,719
12 it didn't affect them

450
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:03,279
in the middle is the start of the demise

451
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,759
the right size is the the size of the

452
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,480
tumor of the three-week treatment they

453
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:11,200
are shrinking because this is leukemia

454
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,759
we did the bone marrow implantation we

455
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,160
doubled the the lifespan of this

456
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,160
mice we did actually five different

457
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,558
models of a

458
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,440
a mice model to this

459
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:26,240
including primary cells directly from

460
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,798
the patient to the mice it's work very

461
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,480
efficiently okay

462
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,759
now

463
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:37,200
the 100 million dollar question

464
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,319
from all of these compounds from this

465
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,720
extract

466
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,399
do we need all of them the entourage

467
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,519
effect do we need one

468
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,759
three five my slogan to my students i

469
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,400
want to know the minimum compounds

470
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,640
they're doing maximum effect it's maybe

471
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,080
one it's maybe five okay

472
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,160
so how we're doing that we're taking

473
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,839
this extract and we cutting into pieces

474
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,480
we're doing fractions

475
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,399
okay we said okay there is 100 compounds

476
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,839
we had the equipment to separate them to

477
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,000
25 25 25 and 25 we're going back to the

478
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,240
cells or to the mice and you can see the

479
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,119
vehicle the control is not killing the

480
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,519
cells extract numbers number 12 is very

481
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,479
efficient and then the four fraction

482
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:21,440
and ali was more lucky than than smart

483
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,519
that extra that fraction number two

484
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,080
worked as good as the whole extract

485
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:30,960
already eliminating 75 percent

486
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:33,199
75 percent of the other cannabinoids

487
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,079
these are the the biochemistry behind it

488
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,960
not important we keep doing that

489
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,678
and in the end we succeed to isolate

490
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,319
three fetal cannabinoids that if you

491
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,519
isolate them make them synthetic or

492
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,240
whatever

493
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,960
100 purified you put them together you

494
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,519
get exactly the same effect as the whole

495
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,519
extract but every combination this is

496
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,480
this the left side

497
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,240
the low

498
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,400
a bar left side

499
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,440
if you every combination of one of them

500
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,919
or two of them are not working as good

501
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,519
as their and the three of them together

502
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,679
we did a lot of work a lot of

503
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,798
biochemistry to understand the mechanism

504
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,440
of action i don't have time to show that

505
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,759
but the bottom line we understand today

506
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,200
exactly why you need the three of them

507
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:24,960
actually we did what we called synergism

508
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,759
testing and two of them cbd and cbd cbdv

509
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,558
are additive you can replace one of them

510
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,839
by increase the other so we don't need

511
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:35,759
the both of them we can reduce it to two

512
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,319
molecules in the extract we need the

513
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,879
both of them because it's additive but

514
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,359
if i'm taking purified is enough too but

515
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,000
the other one a unique cannabinoid we

516
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,038
call them three three one eight

517
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,919
here's

518
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,359
a derivative of cbd very different

519
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,759
structure

520
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,759
and cbdn's and him

521
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,558
binding two different receptors who are

522
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,679
binding cb2 and trpv1

523
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,599
activating a proteins called ceramide in

524
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,240
the cell that creating er stress

525
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,839
elevating three different proteins 84

526
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,279
chop and chakra and chuck one is going

527
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,798
to the golgi and

528
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,480
blocking not one to go back mature to

529
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,158
the to the membrane

530
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,079
again i know don't know how many

531
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,760
physician or biologists are here in the

532
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:24,639
crowd so i'm trying not to go to deep

533
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,240
biology i'm just want to

534
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,960
transfer

535
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:34,079
the the the idea that we know exactly

536
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,960
why when there is a natural mutation

537
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,960
cannabis will kill the cells

538
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,079
it's not any more

539
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,600
rich in some oil we think maybe we know

540
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,798
exactly

541
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,199
why when there is no mutation it won't

542
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,279
affect the cells when there is mutation

543
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,720
why these cells committing suicide to

544
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,918
the bottom

545
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,880
of the mechanism of action

546
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,559
and from that point i can convince any

547
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,080
hematologist

548
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:07,599
to try to to use it on on his patient to

549
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,759
go to read clinical trial to prove it on

550
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,079
humans and that's what we're doing

551
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,480
most important you need to understand

552
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,158
that if now we're saying yes cannabis

553
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,400
can kill cancer

554
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,120
and just show you that from 300

555
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,679
different extracts just one of them was

556
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,079
effective on from this this one is

557
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,440
affecting just of 50 percent of the of

558
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,480
the patient

559
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,759
so what is the

560
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,240
stat of success of a patient that going

561
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:39,839
to a dispensary and pick the right

562
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,319
cannabis to to kill the right cancer

563
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,158
it's a lottery

564
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,639
and it's not that i don't believe that

565
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,400
cannabis can be effective to cancer

566
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,799
but i don't believe that it's killing

567
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,240
every type of cancer in every type of

568
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:57,038
cannabis i think there is a lot of work

569
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,000
to match the right flower to the right

570
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,960
disease

571
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,640
so we open a company and we raise money

572
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,960
and we are going clinical trials with

573
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,679
that and there is two pathway one

574
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,319
pathway to take extract number 12 and

575
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,480
treat the patient and actually in israel

576
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,240
if you're oncology patient you

577
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,200
immediately get prescriptions for

578
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,000
cannabis in order to reduce pain nausea

579
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,000
increase appetite so actually

580
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,599
the patient today if you're oncology

581
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,558
patient you get a prescription you can

582
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,480
go and take extract number 12.

583
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:32,079
it's on the shelf

584
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,519
so i don't need to start safety i can go

585
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:38,399
directly to the patient work with them

586
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,558
the oncologist to just match it

587
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,278
so quite fast in a year year and a half

588
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,918
i can be after poc proof of concept that

589
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,599
this extract working on this patient

590
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,679
checking notch one and everything the

591
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,798
other direction is further former

592
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:56,240
direction if somebody want to donate to

593
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,319
me 200 million dollars i will do that

594
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,480
also

595
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,038
we're doing that but i'm looking for the

596
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,038
donation

597
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,080
so this was

598
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,038
when we know nothing we're starting

599
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,639
what

600
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:15,038
cannabis will fit to alzheimer to

601
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,799
leukemia we don't have knowledge

602
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,200
but there is another way

603
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,440
if i have previous knowledge

604
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,519
in

605
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,400
2015 i got five million dollars to do

606
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,798
the israeli database on patient having

607
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,559
the ability to know all the compounds i

608
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,480
applied and said i'm the only one in the

609
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,798
world that actually knows

610
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,079
what the patient is getting not just you

611
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:40,798
know white widow and black forest i can

612
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,199
look on the molecules

613
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,679
so we got five million dollars to create

614
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,400
the database on all the products that

615
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,440
patients can get there was just eight

616
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,640
authorized growers around 80 to 90

617
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,720
products

618
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,799
and we we had agreement that every time

619
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,400
that they're picking a batch or creating

620
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,119
a a new

621
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,600
a product it will come to our lab to

622
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,558
analyze it on the other hand we follow

623
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,240
up on the patient and create a database

624
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,639
a shitty one

625
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,839
unfortunately

626
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,159
almost worth nothing and i can give a

627
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:19,199
good talk about two hours how to spend

628
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,200
five million dollars

629
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,519
but

630
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,960
it's gave me

631
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,519
a tool

632
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,919
to start to understand where really

633
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,480
cannabis is affecting what are the

634
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,759
strains that are better so now i don't

635
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,640
need to start to screen 300 strains if i

636
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,798
want to work on sleep disorder i can

637
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,880
choose i will skip that i can choose one

638
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:43,679
strain that i know that is the best for

639
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,159
the

640
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,720
for the patient and start from there and

641
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,400
again around after time i will say we we

642
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,679
we create

643
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,278
a a screening on the mice it's very

644
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,519
funny and sorry for the people that

645
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:00,079
heard that yesterday

646
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,960
we we are following on three different

647
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:06,720
parts of of sleep disorder

648
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,038
when a mice is sleeping when is this a

649
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,038
a light and is awake when it's dark so

650
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:14,079
when you're turning on the light the

651
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,720
mice with a range is bad it will take a

652
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,879
around 15 minutes to arrange this bed

653
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,038
it's very funny thing because there is a

654
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,120
big difference between male and female

655
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,278
the female will arrange a bed around 15

656
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,558
minutes the the male will arrange his

657
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,558
bed around seven minutes

658
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,360
literally after i heard that i want to

659
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,440
do an experiment i want to see how much

660
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:39,119
times take the male to arrange this base

661
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,640
bed when the female is around

662
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:45,678
between 10 to 11 minutes okay

663
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,320
he's not doing the full exercise but is

664
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,240
better okay so we separate them and we

665
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,359
follow up how much times take them to

666
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,120
arrange his bed how much time

667
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,759
um

668
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,678
he's sleeping the duration and also a

669
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,679
mice is lifting his head around every

670
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,798
two minutes to look around there is no

671
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,480
mice

672
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,319
and no cat around

673
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,200
so we are measuring these three

674
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:12,240
parameters one is giving you idea

675
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,400
how fast or how tired he is second how

676
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,880
deep his sleep is and the third one is

677
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,120
the duration of sleep so we taking we're

678
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,679
choosing we're choosing these are the

679
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,278
strength that we chose and we started

680
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,120
with the strength that worked the best

681
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,119
to the patient so we already know that

682
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,439
it's work this strain is working on

683
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,398
humans now we're going backward to the

684
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,480
mice to check what is doing this effect

685
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,798
so this is a strain that was very

686
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,079
effective the purple one is the control

687
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,639
green a

688
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,119
red and blue are different batches of

689
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,679
this trend that was very

690
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,839
efficient by creating the mice to be

691
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,480
very tired and go to sleep

692
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,359
fast also increase the duration of the

693
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,759
sleep

694
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,798
and and again the question these are all

695
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,398
the molecules in this strain which one

696
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,480
which of the molecule is doing this

697
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,038
effect and the same methodology from

698
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,360
here we're doing a fractionation cutting

699
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,519
these two pieces and i will skip that

700
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,959
because i have just another two minutes

701
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,079
and i want to show

702
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,038
more

703
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,558
things we started to fraction we cut out

704
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:21,599
the thc it's work the same we said okay

705
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:24,480
there is also quite a lot of cbn in cbg

706
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,240
we cut the cbn out it still worked the

707
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,558
same

708
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,640
we said okay let's cut now the cbg and

709
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,918
the other we left with just two

710
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,880
molecules

711
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,360
both of them unknown molecules and these

712
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,520
two molecules working as good as the

713
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,479
whole extract and this is when we are

714
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,798
now we know exactly which molecules are

715
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,919
there there are two unknown

716
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:50,480
molecules derivative t and cbn but never

717
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,038
mind the details we call them d we're

718
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,839
calling them gts go to sleep one and go

719
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,839
to sleep two

720
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,319
maybe we'll change the name i'm not sure

721
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,639
but

722
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,339
this is where we are and from here

723
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,759
again we have two

724
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:07,839
[Music]

725
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,879
paths to go one of them

726
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:14,000
is to tank the extract to cut it in here

727
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,799
to take out the thc take out the cbn

728
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
left with the part of the extract

729
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:22,720
zero t8c 0cbn but still effective

730
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,480
of sleep and i can tell you that the big

731
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,558
population of people

732
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,960
that have problem to sleep don't want to

733
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:32,079
take cannabis because of the thc

734
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,919
my mother my father a lot of people and

735
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:38,480
this is a new product 0 t 0 cbd steel

736
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:42,240
extract with a lot of cannabinoids but

737
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,159
very efficient to put you asleep second

738
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,200
again is a pharma way take these

739
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:50,000
cannabinoids go form a direction and so

740
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,319
on so this was second method first

741
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,440
method if you don't know anything second

742
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,200
method if you have an idea on something

743
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,679
you can start with a strain that you

744
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,159
know that is affecting from human try to

745
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,200
isolate and define why it's effective

746
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,919
and the third one is more bioinformatics

747
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,640
too

748
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,759
so again from the database we we

749
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,240
collected

750
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,960
we saw that there is no indication in

751
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,000
israel for migraine but we saw that many

752
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,558
patients whether they are ptsd patient

753
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,398
cancer patient also say that they are

754
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:25,359
suffering from migraine and cannabis

755
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:28,319
help them so we looked on just on this

756
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,558
patient around 500 and we sent this

757
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,119
patient questionnaire for migraine and

758
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,839
we know that the endocannabinoid system

759
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,678
is important in in the world of creating

760
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,839
and preventing migraines so it makes

761
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,919
sense the cannabis will be effective of

762
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,158
that so we collect data from this

763
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,360
patient on the migraine and we try to

764
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,399
divide with strain and not helping or

765
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,479
create a migraine to be more severe in

766
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,558
which strains are helping on the

767
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,759
stranded helping because we know all the

768
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,558
molecules we try to look which molecules

769
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,679
are

770
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:04,879
appearing in all the strains that are

771
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,679
there we find five molecules that are

772
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,200
unique molecules and not the major one

773
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,679
that are appearing in most of the

774
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,240
strains that reduce migraine we looked

775
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,679
on them we gave them there we started to

776
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,519
to look what they are we analyzing them

777
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,080
we separate them we understand the

778
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,839
structure of each one of them and now

779
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:27,359
after we understand the structure we're

780
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:30,558
doing modeling about which one of them

781
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,798
probably will bind the receptors that

782
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,398
affect the migraine i won't go there

783
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,639
into that

784
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,079
oh it's nice now the time is going up so

785
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,799
i have

786
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,798
lots of time

787
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,039
so i'm done in

788
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,240
15 minutes

789
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,839
two minutes

790
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
so

791
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,199
we

792
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,159
we know the mechanism we know it's not

793
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,399
the mechanism of migraine in part is

794
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,600
known we know which receptors in the

795
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,918
brain are responsible to to migraine

796
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:07,199
there are treatments for that so we did

797
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,919
now modeling about these five molecules

798
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,640
that we have which one we think

799
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,519
will bind these receptors and which one

800
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,278
will fit to the receptors after we find

801
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,278
out which one of them

802
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:23,359
we isolated that and and test it now in

803
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,359
cell model and mice model that it's

804
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,519
really binding first of all that it's

805
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,359
really binding the receptors and after

806
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,919
we find these binding the receptors it's

807
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,199
really affecting the activity of the

808
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,640
receptors and and and reducing migraines

809
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,240
so we started with totally

810
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,399
bioinformatics

811
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,960
from the knowledge that went until we

812
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:45,599
find the molecules and now we prove that

813
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,399
it's really working after we find it we

814
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:51,759
can modulate these molecules

815
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:54,398
doing chemically changes and know this

816
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,640
crowd don't like it but we taking

817
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:59,678
synthetically modified it that it will

818
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,880
actually work better but more of that

819
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,759
trying to see if other cannabinoids can

820
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,760
work together again bioinformatically

821
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:11,200
and we improving the affinity and

822
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,000
activity of these molecules 100 times

823
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,480
more

824
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,599
active than the one we really found in

825
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,120
the beginning in in the in the plant so

826
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,439
summarizing

827
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,719
what i showed

828
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,519
i think that

829
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,079
cannabis is harboring what we called

830
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,079
polypharmacology okay

831
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:33,199
and again yesterday i had time to

832
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,480
explain that i won't go deeper to that i

833
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,679
think for

834
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,640
people use

835
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,440
plants for thousands of years as as a

836
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,600
medicine but in the last 100 years

837
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,480
we know which plants affected what and

838
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:49,199
in pharma company isolate molecules and

839
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,679
we call it single molecule single target

840
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,919
create a medicine from that and and more

841
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,000
than 50 percent of the medicine where

842
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,038
these are chemotherapy like taxol

843
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,240
vincrestine where there are our a

844
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:04,480
medicine to reduce fever like aspirin

845
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,359
coming from plants but it's single

846
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,119
molecule single comp single compound

847
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,519
single target

848
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,800
in the last 20 years we're starting to

849
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,519
see that

850
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,639
there are diseases that we need in order

851
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:21,039
to affect them to attack them and to

852
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,878
modulate them in more than one target

853
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:26,159
more than one area okay one demo one

854
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,159
direction

855
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,280
and we call it poly pharmacology we

856
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,679
still in farm in in medicine

857
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,919
doing that on medicine that each one of

858
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,760
them was authorized as a medicine and

859
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,279
we're combining them

860
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,280
cancer is a classic example when we give

861
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,320
more than one chemotherapy we're giving

862
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,119
kind of a cocktail c plus t plus b or

863
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,919
plus biologic okay one is attacking the

864
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,720
dna one is blocking the cytoskeleton one

865
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:57,118
is blocking the receptors and we're

866
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,439
treating the patient like that

867
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,200
if we think about

868
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,880
plants they're harboring inside of them

869
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:09,199
poly pharmacology the physician 3000

870
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,440
4000 years ago looks like that and if

871
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,759
you come with inflammation he wouldn't

872
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,480
give you one molecule he will pick one

873
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,359
flower from here one word from here

874
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,599
one lift from here combine them together

875
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:24,159
and we'd give you something that he

876
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,280
created as a polypharmacology

877
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,480
maybe eighty percent of this is is

878
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,920
placebo

879
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,079
but also it's laying about a lot of data

880
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,559
that's been acquired

881
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,400
by these treatments

882
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:44,159
and i believe that the next step of

883
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,599
complicated medicines that will overcome

884
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:50,239
diseases that we can treat like als

885
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,400
alzheimer's types of cancer and so on

886
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,719
and so on will come

887
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,838
from complicated treatment

888
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,838
and

889
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,920
plants are harboring that inside we

890
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,320
already have this knowledge now we need

891
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,680
to understand why it's working for for

892
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,000
that okay

893
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,159
so the change that happened in the last

894
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,320
20 years is computers

895
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,879
understanding different routes

896
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,079
understanding networks

897
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,559
today

898
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,440
can be done in computers very efficient

899
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,480
that

900
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,079
20 years ago it will almost impossible

901
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,639
and i think this is

902
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,039
the next step what i think cannabis did

903
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,759
cannabis is actually an orchestra of

904
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,880
molecules that acting on different

905
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,599
receptors in very complicated way

906
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,160
and i think if people think that

907
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,200
a rafi reshoolam need to get in a nobel

908
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,399
prize because they found the

909
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,239
cannabinoids

910
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,119
i think he needed to get a nobel prize

911
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:47,679
because he opened the gate for all of us

912
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:52,000
to understand the complexity

913
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:54,719
of plant biology of polypharmacology

914
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,320
cannabis give us the tools open the mind

915
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,719
of physician

916
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,920
to treat with complex to treats with

917
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:05,679
plants and gave us the tools

918
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,039
laboratories like mind to start to do it

919
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,679
even more

920
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,279
on in on other plants not that i think

921
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,279
that i have

922
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,760
enough from cannabis i think

923
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,240
way after my retirement there was a lot

924
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,040
of work to do just with cannabis but i

925
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,479
think

926
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:26,159
the message is way way way bigger than

927
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,159
just a the cannabis plant this is

928
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,199
so what i think

929
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,159
actually

930
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:34,879
what i have today in my lab and my team

931
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:37,598
it's not the lab that doing research on

932
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,119
cannabis it's actually

933
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,800
kind of

934
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,280
method methodology how to work with this

935
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,000
complex plant how to do extract how to

936
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,599
analyze active compound how to run them

937
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,159
on different diseases define the

938
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,400
specific effect mechanism of action

939
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:57,440
pre-clinical clinical how to take

940
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,200
something from is initial complex when

941
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,000
we think we know that is actually

942
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:04,799
working on humans and taking all the

943
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,880
route up to clinical trials so this is

944
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,039
the amazing team that work under my

945
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,039
supervision they're doing the work when

946
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:14,079
i'm traveling in the world

947
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,429
and i'm grateful for them and thank you

948
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,740
for you for listening

949
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:20,699
[Music]

950
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:20,699
[Applause]

951
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,880
you
