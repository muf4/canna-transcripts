1
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:09,199
thanks so much to the organizers of kin

2
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:10,459
med and cordage inand Doug Kennedy

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,919
forgetting everything so beautifully

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,929
organized so I have made two promises

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,219
one I will speak very quickly and stay

6
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:19,160
within our a lot of time because we are

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,990
running over and two I will make sure

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,640
that you have an excellent experience so

9
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:24,019
I don't have to tell this audience after

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,160
several days of this fantastic

11
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,500
conference that marijuana has been

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,329
around seemingly forever if you look at

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,859
newly discovered photographic evidence

14
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,199
you will see very closely that it

15
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,659
actually wasn't a fig leaf covering Adam

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,880
and Eve's most private parts that's

17
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:39,439
right that's right we have it we are

18
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,270
Harvard Medical School we know how to do

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,530
it if you look very closely at the

20
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,940
inside of the pyramids and of course

21
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,950
evidence from the Sistine Chapel you

22
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:47,750
will see that images related to cannabis

23
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,760
have been around for thousands of years

24
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,009
I'm only kidding of course but this is

25
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,839
just a way to transition into the idea

26
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,519
that in fact cannabis has been around

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,390
for thousands of years first documented

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,880
as medicine in 2700 BC was part of

29
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,009
mainstream medicine in the u.s. part of

30
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,570
the u.s. pharmacopoeia in 1850 which

31
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,728
meant that doctors could and did

32
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:10,309
prescribe cannabis for a range of

33
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:12,618
indications by 1942 it was out of the

34
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,329
pharmacopoeia and by 1970 it was

35
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:16,368
classified as a schedule 1 substance

36
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:19,608
under the then new controlled substance

37
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:21,289
act 1996 saw the first medical marijuana

38
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:24,078
laws in California and since that time

39
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:26,329
watch my beautifully animated slide we

40
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:28,428
have seen lots of changes across the

41
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:31,068
nation bringing us current to 2017 we

42
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:33,920
now have 28 states plus DC with fully

43
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:36,709
legalized medical marijuana laws another

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
17 with partial medical marijuana laws

45
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:40,609
allowing the use of things that are non

46
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,129
intoxicating like cannabidiol eight

47
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,688
states plus DC have allowed recreational

48
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:46,548
cannabis leaving only five states

49
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:49,278
without access that's the majority of

50
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,609
states very very important to keep in

51
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:54,078
mind not all marijuana is the same we

52
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:56,059
have this one term it really should be

53
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,129
termed cannabis but we call it marijuana

54
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,959
which means anything that comes from the

55
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:01,608
plant we won't go through the difference

56
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,439
in species since most of us already

57
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:06,108
agree at this point everything we see is

58
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,938
predominantly a hybrid of species more

59
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:10,038
importantly there are over 400 known

60
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:12,379
constituents in this magical plant a

61
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,780
hundred or more phyto cannabinoids these

62
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,560
are things that interact with our

63
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,909
endocannabinoid system and thankfully

64
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,620
for all my predecessors at this

65
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,090
conference I don't have

66
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,799
go through it but these are things that

67
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,658
interact with our brain and body system

68
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,519
of chemicals and receptors the two main

69
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:25,989
players no secret here Delta nine

70
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,459
tetrahydrocannabinol the main

71
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:30,480
psychoactive constituents in the plant

72
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,500
and cannabidiol the non-intoxicating

73
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,780
constituents shown to have tremendous

74
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,799
therapeutic potential the last thing

75
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,598
I'll say before we get into some

76
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:39,430
exciting data is that medical and

77
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,560
recreational marijuana should not be

78
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,959
considered the same I can't say that

79
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,239
enough they should not be considered the

80
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,950
same even though the products made me

81
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,349
identical the plants from which they're

82
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:52,298
derived are identical in fact the modes

83
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:53,738
of use may be identical the goal of use

84
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,170
is very different for our recreational

85
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,579
users than for our medical patients the

86
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:59,429
goal of recreational users I've been

87
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:01,959
doing recreational research sorry

88
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,209
recreational is research on recreational

89
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,219
cannabis users for 20-plus years their

90
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,780
goal is to feel altered high euphoric

91
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,239
our medical patients say I don't want to

92
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,199
be high most of them anyway I just want

93
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,269
to feel better

94
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,158
constituent profile is also very

95
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:18,489
different typically recreational strains

96
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:20,348
are prized for their THC potency we were

97
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,150
looking for high THC here in fact levels

98
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:23,738
of cannabidiol have all but disappeared

99
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,969
from recreational strains are dropping

100
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:29,769
about 46% since 1995 our medical

101
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,079
patients may have products that are high

102
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,849
in THC and or other CBD but there are

103
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,709
other constituents that factor into the

104
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:37,840
equation prominently age of onset

105
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,909
another very critical piece of the

106
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,159
puzzle typically our recreational users

107
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:44,530
begin using during adolescence or early

108
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,359
adulthood our medical marijuana patients

109
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,699
not exclusively but by and large begin

110
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,680
after age 25 that excludes of course our

111
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,510
pediatric samples I won't go through

112
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,280
what the national academy of science

113
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:55,358
engineering and medicine reported since

114
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,299
that's the three hundred ninety five

115
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,769
page paper back in January but many took

116
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,269
heart in the following there is

117
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,889
conclusive or substantial evidence that

118
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,930
cannabis or cannabinoids are effective

119
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,760
for what we call the big three treatment

120
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,560
of chronic pain treatment of nausea and

121
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,019
vomiting as a function of chemotherapy

122
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,780
and treatment of muscle related muscle

123
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:16,209
spasticity related to MS more recently

124
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,399
since the report was issued the senior

125
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,048
author of the paper Marie McCormack has

126
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,179
noted that in fact it seems to be useful

127
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:23,978
in reducing some forms of very severe

128
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,209
child seizure disorders too many of you

129
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:27,939
in the audience I know that is not a

130
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:29,259
surprise but to many out there it is and

131
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,149
it's good that we have it out there in

132
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,519
addition there's moderate or limited

133
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,629
evidence for a range of other conditions

134
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,949
suggesting that additional research is

135
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:38,350
needed I would say demanding that

136
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,459
additional research is needed so while

137
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,080
there have been a number of Medical

138
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,849
Marijuana studies to date research

139
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,529
really does remain in its infancy for

140
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,670
all the reasons you've heard here most

141
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:47,169
of them have to do with our current

142
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,300
status and some of the guidelines and

143
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,100
restrictions most studies have looked at

144
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,020
outcomes secondary to medical marijuana

145
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,620
use for a specific symptom illness or

146
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:57,729
indication limited sample sizes in

147
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,829
addition when we began this work we

148
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,470
could not find any studies that looked

149
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:04,029
at specifically the effects of the use

150
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,910
of cannabis for medical purposes on

151
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:08,019
cognitive performance was there a

152
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,880
difference in individuals who are using

153
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:11,799
medical marijuana in terms of their

154
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,589
ability to solve problems and do tasks

155
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,290
further no studies thus far had employed

156
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:19,329
a pre versus post treatment approach

157
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,830
enter the mind program marijuana

158
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,209
investigations for neuro scientific

159
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:23,800
discoveries of program I started at

160
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:26,519
McLean Hospital two and a half years ago

161
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,660
why it was designed to basically

162
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,909
understand the effects of medical

163
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,010
marijuana use on a range of things

164
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,990
including cognitive performance clinical

165
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,209
state quality of life where applicable

166
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,920
brain structure brain function and a

167
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:41,139
range of other measures we just don't

168
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,759
have this data available the program

169
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,129
supports a number of projects designed

170
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,170
to examine cannabinoid based therapies

171
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,909
for a range of indications and

172
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,069
conditions and we use longitudinal

173
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,410
observational cross-sectional survey and

174
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:57,009
clinical trial models but not all at the

175
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,240
same time that'd be a neat trick so I'm

176
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:00,279
gonna show you some data from an ongoing

177
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,540
longitudinal observational study that's

178
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,099
very exciting this study was

179
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,260
specifically designed really truly

180
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,210
really truly to look at the effect of

181
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:09,250
medical marijuana treatment on cognitive

182
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:11,079
performance as well as mood sleep

183
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,689
quality of life brain structure and

184
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,669
function in patients before they begin

185
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,110
using that's really important

186
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,939
this study is designed to follow

187
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,590
patients over a minimum of one year

188
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:22,439
we've now gotten permission to follow

189
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,579
them out for 18 months and 24 months

190
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,980
patients can use for any number of

191
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:29,019
indications and their choice of products

192
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,879
which we chart what they're using where

193
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,379
they got it what they're told is in it

194
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,389
so we have the information from the

195
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:36,279
dispensary we record it throughout the

196
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,139
course of the study how often it cetera

197
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,759
mode of use then we have their most

198
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,800
commonly used samples analyzed by an

199
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,719
outside laboratory our laboratory

200
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,610
representatives right here speaking in

201
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,870
this very session

202
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,490
the potential participants are referred

203
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,139
from local Medical Marijuana free

204
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,879
Marijuana certification centers or

205
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,259
physicians to some of whom are also here

206
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,000
we're eternally grateful for all of you

207
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,579
sending us patients the inclusion

208
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,170
exclusion criteria are simple patients

209
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:01,779
must have a valid certification for

210
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,040
medical marijuana use or plans to use

211
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:05,349
products that don't require a

212
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,870
certification for example industrial

213
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,030
hemp derived products certification can

214
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,459
be for any indication but they must be

215
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,199
marijuana naive at the outset of the

216
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:15,459
study this is important and if they have

217
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,889
any history of recreational marijuana

218
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:20,319
use it must be several years in the past

219
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,360
until very recently the average number

220
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,189
of years since heavy recreational use

221
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,990
was in excess of seven or eight now

222
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:28,509
we're down to about three so they have

223
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,829
to be THC negative at baseline we wrote

224
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,269
our first paper from this study at the

225
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:32,409
end of last year called splendor in the

226
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:35,229
grass it's been viewed just under

227
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,520
thirty-five thousand times to date and I

228
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,840
guess this issue was nominated for the

229
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,490
frontier spotlight award I only

230
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,049
mentioned this because it underscores

231
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,060
what the nation is interested in

232
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,800
learning which is about the effect of

233
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,139
the use of cannabis we need more

234
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,560
research so I have some updated data to

235
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,209
show you

236
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,220
we now have 38 patients who have

237
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:52,959
completed their baseline visit and 19

238
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,480
thus far who have completed their visit

239
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,909
to so they're naive at baseline then we

240
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,770
see them after three months of treatment

241
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,750
average age is about 50 predominantly

242
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:05,199
right-handed the indications range pain

243
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,759
anxiety PTSD sleep mood attention and

244
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,659
other what's other ulcerative colitis

245
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,430
chronic migraines petit mal seizures how

246
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,870
are they using they're using less than

247
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,220
everyday and we've heard some of that

248
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,230
earlier in this conference as well they

249
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,300
don't need to use every day they use

250
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,640
just a little less than twice a day they

251
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,160
use about nine times a week and they're

252
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,229
using about 1.6 grams what do they use

253
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,610
they smoke conventional flower product

254
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,960
they vaporize conventional flower

255
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,120
product they vaporize oils and

256
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,559
concentrates and you can see that there

257
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,080
there's other use of oils and

258
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,228
concentrates tinctures medical edibles

259
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,320
and topicals a lovely array of modes of

260
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:44,229
use here's an example of our product

261
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,050
analysis so we get constituent analysis

262
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:49,089
for ten of the cannabinoids which helps

263
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:51,159
us but what about the data I do not have

264
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,110
a pointer but I will guide your eye to

265
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:55,000
the important part of the slide if you

266
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,220
look the very first thing that jumps out

267
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,948
I see the point

268
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,410
is a significant reduction in depressive

269
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:02,789
symptoms so this is self-report this is

270
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:04,438
not examiner driven this isn't the study

271
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:07,110
doctor deciding that they look better

272
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:09,688
this is self-report significant

273
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,430
reduction in depressive symptoms between

274
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:13,500
baseline and after three months of

275
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:15,899
treatment we also see significant

276
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,120
improvements in self-reported sleep as

277
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,698
noted by the Pittsburgh sleep quality

278
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,339
index way up at the no that's wrong way

279
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:25,229
up at the top a significant improvement

280
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,060
in sleep we also see improvements on a

281
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,170
generalized health survey called the

282
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:29,278
sf-36

283
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:32,120
significant improvements in physical

284
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,019
role significant improvements in energy

285
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,669
significant improvements in social

286
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,799
functioning and significant improvements

287
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:39,659
in self-reported levels of pain let me

288
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,419
say really quickly we have a completely

289
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:44,519
separate subset of pain related scales

290
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,019
too much for me to show in this

291
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,970
particular presentation but this

292
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,310
patients all reports significant

293
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,139
improvement self-reported improvement in

294
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,088
pain related measures after three months

295
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,860
of treatment very importantly we also

296
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,189
see a notable decrease in their use of

297
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,199
conventional medications a 42 percent

298
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:04,230
reduction in opiate use that's again

299
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:05,938
self-report 46 percent reduction in

300
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,009
benzos 33 percent reduction in mood

301
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,169
stabilizers and a 22 percent reduction

302
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,419
in antidepressants I think this is quite

303
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,128
striking again very small sample sizes

304
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,259
but certainly enough of a signal for us

305
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:17,759
to be very excited so I won't belabor

306
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:19,318
the point too much other than to say we

307
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,000
were very interested in their cognitive

308
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,289
performance I spend a lot of time

309
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,789
thinking about frontal executive

310
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,049
functions the types of tasks that are

311
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,698
mediated by the frontal part of your

312
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:28,198
brain right behind your eyebrows things

313
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:31,370
that allow you to inhibit inappropriate

314
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:33,990
responses make good sound decisions and

315
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,970
detect conflict where appropriate so we

316
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,438
have lots of different measures of these

317
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,509
things including the controlled oral

318
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:40,860
word-association tasks basically the FAS

319
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,240
tasks I'm going to give you a letter of

320
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,009
the alphabet name as many words as you

321
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,990
can that begin with that letter digit

322
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:48,240
symbol substitution test patients are

323
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,730
basically asked to write as many symbols

324
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,528
as they can using a number symbol key as

325
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,839
many as they can do in 90 seconds letter

326
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:56,698
number sequencing subjects get a string

327
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,050
of mixed numbers and letters and they're

328
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,448
told they have to repeat them first the

329
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:02,068
numbers in order then the letters the

330
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:03,750
Stroop color word test the interference

331
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:05,370
condition everybody loves this one the

332
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,899
interference condition basically has

333
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,278
words printed in a different color ink

334
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,100
than they spell your brain wants you to

335
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:10,659
read it that's the most

336
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,700
automatic process you have I want you to

337
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:13,240
name the color of the ink harder than it

338
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,250
sounds

339
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,840
we also the trail making test Parts A

340
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,490
and B Part A is simply a test of

341
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,240
psychomotor speed how quickly can you

342
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,399
connect the dots

343
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,080
Part B introduces an alternating set

344
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,600
demand they have to alternate number

345
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,040
letter number letter 1a to be again

346
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,170
harder than it sounds see some people

347
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,719
saying oh oh that looks horrible doesn't

348
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:32,259
even make a nice picture let's start

349
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,930
with that

350
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:36,460
finally the Wisconsin card sorting task

351
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:38,079
one of my favorites considered for

352
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,910
decades to be the gold standard measure

353
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,230
of frontal executive function very

354
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:43,059
simple subjects are given a deck of

355
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,590
cards and for stimulus cards they are

356
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:46,299
asked to take one card at a time and

357
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,769
place it in front of one of the four

358
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:49,929
stimulus cards what they don't know

359
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:51,340
after being told correct or incorrect is

360
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:52,839
that the sorting principle has changed

361
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,460
and they have to utilize the feedback

362
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,470
from the examiner to change their

363
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,680
behavior that's the frontal function so

364
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,540
how do they do well again significant

365
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,269
improvement from baseline to three

366
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:06,610
months one day I'll get this right if

367
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:08,529
you look up here we see significant

368
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,850
improvements in the FAS tasks

369
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,169
significant improvements in letter

370
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,399
number sequencing significant

371
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:14,709
improvements in digit symbol

372
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,559
substitution the Stroop color word test

373
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,610
significantly higher accuracy and

374
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,099
significantly fewer errors of omission

375
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,930
we see a trend for faster response time

376
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,340
during trails let me stop and say one

377
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:26,739
quick thing as if this wasn't quick

378
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,629
enough we have alternate forms of all of

379
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,370
these tests so we don't see any practice

380
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:31,659
effect here okay they have alternate

381
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,129
forms of these measures at three months

382
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:36,429
this isn't a practice effect plus it's

383
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:37,689
been three months neuroimaging I run

384
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:39,069
something called the cognitive and

385
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,750
clinical neuroimaging core where I am

386
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,170
fortunate enough to work around lots of

387
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,970
lovely magnets retrofitted in such a way

388
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:48,009
that we can do structural functioning

389
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,050
like structural functional spectroscopic

390
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:52,419
and diffusion tensor imaging all with

391
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:54,009
what we call one-stop shopping so we can

392
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:55,719
take lots of different pieces of

393
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,519
information and put them together later

394
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,830
I'm going to show you some data from an

395
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,569
fMRI study that we did in all of the

396
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,180
patients who are able to complete visit

397
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,560
one and two so once again we have them

398
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:07,359
completed tasks while they're inside the

399
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,849
scanner this is called the multi source

400
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,830
interference task two conditions here in

401
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,230
the control task subjects basically get

402
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,850
three numbers two or zero and one is a

403
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,980
different number they have to report the

404
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,440
identity of the number with a button box

405
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,670
in the control task it's easy the number

406
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,750
that's different is in its correct

407
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:25,360
position as on the button

408
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,309
box simple now we have the interference

409
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,289
condition this time the two numbers that

410
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:31,419
are the same are not zeros and the

411
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:33,279
number to be relieved of one of these

412
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,360
things is not like the other right so

413
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,980
which one of these things is not like

414
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,899
the other except now it's not in its

415
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,399
correct position as on the button box so

416
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,289
they have to inhibit the overwhelming

417
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,720
tendency of the visual position and

418
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:45,759
instead report the identity how do they

419
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,310
do let's just go to the interference

420
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,019
task right here in the middle

421
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,579
significant improvements in percent

422
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,309
accuracy they go from eighty one point

423
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,030
eight to eighty seven point eight

424
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:57,549
significantly fewer errors of omission

425
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:58,750
significantly faster response time I

426
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:00,099
won't bore you with the derived

427
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,350
interference at the bottom but suffice

428
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,360
it to say it's quite impressive after

429
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,000
three months again no practice effect

430
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,740
expected what about their brain imaging

431
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,129
what do they look like so at baseline

432
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,899
this is at baseline so no marijuana on

433
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:15,100
board we should see some activation by

434
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:16,120
the way typically we see activation

435
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,950
right here in the cingulate cortex

436
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,480
during the completion of this task and

437
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,340
we see a little more activation

438
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,460
typically in the frontal cortex what

439
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:27,519
happens after three months of treatment

440
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,780
so we see a very striking difference you

441
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,029
don't have to be a neuroscientist to see

442
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,919
that these images are different right so

443
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,509
a very different pattern of activation

444
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,879
here in the cingulate and in the frontal

445
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:38,620
cortex significantly more quote voxels

446
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,838
activated if any one he wants a physics

447
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,820
primer afterwards come and see me but

448
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,089
just to summarize what this data shows

449
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,530
us we see generally demonstrated

450
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,630
improvements in a number of these

451
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:51,279
measures of executive function this is

452
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:53,470
important because a lot of our work and

453
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,199
previous work and work of my colleagues

454
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,639
has demonstrated alterations and

455
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,520
executive function in recreational users

456
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,929
demonstrating sort of impairment

457
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,490
participants also exhibited notable

458
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:05,829
increases in activation in the frontal

459
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,539
cortex including the cingulate which is

460
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,580
a region typically activated by healthy

461
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,169
controls this is our folk our group at

462
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,420
baseline this is our group after three

463
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:15,849
months this is a study I did in 2012 of

464
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:17,469
healthy controls okay this is our group

465
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,990
after three months of treatment this is

466
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,940
a study of healthy controls okay so

467
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,440
three months of treatment that's what we

468
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,050
say overall findings suggest that

469
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,400
participants are able to quantify and

470
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:29,289
report their medical marijuana use

471
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,909
throughout the study we see improvements

472
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,769
in cognitive performance that may occur

473
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:34,990
with potential quote normalization of

474
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:36,750
function with regard to mood sleep

475
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,669
quality of life we do see some

476
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,860
and very importantly we see a

477
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:42,539
significant reduction in self-reported

478
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,389
use of conventional medications

479
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:47,370
specifically a 42% reduction in opiates

480
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:50,549
given the current crisis I think that's

481
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,159
worth noting why are they improved

482
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,628
symptom alleviation I feel better so I

483
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,969
can think more clearly that's certainly

484
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:59,220
a possibility product choice we know

485
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,600
that unlike recreational strains many of

486
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,610
our medical marijuana patients are

487
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,560
choosing strains that are high in other

488
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,000
constituents including cannabidiol and

489
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,948
in fact a number of these folks are on

490
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,110
high CBD containing products certain

491
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:11,549
cannabinoids may actually exert a direct

492
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,680
or an indirect effect on cognitive

493
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:15,899
performance age of the consumer these

494
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,278
folks let's just say these folks are not

495
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,778
necessarily within the window of

496
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,659
neurodevelopmental vulnerability they're

497
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:23,250
not 20 or 22 the average age is 50 as

498
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:25,379
opposed to our recreational sample

499
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,149
significantly younger all of this to be

500
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:29,730
followed with further research

501
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,169
so just for my last minute I will tell

502
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,329
you what else were up to we have an

503
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:35,338
fda-approved clinical trial of a whole

504
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:37,500
plant derived botanical high in CBD

505
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,389
sublingual tincture approved by the FDA

506
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,679
approved by the IRB unfortunately on

507
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:45,028
hold with the DEA that's four that's

508
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,370
another talk see the collector grounds

509
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:49,350
at home that's another talk we also have

510
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,370
very exciting an observational study of

511
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,259
veterans using medical marijuana

512
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,000
products we are basically looking at the

513
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,919
impact of cannabinoids on clinical state

514
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,778
and cognition particularly those

515
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,878
afflicted with PTSD given the

516
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:01,769
extraordinary need we're looking at

517
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,959
folks who are either marijuana naive

518
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:05,279
that is they haven't begun yet or folks

519
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,798
who are on a standard regimen of

520
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,389
cannabinoids or cannabis products who

521
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:10,588
are looking to add an additional product

522
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,049
and we'll follow them in much the same

523
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:14,548
way as these other studies so our next

524
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:16,288
steps we'll continue to examine the

525
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:17,879
impact of medical marijuana on cognition

526
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:20,908
quality of life and related variables

527
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,319
we're not stopping now no way we'll

528
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:24,360
continue to do research that helps to

529
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,099
inform empirically based guidelines for

530
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,459
use including dosing product selection

531
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,869
and age restrictions very exciting we're

532
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,850
exploring cannabinoid based therapy

533
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:35,158
specifically for veterans specifically

534
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:37,349
for women's health issues and a range of

535
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:38,940
other indications hopefully using other

536
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:41,579
products that are currently on the

537
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,960
market additional clinical trial models

538
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:44,609
are currently being developed to assess

539
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,620
the impact of products which have shown

540
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:48,240
efficacy anecdotally at this point I

541
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,619
would say researchers knowledge and

542
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,250
knowledge is power and I would implore

543
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:52,349
all of

544
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,058
who are invested in this particular area

545
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:56,009
and you wouldn't be sitting here if you

546
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:57,720
weren't that this is the most important

547
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,339
thing we can do help those of us who are

548
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,380
attempting to do research push the ball

549
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:04,918
down the field not to use a horrible

550
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,360
thing from our our previous session but

551
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,360
really move the ball down the field it

552
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,759
is up to us as scientists and clinicians

553
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,469
to inform our patients they're using

554
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,629
it's up to us to allow them to use

555
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,769
safely and wisely and to educate them

556
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,470
and to help them make good and sound

557
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:22,048
decisions for themselves thank you

558
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,048
[Applause]

559
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,889
you
