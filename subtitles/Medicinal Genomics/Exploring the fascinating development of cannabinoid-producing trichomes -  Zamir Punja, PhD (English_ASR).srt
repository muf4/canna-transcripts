1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
good afternoon everyone my name is amir

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,278
punja and i'm pleased to be here today

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,359
to

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,480
be able to talk to you about these

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,718
amazing

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,199
interesting and fascinating trichomes

7
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,119
that are produced on cannabis flowers

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,960
and what i'd like to do is show you some

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,000
incredible images that

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,439
if i can use the words uh awesome and

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,240
incredible

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,079
and beautiful and so on i'd like to be

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,358
able to share this information with you

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,118
today

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,039
feel free to have your cell phones ready

16
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,000
in case you want to take photographs of

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,840
these

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,480
amazing display of images that i'm going

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,719
to be showing you

20
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,238
and so here's a developing cannabis

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,320
plant this is a plant that's been grown

22
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,000
outdoors and the focus of this

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,238
presentation of course are the flowers

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,238
these are the flowers that are produced

25
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,679
at the terminal ends of these of these

26
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,359
particular plants

27
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,439
and similarly when plants are grown

28
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,679
indoors as you see here in this

29
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,479
controlled environment with lighting

30
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,039
the

31
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,000
cannabis flowers are produced in large

32
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,480
numbers

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,478
and uh will be ready for harvest uh in

34
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,719
in a very short period of time and of

35
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,478
course it's these cannabis flowers that

36
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,679
bear all of these trichomes that i'd

37
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:14,239
like to spend um the next 28 minutes or

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,600
so talking to you about

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,519
the work that i'll describe was

40
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,919
conducted on plants that were grown in

41
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,000
greenhouses and greenhouses such as this

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,560
where you see very controlled lighting

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,519
control nutrient regimes and control

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
growth overall and these plants are

45
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,759
basically going to be ready to be

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,680
harvested in about seven weeks

47
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
and just to illustrate how the cannabis

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,479
flower matures starting from when the

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,359
the lights are are switched off to give

50
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,399
a 12 hour for a period

51
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,959
over the course of three to four to

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,118
seven weeks these particular flowers or

53
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,879
inflorescences develop quite

54
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,959
dramatically as you can see here on the

55
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,879
bottom from about week three onwards

56
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,640
they increase tremendously

57
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,879
in size

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,519
we refer to these as flowers the correct

59
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,560
terminology is inflorescence which is

60
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,438
also used by some some individuals just

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,878
as flower buds but really what they are

62
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,120
are individual flowers that are

63
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,719
clustered together on this main stem and

64
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,120
i'll show you image in the next few

65
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,878
slides of these individual flowers

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,959
they're not true flowers in that they

67
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,359
don't produce petals but they have these

68
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,759
bracks and they have the stigmas which

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,319
are part of the the female flower

70
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,120
and so taking a closer look at the

71
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,280
inflorescence or the the flower head of

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
a cannabis plant you see the these

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,640
stigmas these are the female

74
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,280
structures that are going to be

75
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,958
collecting pollen uh if there's going to

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,360
be fertilization and i'll show you a

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,000
scanning electron micrograph of that so

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,280
this cannabis flower is pretty much a

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,199
cluster of individual smaller flowers

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,039
so these stigmas then as you see here

81
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,679
have these hair-like projections

82
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,000
and if you were to place pollen grains

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,760
as we did in this experiment you can see

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,680
the pollen grains germinate and they

85
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,399
will fertilize this particular stigmatic

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,159
surface and form seeds which is not

87
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,280
something we want in cannabis but we do

88
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,280
in hemp

89
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,120
in cannabis of course we cultivate just

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,199
the female flowers so there wouldn't be

91
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,519
any pollen germinating on these

92
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,799
particular on these particular stigmas

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,400
these are the plants that i showed you

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
earlier in the greenhouse this is week

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,120
seven ready for harvest you see the

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,680
stigmatic structures that are formed

97
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,640
here on the on the surface of the flower

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,280
and at harvest or after harvest these

99
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,598
are uh dried in this matter hung upside

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,439
down for a period of about five days at

101
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,839
which time then the flower buds will be

102
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,400
removed and they'll be ready for

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,360
packaging and shipping off for

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,519
use for medicine or recreational or

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,040
extraction

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,039
sometimes the flower buds are removed

107
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,878
prior to the dry and they're placed on

108
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,280
these trays and and put into a drying

109
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,919
room where then they'll be dried for

110
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,158
five days at which time these are then

111
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,598
ready for packaging up and shipping off

112
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,759
to to market

113
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,959
so this is what we refer to as the buds

114
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,798
which is the

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,400
essentially broken down inflorescence

116
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,400
that i showed you early on

117
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,039
now when the cannabis flower approaches

118
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,358
maturity those stigmas that i showed you

119
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,039
earlier take on sort of an orangey brown

120
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,279
color which indicates they're ready for

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,479
harvest but more importantly than that

122
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,000
you notice these trichomes these shiny

123
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,519
pinpoint like structures that are

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,079
covering the surface of the

125
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,680
inflorescence leaves and the bracks this

126
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
is the material that obviously that's

127
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,400
going to be

128
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
manufacturing and containing all of the

129
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,599
cannabinoids the thc the cbd and the

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,080
terpenes and that's the focus of my

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,080
study is to study the development of

132
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,319
these various trichomes on the cannabis

133
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,399
flower

134
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,879
so this is the cannabis bud in its in

135
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,599
its glory uh this is obviously ready to

136
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,639
be to be used for for recreational

137
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
purposes

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,400
you see the dried up stigmas here these

139
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,159
orangey brown structures and then of

140
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,120
course are the the trichomes which

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,000
you'll see close-ups off here uh in the

142
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,240
in the next in the next few minutes

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,918
so that was the focus of my work is to

144
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,519
study in detail what these trichomes

145
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,439
look like

146
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,680
here's a light uh

147
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,199
microscope image you can see again these

148
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
these spiny projections these other

149
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,680
trichomes they're they're produced on

150
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,960
these stocks you'll see close-up images

151
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
of these talks

152
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,519
when i go through my my slides

153
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
and most most producers will have seen

154
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,639
this

155
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,639
as they examine their their plants over

156
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,160
over a period of time so they're quite

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,918
obvious the trichomes are quite obvious

158
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,320
but what we wanted to do was to use the

159
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,000
scanning electron microscope this is a a

160
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,800
piece of equipment that actually

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,079
magnifies these trichomes considerably

162
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
when you look at the images on the

163
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,319
screen they're probably magnified over

164
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,720
100 000 times and this allows you to

165
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,079
really study detailed structure of what

166
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
these can

167
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,959
cannabis trichomes look like

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,199
now the scanning microscope is used

169
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,000
as shown here this is the the large

170
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,400
equipment various parts of it sample is

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,478
inserted into this chamber and the

172
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,638
images that are being produced can be

173
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,560
captured here on these computer screens

174
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,560
and then downloaded and saved and used

175
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,959
in presentations like the one i'm going

176
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
to show you today so this is what a

177
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,519
scanning electron microscope would look

178
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,439
like and within the machine itself

179
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,839
is the sample this is a tiny piece of

180
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,000
brack tissue that has trichomes

181
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:31,839
we coat this with gold or palladium very

182
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,240
very fine layer to allow these

183
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,879
electrons that are produced to be

184
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,439
scattered and emit images so the

185
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,839
electrons originate from an electron gun

186
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,478
and eventually what happens is the the

187
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:47,279
electrons that are released are detected

188
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,519
in the electron detector or images are

189
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,758
sent over to the screen where we can

190
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,359
then visualize what's going on in this

191
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,960
particular chamber

192
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,639
so i'll show you a couple of images done

193
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,478
by other researchers

194
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
where they looked at pollen grains these

195
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,399
are pollen grains of different plant

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,720
species you notice the very very fine

197
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,198
detail these spine-like structures the

198
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,120
size the shape all different in these

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
various different plant species but

200
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,639
notice how clear

201
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,319
and three-dimensional these particular

202
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,639
images are

203
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,319
and similarly if we use uh red blood

204
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,519
cells the red blood cells in your body

205
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
and my body

206
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,439
these are the platelets you can see sort

207
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,439
of a pancake shaped structure these are

208
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,519
magnified many many many times to show

209
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,918
you the actual

210
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,598
appearance of red blood cells in the

211
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,680
electron microscope

212
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,478
and so we wanted to use this technique

213
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,918
to study not just trichome development

214
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,560
but to look at things like trichome

215
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,318
density maturation and quality

216
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,720
and how potentially these various

217
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,000
features could be used to assess things

218
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,120
like thc and cbd that may be produced in

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,120
this particular plant

220
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,399
so once again this is the inflorescence

221
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,318
the entire structure

222
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,918
we're looking at very very small pieces

223
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,560
as you see here magnified over on the

224
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,560
right and these tiny spicules that you

225
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,319
see here are the trichomes that we're

226
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,918
now going to magnify in the scanning

227
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,240
electron microscope

228
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,159
and here's the first image this is the

229
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,319
trichomes the glandular trichomes that

230
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,560
are born on stocks as you see here this

231
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,879
is the surface of the the bract or the

232
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,120
leaf tissue this is a mid vein and you

233
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,919
can see how these trichome

234
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,720
glands or trichome heads appear under

235
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,719
the scanning electron microscope

236
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
now here's another image it shows you a

237
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,918
different type of trichome these are the

238
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
the the non-glandular trichomes what we

239
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,519
call the hairs

240
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,519
in the background these these structures

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,200
these little smiley faces these are the

242
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,959
stomata these are involved in

243
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,479
photosynthesis

244
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,958
excuse me this is how the plant takes up

245
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
carbon dioxide releases oxygen in

246
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,079
photosynthesis

247
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,640
these are other types of trichomes

248
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,160
called bubbles trichomes the trichomes

249
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,240
that i'm going to focus on are here

250
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,879
these large glandular circular

251
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,799
structures that we'll spend more time on

252
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,958
i'll show you a few close-up images of

253
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,639
these these hair-like structures

254
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,958
particularly on a leaf

255
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,559
this is a cannabis leaf that has many

256
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,958
many of these

257
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,239
non-glandular spines or hairs and you

258
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,319
can see

259
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
they do have a protective function they

260
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,600
will protect against insects and various

261
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,680
other other forms

262
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,120
but notice too that the leaves do have

263
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,439
these

264
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,159
globular round structures which are also

265
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,000
the the um sessile

266
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,519
trichomes that we'll we'll speak to in a

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,679
few minutes

268
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,240
a close-up if you're an insect this

269
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,159
would be a pretty dangerous territory to

270
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,240
enter into because of these these

271
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,799
various hairs that are meant to protect

272
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,680
the plant from attacked by by various

273
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,319
types of organisms and they're it's

274
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,319
quite effective

275
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,680
so back to the trichomes these are the

276
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,599
trichomes that the glandular trichomes

277
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,679
that we'll spend some time studying

278
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,240
these are the spiny projections that we

279
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,879
just saw that are most likely serving a

280
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,120
protective function

281
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,639
now these trichomes the heads of these

282
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,919
trichomes you can see

283
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,639
here in this image that is of a dried

284
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,799
cannabis flower or or a bud and you can

285
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,838
see how nicely they are distributed over

286
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,479
the surface of this particular sample uh

287
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,240
very uniform very nice and circular this

288
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,120
is a good sample this is a sample that

289
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,560
has probably the optimal amount of thc

290
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
and cbd and terpenes

291
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,639
here's a close-up of these

292
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,240
magnificent

293
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,679
trichome heads

294
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,039
and you can see they're surrounded by a

295
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,879
cuticle

296
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,240
these are individual uh individual

297
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,799
trichome heads

298
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,159
and i'll show you a close-up of the the

299
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,799
trichome head

300
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,519
sitting on the surface of a bract of

301
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,359
leaf you can almost visualize these

302
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,839
these miniature hot air balloons if you

303
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
wish that are starting to accumulate thc

304
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,720
and cbd

305
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,200
and all of this manufacturing is

306
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,839
occurring within the trichome

307
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,560
head itself the various enzymes are

308
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,399
produced and are working here within

309
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,639
within this particular structure

310
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,879
it's quite a magnificent site and the

311
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,199
next image that i'll show you is even

312
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,759
more magnificent because it shows you

313
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,680
now this particular tricom tricom head

314
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,519
is raised on a stock

315
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,559
and these stocks are very important in

316
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,720
not only pushing the trichome head

317
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,719
above the surface of the leaf but also

318
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,200
it's associated with maturation and

319
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,360
accumulation of various types of

320
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,120
cannabinoids so those of you working in

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,159
the medical field those of you using

322
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,278
cannabis for various purposes and using

323
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,600
it to make food or produce various types

324
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,919
of extracts this is the image that i

325
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,800
want you to visualize of this

326
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,399
magnificent trichome head that's sitting

327
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,719
on the surface of a stock

328
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,639
that's manufacturing all the materials

329
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,759
that this particular conference is all

330
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:54,159
about the thc the cbd various

331
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,159
cannabinoids and of course terpenes

332
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,399
i like to make an analogy of that

333
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,800
particular trichome

334
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,519
head to a lamp a lamp that's been

335
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,039
powered by electricity and the larger of

336
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,519
course the size of the bulb that you

337
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,159
place in here the larger is going to be

338
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,320
your amount of light that's emitted the

339
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,360
energy in a cannabis trichome comes from

340
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
the bottom of the plant the

341
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,278
photosynthesis that's being pushed up

342
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,359
and then the size of course of the

343
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,838
trichome head is going to illustrate how

344
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,159
much light or how much thc you're

345
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,160
actually going to be producing

346
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:29,039
so much so that an artist that i met a

347
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,199
few years ago was able to draw out these

348
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,759
particular trichome glands

349
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,920
on a stalk such as this and visualize

350
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,078
the light source emitting from a

351
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,559
trichome head and this would be the the

352
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,958
cannabinoids the thc and the cbd it'd be

353
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,518
a wonderful site to see these on our on

354
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,518
our streets

355
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,720
so here it is again uh these magnificent

356
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
structures on these stocks these other

357
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,839
trichome heads then that are going to be

358
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,919
producing these various types of

359
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,519
cannabinoids these are the small

360
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,278
bulbas trichomes that i talked about

361
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,720
that we don't really know what they're

362
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,120
they're doing so we're going to spend

363
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,320
most of our time now focusing on these

364
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,480
structures here

365
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,879
back in 2005 there was evidence

366
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,519
presented that the enzymes involved in

367
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,039
the manufacture of thc and cbd and

368
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,039
various other

369
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,199
terpenes are actually produced within

370
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,599
that globular structure which i'm

371
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,200
referring to as the trichome

372
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,600
trichome head so it's really a miniature

373
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,000
factory if you wish that's synthesizing

374
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,920
these very very important chemicals

375
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,480
so much so that you can visualize as

376
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,919
this trichome is being developed

377
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,240
the energy that's coming from the

378
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:41,039
epidermis and other cells in the plant

379
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,039
is being used to drive the manufacturer

380
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,599
of these cannabinoids within this

381
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,000
particular glandular structure that's

382
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,000
shown here

383
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,799
and then as i mentioned there is a stalk

384
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,639
that develops and this is very much

385
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,799
similar to a mushroom you can almost

386
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,120
visualize this mushroom gland starting

387
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,198
to form and the the stock cells are

388
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,360
derived from the epidermis

389
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,399
the layers of the leaf and so you can

390
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,759
see it pushing itself up

391
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,159
and as it gets

392
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,879
larger and more mature these stalks

393
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,519
continue to grow they grow upward

394
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,198
as the flower matures

395
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,839
and over time they get fairly large as

396
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,838
you see here these are all the cells

397
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,240
of the epidermis of the leaf cells that

398
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,399
have been used to form the stock this is

399
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,320
the large glandular head that's now

400
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,399
accumulating various types of

401
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
cannabinoids it's quite a quite an

402
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,320
impressive it's quite an impressive

403
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
structure

404
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,360
and here's a close-up this is now the

405
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,959
fully formed uh trichome head that's con

406
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
that contains all of the thc and

407
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,799
cannabinoids and various other things

408
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,278
that we want to use for medicine and

409
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,439
recreation here's the stock and you can

410
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,679
see it's attached here to the trichome

411
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,680
head

412
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,479
we looked at the development of these

413
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,720
stocks and the size of the trichome

414
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,639
heads over time and as the flower

415
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,639
matures going from three weeks to six

416
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,079
weeks what you see of course is an

417
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,560
increase in the in the length of the

418
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,958
stock and you also see an increase in

419
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,518
the size of the head that's being formed

420
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,559
on top of the stalks so maturation is

421
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,519
associated

422
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,198
with an expansion of the stock and an

423
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,600
expansion of the head

424
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:22,078
sort of like that hotter balloon that i

425
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,079
talked about

426
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,919
and so just to summarize then these uh

427
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,240
trichomes that we talked about they're

428
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,759
called capitate trichomes they're found

429
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,000
on both sides of the bracks the upper

430
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,000
and the lower they're circular in shape

431
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
surrounded by a cuticle and as the

432
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,039
flower matures these stalks begin to

433
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,360
elongate and the size of the head starts

434
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,599
to increase

435
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,079
this is a slide that illustrates there's

436
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,639
way more trichomes on the underside of

437
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,159
the bract than there is on the top i'm

438
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,159
not sure what the significance of this

439
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,559
is but you can see clearly there's way

440
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,120
more of these trichome heads here than

441
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:02,638
they are on the on the surface of the

442
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,639
of the um of the tissue

443
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,600
so we did some experiments where we

444
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,198
actually monitored and counted how many

445
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,320
of these trichome glands are actually

446
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,399
being produced and these are two

447
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,800
different strains and everywhere you see

448
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,799
these dots just signifies the the

449
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,799
location of these various trichomes and

450
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,120
you can see there's differences between

451
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,838
strains in terms of how many trichomes

452
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,919
are being produced

453
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,199
and this data is illustrated in a graph

454
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,799
form here

455
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,359
this is the number of trichomes over

456
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,439
time as the flowers mature the number of

457
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,600
trichomes goes up as you see to a

458
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
maximum at about seven weeks

459
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,560
and this just illustrates here the

460
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,040
underside

461
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,119
the underside of a trichome of a leaf

462
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,198
has way more trichomes than the upper

463
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,120
side as you see here so there is there

464
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,719
is a pretty significant difference on

465
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,839
whether you're looking at the the upper

466
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,839
surface of the lower surface

467
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,439
now there are some of these uh trichome

468
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,439
stocks that are absolutely crazy uh

469
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,680
here's one that is that is humongously

470
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,800
long uh there's another one right there

471
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,038
i'm not really sure what the

472
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,279
significance of this is but you can see

473
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,879
it's a it's a huge tricom stock compared

474
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,558
to some of the the other ones in the

475
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,559
background and whether there's a

476
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,279
significance to this or not i don't know

477
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,359
but

478
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:18,160
but the the importance of the stock is

479
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,279
that it's an indication of maturation of

480
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,120
those particular trichomes

481
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,879
so much so that this important study

482
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,438
that was published three years ago by

483
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,679
livingston and others demonstrated that

484
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,360
as these stocks get longer

485
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,679
the amount of terpenes and the amount of

486
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,558
cannabinoids that is that are produced

487
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,798
in the in the actual heads themselves

488
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,599
is increased significantly there's a

489
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:44,240
significant increase in the manufacture

490
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:47,119
of these terpenoids and cannabinoids as

491
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,240
a result of elongation of the stocks and

492
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,558
the reason for that is that as the

493
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,640
trichome stocks begin to grow

494
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,319
so do the number of secretory cells the

495
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
number of secretory cells that you see

496
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,879
here at the bottom of these trichome

497
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,640
heads the numbers go up

498
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,559
so that as the the stocks begin to

499
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,400
elongate and you have trichomes that are

500
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,720
maturing you have more of these

501
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,480
secretory cells that are producing all

502
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,880
these cannabinoids which is shown here

503
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,519
in this in this light blue color so this

504
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,679
is the thc and the cbd produced within

505
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,319
these glandular structures and here are

506
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,679
the stocks the stocks that we looked at

507
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,519
a few minutes ago

508
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,280
so quite a fascinating

509
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,279
developmental change over time

510
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,960
the other thing that happens as the

511
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,199
trichome

512
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,360
heads mature is that you can see a

513
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,919
difference in fluorescence under uv

514
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,599
light so when you shine uv light here on

515
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,520
the right you can actually pick out

516
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,759
where these glandular heads are as

517
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,558
opposed to where you have normal visible

518
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,038
light

519
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,399
and the reason for that is that these

520
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,319
trichome heads of course contain

521
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,880
cannabinoids which fluoresce at a

522
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,159
wavelength of around 430 nanometers and

523
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,039
so you can actually pick out these

524
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,360
individual trichome heads as shown here

525
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:03,519
and this was also demonstrated in this

526
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,519
paper that i described by by livingston

527
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,519
so here's a close-up of one of these

528
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,359
trichome heads here the secretory cells

529
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,480
you can see on the outside and they're

530
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,240
pumping out

531
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,640
these cannabinoids that are accumulating

532
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,798
in this hot air balloon as it starts to

533
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,240
develop and you can see here the stock

534
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:24,879
that the um the head is attached to

535
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,038
now this is the the base of the

536
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,559
uh or the top of the actual stock you

537
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,640
can see here this is where the the

538
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,200
trichome head was attached and in the

539
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,360
next image i show you a cross section

540
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,360
through this particular stock that shows

541
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,279
you it's it's consists of these various

542
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,119
cells so these are the cells that make

543
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,639
up the stock and this is this is where

544
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,918
the nutrients the photosynthetics are

545
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,919
going to flow

546
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,400
through the stock up into the trichome

547
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,000
head to provide energy for the

548
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,000
manufacturing of these various

549
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,480
cannabinoids it's quite an amazing

550
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,480
process

551
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,640
and here's the other side this is the

552
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,120
underside of the actual head and this is

553
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,440
where the trichome stock would attach

554
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,439
to the bottom of the of the trichome

555
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,440
head

556
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,840
this was illustrated quite nicely in

557
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,240
this paper that was published a few

558
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,639
years ago it indicates where the stock

559
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,120
is actually being attached to the

560
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,400
underside of the trichome head and you

561
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,599
can see right here the point of

562
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,080
connection

563
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,000
where the stock ends and the the head is

564
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,158
starting to form

565
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,240
and we can show that in this schematic

566
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,400
representation where you've got the

567
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,480
trichome head with the cuticle these are

568
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,038
the secretory cells that we talked about

569
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,240
these numbers go up as the length of the

570
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,359
trichome

571
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,359
stock increases and this balloon

572
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,839
structure starts to increase

573
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,558
the accumulation of various types of

574
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,558
cannabinoids

575
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,280
so here's a underside view of the

576
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,600
secretory cells you can see them right

577
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,599
here and they're all secreting various

578
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,719
cannabinoids that are filling this

579
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,719
particular

580
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,720
balloon or cavity over

581
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,319
time and here's a

582
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:05,679
a dried

583
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,879
cannabis

584
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,840
trichome stock as you see here with the

585
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,240
actual

586
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,240
trichome head still attached and you can

587
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,480
see you can almost visualize the

588
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,798
contents here which is obviously all the

589
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,360
the cannabinoids and

590
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:21,359
terpenes

591
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,678
now these things do become detached many

592
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,798
of you know that you can collect these

593
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,480
various

594
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,879
tricum heads and use it to make things

595
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,360
like hashes and so on you can see the

596
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,440
point of attachment of the stock

597
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,959
these things come off and here's another

598
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,759
illustration where it's come off from

599
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,840
the stock and now you've got your entire

600
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:46,000
tricom head that contains all of these

601
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:47,439
cannabinoids in it again very similar to

602
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,319
to a hot air balloon that's that's

603
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,320
become detached

604
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,440
so just to summarize the stock

605
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,079
development is an important part of

606
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,558
maturation uh when these stocks start to

607
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,558
develop you start to see tremendous

608
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,240
increase in the accumulation of these

609
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,319
various cannabinoids

610
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,480
what causes the stocks to elongate we

611
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,519
don't know why are some stocks longer

612
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,200
than others we don't know and why are we

613
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,599
why do we have more

614
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,200
trichomes on the underside of a bright

615
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,959
as opposed to the upper surface we're

616
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,960
not sure so there's still a lot of

617
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,079
research that still has to be done to

618
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,120
try to resolve these various aspects of

619
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,119
trichome development

620
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,200
and of course the heads do dehist the

621
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,200
process of the

622
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,679
the um glands coming off is called the

623
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,840
histance and of course uh if you if you

624
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,840
harvest these things and cause damage

625
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:42,000
then these trichome heads can break

626
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:44,079
off here's an example of a good sample a

627
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,359
sample that's well preserved you can see

628
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,759
all the trichome heads are still

629
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,558
attached this is a dried cannabis flower

630
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:54,480
and this is a flower where there's been

631
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:56,000
some abuse or not well taken care of and

632
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,120
you can see where all the heads have

633
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,839
broken off

634
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,918
leaving much less thc and other

635
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,399
cannabinoids in this particular sample

636
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,080
so have to be careful when we handle

637
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,600
these cannabis flowers

638
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,038
so the last thing i'd like to talk about

639
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,678
is the maturation

640
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,079
there is a phase where the trichomes

641
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,080
literally undergo a maturation or

642
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,678
senescence process and this is

643
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,558
accompanied by the accumulation of a

644
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,640
brown color within the the trichome

645
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,599
heads themselves and so we wanted to

646
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,320
study this under the electron microscope

647
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,439
here's the mature trichome head you can

648
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,759
actually see

649
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,640
little droplets of exudate starting to

650
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,919
form this is where now the resin is

651
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,840
starting to become pushed out of the um

652
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,840
the trichome head itself

653
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,678
and we can actually see that because

654
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,480
what happens is that when the resin

655
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,360
comes off it causes the surface of the

656
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,880
trichome head to become sticky and so

657
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,719
these little heads start to stick to one

658
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,919
another as you see here

659
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,919
and those of you that have handled

660
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,759
cannabis flowers that are developing you

661
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,759
know the sticky residue that's what's

662
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:02,960
being secreted out of those trichome

663
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,599
heads

664
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,038
and here's a close-up this bulging this

665
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,558
is the resin that's being actually

666
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,319
pushed out

667
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,798
through the through the head through the

668
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,798
cuticle

669
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,519
and here you can see actually the

670
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,400
exudate actually dribbling down

671
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,158
pouring down from the actual trichome

672
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,200
head itself it's it's quite quite an

673
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,880
amazing

674
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,840
view when you look at it here under the

675
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,840
scanning microscope

676
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,000
and what happens of course is because of

677
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,839
the sticky nature of the surface you

678
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,720
have what i consider these hot cross

679
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,639
buns

680
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,319
these trichome heads sticking together

681
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,720
as a result of the resin that's being

682
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,720
produced

683
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,440
and here again you get these large blobs

684
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,839
this is all because of resin that's come

685
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,558
off these strike heads have stuck to one

686
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,399
another to form these blobs and here's

687
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:55,038
another indication of that these are

688
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,159
large structures that are caused by the

689
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:02,079
exudation of that resin

690
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,080
and this happens at at maturity

691
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,799
and again just a low power shot to show

692
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,120
you the the sticking together of the

693
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,679
trichome heads as a result of secretion

694
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,678
of resin

695
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,558
the other thing that happens of course

696
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,120
is there is this process of senescence

697
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,119
which i consider aging this on the right

698
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,879
is a trichome that's starting to age on

699
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,359
the left is a trichome that's still

700
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,320
fairly fairly young in the developmental

701
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,000
process

702
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,879
and when you take a look at these aging

703
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,038
trichomes the actual heads themselves

704
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,360
you notice there's a wrinkling of the

705
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,119
surface of the cuticle almost like a

706
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,599
sort of a prune

707
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:42,798
shaped image as you see this is a very

708
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,639
very high powered magnification picture

709
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,278
this is what happens over time the

710
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,600
resonance material starts to condense

711
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,359
to form this cakey-like substance

712
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,558
and then over time it looks like this

713
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,839
this is a completely senescent or aging

714
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,918
trichome

715
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,000
head that has the resonance material

716
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,080
just completely sort of collapsed and

717
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,679
and baked down on the surface of the

718
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,918
trichome

719
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,080
and you can see this uh close up this

720
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,400
entire wrinkling is all the resonance

721
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,158
material the cuticle is broken off and

722
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,278
this is an older

723
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,559
aged

724
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,079
mature

725
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,960
trichome

726
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,960
head that's shown

727
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,960
any when you take a low power image of

728
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,599
this particular

729
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,000
view what you do see is

730
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,399
that these trichome heads that have

731
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,359
senesced or old can be seen here as the

732
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,360
shriveled up images

733
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,319
so again just to summarize droplets of

734
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,600
resident resin are released from these

735
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,918
trichome heads

736
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,519
causes them to become sticky

737
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,640
and it results in the formation of these

738
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,558
various blobs and the resin then causes

739
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,880
these particular trichome heads to

740
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:54,639
collapse which is basically the last

741
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,880
phase which is the the senescence

742
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,720
here's an example of a good

743
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,039
sample on the left where the trichome

744
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,919
heads are all intact on the right is a

745
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,440
sample that isn't uh processed very well

746
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,679
the trachum heads have broken off

747
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,278
there's very few of them left

748
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,759
the scanning microscope can actually

749
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,759
show you differences in quality between

750
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,640
a good sample on the left and a poor

751
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,640
sample on the right

752
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,398
the other thing that can be done

753
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,720
something we're looking at now before i

754
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,199
end is is using computer assisted

755
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,679
technology to determine the numbers of

756
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,159
trichomes on cannabis flowers and the

757
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,080
various types of maturation

758
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,159
phases so what we've done here is

759
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,480
circled the various trichome heads

760
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,480
whether they're mature in the red

761
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,558
whether they're immature in the white

762
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,919
and then the mature ones in between

763
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,158
which are the blue

764
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,720
and so using these computer enhanced

765
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,880
systems we can almost tell where

766
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,720
these various trichome heads are and how

767
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,559
many they are in a very very short

768
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,519
period of time and that's something that

769
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,519
we'd like to work on to demonstrate

770
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:02,240
how computer assisted technology can be

771
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:03,918
used to assess maturation of trichomes

772
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,440
so i'll end here with some images that

773
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,038
are generated through this computer

774
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,640
assistance method

775
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,640
these circles illustrate where the

776
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,120
trichomes are located you can see the

777
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,880
differences between these two samples

778
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,199
here's another image generated by the

779
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,360
computer that shows you the various

780
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,640
types of trichomes that are found

781
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,519
and then finally

782
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,080
this one that illustrates the senescence

783
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,960
mature trichome glands that are shown in

784
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:31,439
brown uh compared to the previous so i i

785
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,120
think this this image analysis using

786
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,679
computer technology is going to be very

787
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,879
important for us to decipher trichome

788
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,880
numbers and maturation

789
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,960
so finally uh trichomes are fascinating

790
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,360
structures i hope i've shown you some

791
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,120
amazing images to illustrate that

792
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,359
lots of things we don't know what what

793
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,439
initiates uh their development is their

794
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,199
effect of light other signals

795
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,640
why do these starcom stocks develop to

796
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,480
various extents

797
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,240
and can we use this kind of technology

798
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,319
to assess

799
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,919
trichome development and optimal time of

800
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,038
harvest that would be very very

801
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,799
important from a commercial perspective

802
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,278
various individuals have contributed to

803
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,440
this research various funding agencies

804
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:15,599
and various people have helped me with

805
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
collection of this these various images

806
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,960
so i hope what i've done with this

807
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,919
presentation is show you some of the

808
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,840
spectacular uh images of cannabis

809
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,520
trichome development and the various

810
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,918
things that go on that i think are going

811
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,398
to be commercially extremely important

812
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,559
um i'm sorry i wasn't able to attend the

813
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,719
meeting here um i hope this

814
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,798
this presentation will give you some

815
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,319
ideas for for thought

816
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,879
if you have questions please send them

817
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,960
along i'm going to be at my computer

818
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,440
right now as we speak you can send me

819
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,038
emails at punja p-u-n-j-a at sfu.ca and

820
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,000
i'll be happy to take questions answer

821
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:53,519
these either right away or any time when

822
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,278
you've had time to digest this

823
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,720
particular information

824
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,398
thank you for your attention and i wish

825
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,558
you all the best in the rest of the

826
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,558
conferences thank you
