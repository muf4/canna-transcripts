his kmed 2018 presentation featured

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,360
several amazing images

50
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,640
zamir's team captured using an electron

microscope

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,038
the image of powdery mildew mycelia

53
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,598
wrapped around a cannabis trichome

54
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,519
is one i won't soon forget be sure to

in addition to his work on plant

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,520
diseases zamir's team has used their

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,159
electron microscope to investigate the

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,640
structure

61
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,280
of cannabis trichomes and will present

62
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,439
those findings at cam ed 2021

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,759
i expect we will see even more amazing

64
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,318
images during that presentation

65
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,518
in fact zamir gave us a few sneak peek

topics discussed on the podcast include

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,200
how diseases

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,280
infect and affect cannabis plants

72
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,719
which cultivation methods are more prone

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,759
to infection

74
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:55,199
how to breed for pathogen resistance

75
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,280
which pathogens pose a risk to consumers

76
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,759
and how each of the four observed

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,640
cannabis trichome structures differ

78
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,158
and what each might be responsible for

79
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,759
before we get to my conversation

80
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,479

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
good afternoon samir thanks for joining

112
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,840
us

113
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,918
oh thanks ben it's a pleasure to be here

114
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,758
and talk to you

115
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,439
absolutely and i'm really excited to

116
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
talk with you today because

117
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,199
i know you've done a lot of research

118
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,759
into plant pathogens

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,600
excuse me plant pathogens and diseases

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,680
that affect the cannabis plant

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,759
and coincidentally our team here at

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,400
medicinal genomics has developed

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,040
some qpcr dna based tests that can

124
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,120
identify some of the very same species

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
you've worked on so although i'm

126
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,240
familiar with some of the species and

127
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
i've read about how they can

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,720
affect the cannabis plant we don't get

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
to work with any actual plants here

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,160
in our lab like you do so i'm really

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
interested in getting your

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
perspective it's really fascinating to

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,880
me

134
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,719
so um with that i think maybe a great

135
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,240
place to start is with fusarium because

136
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
i know that your team

137
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,840
recently published uh two two papers on

138
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
that fungi

139
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,399
so um i was wondering can you tell us a

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,120
bit about fusarium and how it affects

141
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,120
the cannabis plant

142
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,120
yeah thanks so we started working on

143
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,680
these various diseases about

144
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
four years ago and the first thing we

145
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,800
did was conduct

146
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,120
surveys of a range of different

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,960
producers out here in

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
in primarily in british columbia

149
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,959
although we did get a chance to get some

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,680
samples from back east in ontario

151
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,120
and the first disease that popped out uh

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,319
the one that was the most visible was

153
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,918
fiserium

154
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,519
and on the plants on flowering plants

155
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,918
fusarium will show up as

156
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,319
sort of a yellowing of the lower leaves

157
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,839
which is then followed by

158
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,120
in many cases wilting and eventually if

159
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,079
the disease progresses

160
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,360
it it'll kill the plants so in many

161
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,879
other crops it's referred to as

162
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,879
physiorum yellows

163
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,879
but what we saw in cannabis was more or

164
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,279
less a root infection

165
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,120
and a crown infection and so when you

166
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,239
see a plant that's yellowing that's that

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,160
that's wilting

168
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,079
if you examine the the roots they're

169
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,919
going to be brown uh some of them

170
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,599
may be rotted off and then if you look

171
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,599
at the crown you'll see sort of a

172
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,759
pinkish orange

173
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,520
maybe even a dark brown discoloration

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,360
that would indicate that it is

175
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,799
it is a fusarium so you see on on those

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,360
flowering plants but even more

177
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,038
importantly we found it on vegetatively

178
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,560
propagated cuttings so

179
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,240
you know a lot of growers obviously

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,959
start their plants from cuttings and

181
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
and in fusarium we saw a lot of damping

182
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,799
off

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,639
and so in other words rather than the

184
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,560
cuttings going ahead and rooting

185
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,680
they were starting to literally fall

186
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,759
over uh

187
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,519
and they rotted and that came as a

188
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
surprise to us and so when we isolated

189
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,159
from there we found a lot of fusarium

190
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,279
and going back to your earlier point the

191
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,120
main species is fusarium oxysporum

192
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,119
which is the the fusarium that causes a

193
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,399
lot of wilt in in many other plants like

194
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,840
tomatoes and

195
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,799
and basil and lettuce um in addition we

196
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,519
found

197
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,680
solana solana is the one that sort of

198
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,758
causes more of the damping off and there

199
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
and the root rot and then the third

200
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,000
species that we found just recently this

201
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,959
past

202
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,879
year was fusarium polypherotum and that

203
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,758
one actually moves up the plant it

204
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,519
actually

205
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,879
causes the crown infection but then you

206
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,519
start seeing discoloration

207
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,918
pretty much all the way to the top and

208
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,198
so

209
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,799
those three species you can sort of tell

210
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,560
by looking whether it's a crown

211
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,478
infection a root infection or whether

212
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,639
it's progressing up the plant but

213
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,719
i think as you mentioned the diagnostic

214
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,079
the pcr diagnostic tests are going to be

215
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,479
the most accurate

216
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,758
in telling which of those three species

217
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,360
are actually present

218
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,160
uh in a crop now you mentioned that

219
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,800
in flowering it can kind of present as

220
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,680
having yellowing leaves um

221
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
are there signs and symptoms that can be

222
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,918
visible

223
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,918
sort of before that flowering stage

224
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,159
the the only symptom i would say is a

225
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,598
stunting so in other words your plants

226
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,720
haven't grown to the same height that

227
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,240
they should have

228
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,919
they they don't look like they're you

229
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
know really happy maybe they you think

230
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,279
it might be a fertilizer problem

231
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,918
uh it ends up that it's actually

232
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,359
physarium that's infected the roots and

233
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,959
potentially started infecting the crown

234
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,439
interesting and you're saying that you

235
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,079
know cuttings can obviously take the

236
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,839
if a mother plant is infected can kind

237
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,359
of take it into the cuttings

238
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,958
would the mother plants really be

239
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,440
showing any signs and symptoms

240
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,918
or is that sort of is that sort of the

241
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
problem

242
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,680
so that that's where the problem

243
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,918
actually started the mother plants tend

244
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,719
to not show any symptoms

245
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,319
and so we think that fusarium originated

246
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,759
i don't know many years ago even before

247
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,560
we started sampling

248
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,240
four years ago from mother plants or

249
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,359
disease plants that were maybe passed

250
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,360
along

251
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,879
from one grower to another or from from

252
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,560
one friend to another

253
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,559
unknowingly that they already had some

254
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,479
fusarium probably in the roots or maybe

255
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,958
in the crown

256
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
and then those mothers are grown up and

257
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,919
if they're really diseased you will get

258
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,599
the mothers dying

259
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,199
they will collapse and obviously then

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,480
you know it's time to get rid of them

261
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,720
but if you don't don't see those

262
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,320
symptoms and you take cuts from them

263
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
you have the you run the risk of

264
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
actually transmitting fusarium into the

265
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,240
next crop

266
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
and i suppose and you can correct me if

267
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,639
i'm wrong but if if you did have a

268
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,599
an otherwise healthy mother plant that

269
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,600
develops the

270
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
infection later on in life you wouldn't

271
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,278
really see that

272
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
that stunting on the initial growing

273
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,600
phase

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,440
is that fair to say yes correct

275
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,120
um and and you know it's it's hard to

276
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,839
tell when a mother is is

277
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,879
well too old if i can say that we tend

278
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,040
to recommend

279
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,799
mother plants be tossed out after six

280
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,480
months to a year

281
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,599
and not keep them for four or five years

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,440
as some some producers might be doing

283
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,839
at that stage i think you might start

284
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,519
seeing symptoms of yellowing and

285
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,519
and stunting in which case you know it's

286
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,000
time to get rid of them

287
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,959
right and i know that it's it's not

288
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
uncommon for

289
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,679
a flowering plant to sort of you know

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,519
have some yellowing leaves as

291
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,599
it sort of directs more nutrients into

292
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,240
creating buds and things like that so

293
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,120
is there more of a a telltale sign of

294
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,200
you know what's

295
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,240
kind of typical yellowing versus a

296
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
fusarium infection

297
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,600
yeah so most of the the most of the

298
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,838
infections that we do see

299
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,720
that are quite severe would probably be

300
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,640
within the first two weeks of flower

301
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
that's when the plant is producing you

302
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,000
know trying to get a lot of its its

303
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,838
energy into the flowering phase

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
and it puts a lot of stress on those on

305
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,120
that particular plant

306
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,800
and that's when you start seeing the

307
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,639
yellowing and the wilting

308
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,958
and in many cases those plants actually

309
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,159
die before they get into full flower

310
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,319
so when you've got a plant that's in

311
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,078
full flower and it may be showing a

312
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,320
little bit of yellowing here and there

313
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,239
that could just be nutrition or

314
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
environmental stress or something else

315
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
if it's fusarium it's probably going to

316
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,838
go down within the first three weeks of

317
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,959
flower

318
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,120
wow and now is there anything you can do

319
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,439
once once you've identified a fusion

320
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360
infection

321
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,120
yeah so the first place to start is with

322
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,720
the cuttings um

323
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,560
if you know your mom your mother plants

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,440
are clean or there's a way to test those

325
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,759
we actually haven't

326
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,519
haven't developed the testing method yet

327
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,799
to test the mothers to see if they're

328
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,078
carrying fusarium and

329
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,319
part of it is you know the plants are

330
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,958
large and and we don't know what part to

331
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,879
actually sample for the for the analysis

332
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,319
but if you're you know if you know the

333
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,078
the history of the mother plant

334
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,839
and you're you're you know it's a good

335
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,679
source and it's clean

336
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,680
um the first place to test would be the

337
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,679
cuttings so cuttings start

338
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,719
dying they're not rooting well it could

339
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,679
be fusarium

340
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,920
present there um we're looking at a

341
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,359
number of biological control agents

342
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,039
that are registered so for example

343
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,680
trichoderma

344
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,078
gliocladium there's products out there

345
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,078
that

346
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,958
are quite effective in keeping the

347
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,879
fusarium on the cuttings at bay

348
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,119
provided they're added early so in other

349
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,559
words once the cuts are made

350
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,320
the cuts could either be dipped in

351
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,359
fusarium or sorry in

352
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,560
in the trichoderma or the the

353
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,440
gliocladium

354
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,199
or you can apply a drench before the

355
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,040
cuttings are actually rooted to actually

356
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,040
prevent the infection from getting in

357
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,519
and now so how big or widespread is um

358
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
is the fusamur fusarium problem is it

359
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,320
something that's pretty common

360
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
in cannabis cultivation

361
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
yeah so it's interesting uh the short

362
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,919
answer to that is the more we look the

363
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,319
more we find

364
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,559
um i think i would i would have to say

365
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,480
out of the 12 or 15

366
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,838
commercial producers i've sampled every

367
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,000
one of them had

368
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,360
uh either very very trace amounts of

369
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,399
fusarium to

370
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,639
fusarium in about 30 of their plants so

371
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,039
i i think it's it's there uh it's had a

372
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,879
chance to sort of move around

373
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,240
and depending on the the variety or the

374
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,360
strain depending on the growing

375
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,600
conditions

376
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,519
it may or may not be a major problem or

377
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,079
end up it could end up being a major

378
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,839
problem

379
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,359
um in some grower growth facilities

380
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,279
yeah and you bring up an interesting

381
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,278
point so do

382
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,799
environmental conditions kind of play a

383
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,600
role in this i know that

384
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,078
you know for example with powdery mildew

385
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,560
um

386
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,439
you know if humidity is really high that

387
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,039
tends to

388
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,880
to breed more powdery mildew where if

389
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,599
you have sort of your levels in check

390
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,639
it's

391
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,360
it's less of an issue is there a similar

392
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,879
kind of trigger

393
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,680
environmental trigger for cerium

394
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,720
um so fusarium it you know it grows over

395
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,679
a pretty wide range

396
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,680
anyway from 20 to 30 degrees celsius or

397
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,838
you're looking at 75 to 90

398
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,159
90 degrees fahrenheit i would say

399
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,399
overall that as it gets warmer

400
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,919
as you start hitting the the seven the

401
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,399
90 to 95 degree

402
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,519
range uh physiom can be quite a bit

403
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,679
worse

404
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,039
than it would be at lower temperatures

405
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,039
it also seems to like

406
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,799
moisture and of course that's kind of

407
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,159
hard to avoid because we tend to you

408
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,039
know really water the plants and make

409
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,519
sure the cuts

410
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,039
are well watered freezer and will grow

411
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,240
and actually it'll spread

412
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,120
with water so you can have spores moving

413
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,560
from

414
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,720
let's say a propagation room where

415
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,159
you've got cuttings uh into an

416
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,480
adjoining room if the water is being

417
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,240
recirculated you can actually get fuseum

418
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,000
spores moving from one location to

419
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,120
another

420
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,480
wow and i know you you mentioned that

421
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,159
there could be some treatments that you

422
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,320
do to the cuttings after you take them

423
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,480
from the mother to sort of maybe

424
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,480
prevent an infection but so say you

425
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,480
already are a few weeks into

426
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,839
uh flowering and you're seeing those

427
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,959
signs and it looks

428
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,399
it doesn't look good is it a lost cause

429
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,958
at that point or is there anything you

430
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
can do to sort of salvage that plant

431
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,479
yeah i know i would go in and pull those

432
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,720
plants out particularly the ones that

433
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,480
are yellowing and starting to weld

434
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,000
there's always a concern that as the

435
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,759
fusarium develops on the roots

436
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,120
and the crowns it's going to produce a

437
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,519
lot of spores

438
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,440
uh and and if you've got plants let's

439
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,959
say sitting on the same table or in the

440
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,279
same growing area

441
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,159
you could have spread as i mentioned in

442
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,240
the water

443
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,159
but interesting enough it also moves in

444
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,240
the air so if you've got

445
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,759
fans moving spores back and forth you

446
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,919
could actually be moving

447
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,000
uh inoculum from that disease plant or

448
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,278
disease plants into other areas in the

449
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,958
growing room so

450
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,320
my recommendation plants look bad

451
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,239
they're yellowing

452
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,000
grab them take them out bag them and and

453
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,560
toss them

454
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,320
well that's interesting so does that

455
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,719
mean that like spores could

456
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,560
even infect maybe if there were some

457
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,720
plants that were further

458
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,559
further in their development they have

459
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,399
full flowers could it actually infect

460
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,479
the flowers themselves

461
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,399
okay so yeah so that's a good news bad

462
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,480
news story the good news is that

463
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,440
uh if the spores do move around they

464
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,480
will not infect

465
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,320
uh plants uh at flower or even at a

466
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,240
younger stage this fusarium seems to

467
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,759
like to get in early

468
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,278
so it'll get in with the cuttings it

469
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,079
might get in that in the vegetative

470
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,399
stage

471
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,439
but once you've sort of passed that uh

472
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,000
the plants seem to be

473
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,360
able to withstand the the um the

474
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,120
infection level so

475
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,039
if the plants have made it through at a

476
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,799
certain stage you're probably not going

477
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,799
to worry about freezer and moving around

478
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,519
too much from plant to plant

479
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,000
but we have found that if spores are

480
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,759
produced let's say there's a plant dying

481
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and it's producing spores at the base at

482
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,120
the crown those spores once they get up

483
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,440
into the air

484
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,720
can actually infect flowers of a

485
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,880
neighboring plant so if you've got

486
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,639
plants a little bit further down

487
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,198
those spores can actually get up into

488
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,600
the flower head and establish themselves

489
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,479
uh in in the flower if the humidity is

490
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,639
right you know

491
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,680
if it's if it's really humid and if it's

492
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,600
hot

493
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,799
and so we've seen what we call fusarium

494
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,720
flower flower rot or fiserium bud rot

495
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,919
which in many ways looks a lot like

496
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,759
botrytis

497
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,198
but it's only when you isolate and

498
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,839
recover that you actually find out it's

499
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:01,039
not botrytis and it's actually fusarium

500
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,798
wow and now would that pose

501
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:07,359
any health harm or health risk to

502
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,480
consumers if uh flour was infected with

503
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,519
that

504
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,798
yeah so yeah so

505
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,798
and you're probably familiar with

506
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,480
fusarium head blight and cereals and

507
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,119
fusarium and corn

508
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,120
we know uh many of these species things

509
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,879
like physiomoxisporum can

510
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,279
produce mycotoxins and there is a risk

511
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
that that if you had severe infections

512
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,798
by fusarium

513
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,600
in the flowers that that could cause

514
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,200
certain mycotoxins to accumulate

515
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,918
because we've only just published those

516
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,240
two papers in the last month or so

517
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,440
i think the regulatory agencies and and

518
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,440
i think in general

519
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,440
the community hasn't quite recognized

520
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,840
that there is a potential for

521
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
uh physiorum species to infect the

522
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,798
flower again

523
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,639
it's not something that i would i would

524
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,079
necessarily raise a flag and say you

525
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,840
know this is the end of the

526
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,439
the cultivation of cannabis i think it's

527
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,199
a it's it's

528
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,720
it's there i think we're gonna find a

529
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,279
little bit of it i would say

530
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,319
maybe one percent of the flower could

531
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,160
have fusarium but

532
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,000
it's something that i think we need to

533
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,880
be aware of and certainly

534
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,400
um there should be screening methods for

535
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,360
detecting some of the specific

536
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,120
microtoxins produced by fusarium

537
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,719
yeah that's i mean that's really

538
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,359
interesting because i

539
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,679
i went back and i and i re-watched your

540
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,639
your lecture from canada 2018 where you

541
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,640
were talking about

542
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,679
a lot about fusarium and some of the

543
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,080
other pathogens that can affect cannabis

544
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,120
and the thing that stood out to me is

545
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,359
that you were mentioning that

546
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,000
penicillium which is another species

547
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,279
that can affect the plant um is sort of

548
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,160
a similar thing where it can

549
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,038
produce mycotoxins in the um in the

550
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
flower

551
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:48,000
and i know that you know regulatory

552
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,160
agencies aren't specifically looking for

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,759
um penicillium or fusarium um

554
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,519
they'd be kind of covered under the

555
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,879
total yeast and mold umbrella

556
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,240
but much like with with aspergillus

557
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,080
i mean unless you're specifically

558
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,880
looking for that it can sort of

559
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,759
get underneath that that total threshold

560
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
and

561
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,720
you know maybe actually be

562
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,880
posing a risk to consumers so that's a

563
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,640
little um a little concerning and maybe

564
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,400
something that regulatory agencies need

565
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,960
to take another look at

566
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
do you agree

567
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,200
yeah so uh you know you guys at

568
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,000
medicinal genomics were the first to

569
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
actually show that

570
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,759
some of these uh penicillium species

571
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,720
like penicillium citronym

572
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,679
and and others are potential microtoxin

573
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,919
producers i mean

574
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,240
this was was work that was published

575
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,640
three or four years ago by kevin and so

576
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,640
on

577
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,160
and his group and that sort of alerted

578
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,200
me to the fact that we should be

579
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,558
testing our our cannabis flower for for

580
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,798
penicillium as well

581
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,599
and sure enough we we found penicillium

582
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,440
it's

583
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,879
you know penicillium is everywhere uh

584
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,120
it's found uh in

585
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,320
in soil it's found on plant material

586
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,519
that's starting to

587
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,279
to decompose it's found in compost

588
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,359
it's found in people's homes like it's

589
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,440
not something that you necessarily can

590
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,399
can kind of eliminate from the growing

591
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,919
environment

592
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,440
but what tends to happen is when you've

593
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,000
got a lot of it building up so let's say

594
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,320
you've got

595
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,720
some plant material that's decaying and

596
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,798
producing a lot of spores or the floors

597
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,839
aren't necessarily kept very clean

598
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:20,319
or um the filtering system or uv

599
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,158
system isn't collecting all the spores

600
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,798
those penicillium spores land

601
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,520
on the flowers and they can stay there

602
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,119
and

603
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,200
after a while they can start growing and

604
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,879
producing more spores

605
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,360
which in turn can then maybe lead to

606
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,080
certain mycotoxins that are produced by

607
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,959
by the penicillium species so i know

608
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,359
penicillium is

609
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,558
is a big component of the overall yeast

610
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,158
and mole count

611
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,079
but as you mentioned all they do is

612
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,679
count numbers right so once you get you

613
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,480
you're under a certain limit you're good

614
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,200
to go but uh they could potentially be

615
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,240
mycotoxins building up in there

616
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,720
yeah no that's and and you

617
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,480
mentioned sort of if you have plant

618
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,880
material collecting and it

619
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,640
reminded me of that slide that you had

620
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,400
showed

621
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
of a plate that you had left out in a

622
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,519
trim room and just seeing the uh

623
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,960
the sheer amount of molds and things

624
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:15,038
that grew on that

625
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,319
um that was that was pretty

626
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,839
pretty shocking to see i i was shocked

627
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,240
when i when i saw that and

628
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,839
just to clarify there in the trim room

629
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,759
you know those those flowers and those

630
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,519
stems are really being agitated

631
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,359
um they're either going through some

632
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,879
mechanical de-stemming

633
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,879
process and that that physical

634
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,720
breakage of that plant material i think

635
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,240
is releasing a lot of spores

636
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,319
and they sort of they're sort of like

637
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,839
think of the cloud effect those clouds

638
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,519
are sort of moving up into the air so

639
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,439
when we put those plates out

640
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,879
when the spores landed back down onto

641
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
the plates and we had them out for about

642
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,320
an hour

643
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,600
they were just covered in penicillium

644
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,480
spores so

645
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,480
you know we're finding flowers that are

646
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,480
that are dried hang dried

647
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,159
and are not agitated to the same extent

648
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
as as buds that are pushed through

649
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,000
mechanical

650
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,080
um de-stemmers and and trimmers

651
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,159
um those that mechanical agitation is

652
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,960
causing more spores to build up on

653
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,559
product

654
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,600
than if you actually hang hand-dried

655
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,119
those those those stems

656
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,240
yeah and i have to imagine that if

657
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,000
you're a um if you're an employee there

658
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,359
you're you're breathing all that in

659
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,279
unless you're unless you're wearing a

660
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,759
mask and i'm not sure if they are

661
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,319
um i would think that if you're not

662
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,839
that's

663
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,240
something that you definitely want to

664
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,240
consider

665
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,399
yeah and that's the first recommendation

666
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,798
we made is is let's get those workers to

667
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,000
wear

668
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,240
um uh you know either n95 type mask so

669
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,240
masks that would have respiratory

670
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,480
abilities to take those spores out so

671
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,919
that their lungs are not exposed to

672
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,319
and it's not just the spores it's the

673
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,038
dust as well

674
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,158
right yeah masks they're they're

675
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,240
becoming

676
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,080
more and more common so i i wouldn't be

677
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,200
surprised if

678
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,480
folks adopted that for sure

679
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,480
and another thing that stood out from

680
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,759
that presentation was um you

681
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,038
actually looked at whether um

682
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,200
certain mediums were actually

683
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,000
contaminated and you were finding that

684
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,038
um

685
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,079
some uh coco coir that you had had

686
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,119
looked at was

687
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,839
was coming in contaminated that was that

688
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,239
was surprising to see as well

689
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,839
yeah and so you know uh you know again

690
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,240
the coca-cola is nothing more than

691
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,359
a plant material mostly fibrous plant

692
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,960
material that's

693
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,119
that's you know taken out of the cocoa

694
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,440
husk and and dried and

695
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,119
in some cases it's it's it's sterilized

696
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,759
and then it's sort of packaged in

697
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,439
in large bulks and shipped over from

698
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,000
overseas countries so

699
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,159
there's always a chance that microbes

700
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
and mold and other things can be carried

701
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,360
over

702
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
nothing you know nothing in particular

703
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,000
other than the penicillium and the

704
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,000
aspergilluses and so

705
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,599
on but once you place that cocoa in a

706
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,359
moist environment so you're wetting it

707
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,639
up and you're adding fertilizer

708
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,879
and you're using it as a growing

709
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,120
substrate that allows the

710
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,120
the residual spores that are in there to

711
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,319
start with to all of a sudden start

712
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,918
multiplying

713
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,759
and so what we were seeing is that when

714
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,919
you had those coco substrates um

715
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,519
spores were were being produced that we

716
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,960
were catching on these petri dishes that

717
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,960
we were laying out

718
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,400
and the concern was similar to the

719
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,240
fiserium concern

720
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,159
is that once they get up into the air

721
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,919
they could then land on these flowers

722
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,919
that are maturing or getting ready to be

723
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,038
harvested and then you're picking up the

724
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,960
spores that

725
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,720
that were building up as a result of the

726
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,798
substrate that you were using to grow

727
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,240
the plants in

728
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:36,558
right and that's not to say that

729
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,599
you know all all microbes are bad right

730
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,599
so there are

731
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,879
certainly beneficial microbes that that

732
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,079
may be present in

733
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,520
sort of an organic uh medium like that

734
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:48,960
as well right yeah and and so we've

735
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,759
actually sampled recently a lot of

736
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,759
organic

737
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,079
substrates and and as you mentioned the

738
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,798
organic growers tend to use soil

739
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,439
and soil is good uh in the sense that it

740
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,000
has a

741
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,960
much better buffering capacity against

742
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,240
pathogens than

743
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,079
let's say hydroponics or rockwool so

744
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,000
the on the positive side we're seeing

745
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,399
less disease develop

746
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,679
in in roots and crowns of plants that

747
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,880
are grown in soil

748
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,679
because you've got so much of that

749
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,600
buffering capacity

750
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,320
but we're finding more microbes in the

751
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,319
air in an organic production system

752
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,319
again going back to this idea that

753
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,759
soil has a lot of beneficials and other

754
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,399
microbes in there

755
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,759
more of them are getting into the air

756
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,200
then you would find perhaps in a

757
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,519
hydroponic or or

758
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,240
a system that uses is used as rock wool

759
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,000
the the concern the irony here is that

760
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,000
even these beneficial microbes let's say

761
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,839
coming out of organic systems

762
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,599
if they do land on these flowers they

763
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,199
would be rated again as a general

764
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,879
quality forming unit

765
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,319
it may actually cause a lot of the

766
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,400
product to fail and

767
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,158
and you know as a general rule and this

768
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,840
is just sort of a broad statement

769
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,080
a lot of the organic organic growers are

770
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,158
having problems passing their product

771
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,319
more so than than the guys that are

772
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,000
using hydroponic or rockwool

773
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,158
because of that background level of

774
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,159
microbes some of which are beneficial

775
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,159
getting onto the flower and causing the

776
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,760
plant the product to be rejected because

777
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,559
we don't discriminate right now between

778
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,558
the good and the bad

779
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,559
right and that's something that we see

780
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,240
on our end too because obviously we're

781
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:21,839
we're involved in kind of testing the

782
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,720
end product to make sure it doesn't have

783
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,278
that that contamination um

784
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,919
and yeah we we see cultivators that are

785
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:29,599
using

786
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,440
you know trichoderma as you mentioned

787
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,558
earlier and other these other beneficial

788
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,159
microbes that

789
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,079
you know might be testing hot for some

790
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,600
of these total count tests so

791
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,119
um i think it's great the work that

792
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,798
you're doing and others are doing to

793
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,879
sort of identify

794
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,839
what are these harmful pathogens that

795
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,240
are out there and

796
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,399
we can develop some species specific

797
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,200
type testing to make sure that

798
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,080
it's clean of that and sort of let the

799
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,440
beneficial stuff

800
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:59,038
go through obviously within reason

801
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,038
um yeah

802
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
yeah and i think the problem is it adds

803
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,399
an extra burden

804
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
on the on the companies that are testing

805
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
um because it's so much easier to just

806
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,400
say oh yeah ten to the four or ten to

807
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,000
the three

808
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
conforming units when you have to start

809
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,839
distinguishing between them

810
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,599
uh you need the pcr based type assays

811
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,038
that you guys are developing to say

812
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,879
okay it's a trichoderma or it's a

813
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:21,759
penicillium or it's an aspergillus or

814
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,200
it's something

815
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,919
in between and i think that's going to

816
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,919
be really important

817
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:32,558
and so i imagine that sort of the the

818
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,240
goal would be eventually to maybe

819
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,079
breed some varieties that have

820
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,399
resistance to some of these pathogens

821
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,759
whether it be fusarium or powdery mildew

822
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,879
or things like that

823
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,038
and in general how long does it take to

824
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,960
to sort of do that first of all and then

825
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,038
second do we even really have a full

826
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,319
picture of all the pathogens that can

827
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:55,200
potentially infect the plant

828
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:58,079
yeah so um with cannabis i think

829
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,399
breeding for resistance is quite doable

830
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,278
and a couple of reasons for that firstly

831
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,558
there's so much

832
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,480
genetic diversity that i think it's not

833
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,720
so much can we can we find it

834
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,079
it's how are we going to find it i think

835
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,519
the first step is going to be developing

836
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,199
methods for screening

837
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,398
so whether you're screening for fusarium

838
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,759
or if you're screening for powdery

839
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:17,199
mildew resistance

840
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,359
we have to have some really good methods

841
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,038
developed that are actually

842
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,879
already developed in other crops so you

843
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,440
know in tomato again and

844
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,278
in cotton or basil they've already

845
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,278
developed methods for screening for

846
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,200
fusion and powdery mildew resistance so

847
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,759
we need to adapt those methods for

848
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,640
for cannabis and then go out and do a

849
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,319
major collection

850
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,480
and maybe collect about 100 of these

851
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,639
different strains or genotypes

852
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,159
and then run these these methods through

853
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,880
and try to identify

854
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,799
um let's say five or ten that show some

855
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,399
level of resistance to either fusarium

856
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,079
or poverty mildew

857
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:51,918
and then i think it's a matter of making

858
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,240
crosses so you induce

859
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,640
some male flowers collect the pollen you

860
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,599
know make the crosses like most breeders

861
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,919
most growers would collect that seed and

862
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,359
then

863
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,520
run the test again in the next

864
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,599
generation to find those plants that

865
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,759
that may have picked up the resistance

866
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,959
so i think you know after three or four

867
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:13,440
rounds of this testing we could identify

868
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,319
potentially certain strains of genotypes

869
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,320
that have resistance

870
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,399
yeah and then second part of that

871
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,440
question do we even really have

872
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,759
a full picture of the

873
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,240
full breath of pathogens that can affect

874
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,240
cannabis

875
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,880
yeah so you know i go out to i go out to

876
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,640
the license growers uh

877
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,880
about once a week usually i go out on

878
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,559
wednesday so that's my cannabis day

879
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,159
and yeah i'm not and it's i'm not

880
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,000
surprised where

881
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,679
uh we stumble across new diseases and

882
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,839
i'm not going to say there's like

883
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,880
hundreds of them i would say we're

884
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,240
probably found maybe 10 or 15

885
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,000
and that's not to say that that's the

886
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,839
maximum number of diseases were found

887
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,519
there's going to be more so you talk to

888
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,000
the hemp growers in the u.s they're

889
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,679
always finding new diseases there's

890
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,038
diseases coming from a different crop

891
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,720
there's diseases coming

892
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,398
from a different area there may be

893
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,519
diseases coming from

894
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:11,038
a wind storm or rainstorm that brings

895
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,720
you know spores in from nearby areas

896
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,319
at some point we are going to max out

897
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,079
we'll probably have a full list of

898
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,599
diseases that are out there

899
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,158
but you know i think we've got the major

900
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:23,599
ones the major ones being powdery mildew

901
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,679
botrytis fusarium pythium

902
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,359
a number of leaf spotting diseases that

903
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,038
are found back east

904
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,879
and then of course a couple of virus

905
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,679
diseases that we haven't quite um

906
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,960
worked on yet so i think we're the list

907
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,080
is getting closer to being

908
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,840
completed at least i hope it is

909
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,678
yeah add it to the list of things in the

910
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,720
cannabis industry that we don't quite

911
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,720
have figured out yet

912
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,000
um yeah and i did want to shift gears a

913
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,398
little bit because

914
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,519
i know that um your presentation at this

915
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,678
year's canmed

916
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,960
um isn't actually about plant pathogens

917
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,240
it's actually about um

918
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,000
the development of cannabis trichomes

919
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,440
um so i want to give you an opportunity

920
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,119
to talk a bit about that

921
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,440
and give us a little bit of a preview of

922
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:09,518
what that's going to be about

923
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,880
okay i i'm sorry this this didn't work

924
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,599
out for you guys this year to have the

925
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,320
conference in

926
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,158
in pasadena but um hopefully next year

927
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,720
when kovid gets a little bit

928
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,159
easier to deal with yeah i was going to

929
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
talk about some of the work we've done

930
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,519
with

931
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,640
with trichome development and trichome

932
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,798
analysis

933
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,759
so what we've done is is you know

934
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,200
there's a standard

935
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,038
large piece of equipment called a

936
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,480
scanning electron microscope

937
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,640
and what that allows you to do is

938
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,480
actually magnify

939
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,480
the bracts and the other tissues

940
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,399
surrounding a cannabis flower

941
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,919
where you can you can magnify let's say

942
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,359
ten thousand times

943
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,360
and really get in there and start

944
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,558
looking at these these uh developing

945
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,398
trichomes

946
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,678
and we've found well we found two or

947
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:53,359
three really interesting things

948
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,440
um the first would be that we found four

949
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,558
uh different trichome types and maybe

950
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,038
i'll come back to that in a minute

951
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,359
there's

952
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,960
there's at least four different types

953
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,278
the ones that we're all familiar with of

954
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,200
course

955
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,480
are the stocked glandular trichomes

956
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,679
those are the ones that

957
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,599
that produce most of the cannabinoids

958
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,759
so we found the different types we also

959
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,558
found that there appears to be

960
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,079
changes in numbers in those four as the

961
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,839
plant matures

962
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,079
and so again as you probably would

963
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,319
expect more of the glandular

964
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,000
stock trichomes are are being seen as

965
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,678
the flowers tend to mature

966
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,599
because the other ones they're the sort

967
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,159
of the horsepower behind

968
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,879
producing all the cannabinoids and then

969
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,919
the other thing we

970
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,039
we did see is some differences between

971
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,880
varieties or between genotypes and so

972
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,398
the excitement there is that if you

973
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,320
could correlate

974
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,000
those different trichome types or

975
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,278
different trichome numbers

976
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,398
to final thc cbd and other cannabinoid

977
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,079
ratios

978
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,079
then that would be a really powerful way

979
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,839
to say okay i'm going to use

980
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,359
well maybe not a scanning microscope but

981
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,678
i'm going to use a way

982
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,439
to magnify those those flowers and look

983
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,600
at them and see

984
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,519
how many trichome types do i have and

985
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,398
how many total numbers of trichomes do i

986
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,000
have

987
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:07,918
and is that going to be a way for me to

988
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,359
tell whether i've got 12

989
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,278
thc or 20 thc or not so that's sort of

990
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,519
where we're going with this study is

991
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,480
is trying to correlate what we're seeing

992
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,359
visually with

993
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,759
some biochemical analysis of those

994
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,759
flowers

995
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:25,678
so that's interesting is it possible

996
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,759
that the different

997
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,278
trichome types could actually be

998
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,398
producing different

999
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,440
cannabinoids so that's a really

1000
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,319
interesting question and

1001
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,278
and um so so let me just tell you sort

1002
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,599
of what those four

1003
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,440
types are the the first type is is sort

1004
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,119
of the hair like projections this the

1005
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,399
staccalits as we call them

1006
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,319
which really don't produce any

1007
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,839
cannabinoids at all they have a

1008
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,240
protective function they're the ones

1009
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,319
that you know these humongous hair-like

1010
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,079
structures that if i was an insect and i

1011
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,599
i stumbled into them it's going to be

1012
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,079
game over for me so

1013
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,278
those definitely have a protective role

1014
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,278
and then as i mentioned

1015
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,480
the stock glandular trichomes the ones

1016
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:03,679
that produce most of the the

1017
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,200
cannabinoids

1018
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,440
and then there's a there's a shorter

1019
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,838
form of those uh which are the

1020
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,918
what we call the sessile glandular and

1021
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,480
the sessile are pretty much

1022
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,199
um the same as the the the glandular

1023
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,119
except

1024
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,559
they have way lower levels of

1025
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,519
cannabinoids in other words they're

1026
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,799
they're immature form of the the stock

1027
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,398
glandular

1028
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,720
uh so that's that's sort of the second

1029
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,519
type uh the third type is

1030
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,638
what we call bulbas and the bulbas are

1031
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,639
tiny

1032
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,838
they're so small that that you could

1033
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,838
never see them with even with a

1034
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,159
magnifying glass you really have to have

1035
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,000
a high power microscope to see those and

1036
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,440
so i don't know what those are doing

1037
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,119
in terms of their function are they

1038
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,639
producing cannabinoids are they

1039
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,639
producing terpenes maybe i don't know

1040
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,919
and then the fourth type is what we call

1041
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,559
the peltate

1042
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,000
and those are um sort of like half moon

1043
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,878
shaped in the microscope they're half

1044
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,039
moon shaped

1045
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,039
they're like saucers upside down saucers

1046
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,679
sitting on the surface of a leaf

1047
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,039
they don't have a stalk they're pretty

1048
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,480
large you can see them

1049
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,239
and again i don't know what the function

1050
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,280
of those are it may be terpenes and

1051
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,279
maybe cannabinoids

1052
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,000
that's really interesting um and then i

1053
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,199
thought reading through the abstract it

1054
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,079
looked like you had looked at two

1055
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,118
different types

1056
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,640
or two different cultivars

1057
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,320
is it possible that if you were to

1058
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:25,679
survey more you might even find

1059
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,680
other types of trichomes

1060
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,720
yeah it's possible so we picked those

1061
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,639
two because they differed quite a bit in

1062
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,919
the in the thc content so one was like

1063
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,559
10 percent and

1064
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,760
and the other was like around 18. uh and

1065
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,279
and i think we saw

1066
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,720
that in the 18 percent the higher thc

1067
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,119
cbd type strains they were

1068
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,799
larger numbers of trichomes and the

1069
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,720
stalks from those trichomes were

1070
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,839
much longer in other words they they

1071
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,358
were the type of

1072
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,358
strain that you looked at with that with

1073
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,440
a hand lens and you you could see the

1074
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:58,799
trichomes really clearly

1075
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,960
and you could differentiate whether or

1076
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,920
not they were so the milky type or

1077
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,960
whether they were the

1078
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,880
sort of the amber colored uh type so

1079
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,880
at least for those trichomes we think

1080
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,519
there's a correlation between the

1081
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,599
final thc content and trichome numbers

1082
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,440
excellent well i look forward to seeing

1083
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,160
those pictures if they're anything like

1084
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,159
the

1085
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,759
the photos that you presented at kmid

1086
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,559
2018 with the

1087
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,520
the close-up of powdery mildew and

1088
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,519
things like that and

1089
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,599
infecting the plant that's it's pretty

1090
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,800
amazing stuff to look at i i encourage

1091
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,519
anyone to

1092
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,640
go back and view the video of um of

1093
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,199
zamir's

1094
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,838
presentation at 2018 because it was uh

1095
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,679
it was certainly a hit

1096
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,838
yeah i i tell you ben these these

1097
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,559
pictures are are way better i mean i i

1098
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,400
was

1099
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,078
i'm really really excited next year to

1100
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,599
try to present those because i

1101
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,320
i look at them every once in a while and

1102
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,240
i i think i'm like i'm i'm in outer

1103
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,160
space i'm sitting on the moon somewhere

1104
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,679
and these huge projectiles because

1105
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,639
they're massive in the microscope

1106
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,838
they're scanning

1107
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:05,039
they're huge and they're amazing they're

1108
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,039
just an amazing sight

1109
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,720
well i'm looking forward to it i think

1110
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,839
it's a good

1111
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,838
i think that's a great place to stop um

1112
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,519
thanks again zamir for for taking the
