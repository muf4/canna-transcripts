at kmed 2022 dale participated in a

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,560
panel discussion titled the impacts of

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,640
legalization on the cannabis legacy and

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,199
the need for solutions to create a

79
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,598
healthier industry where he provided his

80
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,079
expertise with regards to how legacy

81
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,399
breeders can protect their ip

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,080
during our discussion we cover the

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,799
different types of patents that can be

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,840
used to protect cannabis and hemp plants

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,000
what plant patents cover as well as

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,158
specific exemptions

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
how plant patents can be challenged or

88
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,399
invalidated

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,560
the panic then ensued after the biotech

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,680
institute began patenting cannabis

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,878
plants in 2017 and how it affected the

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
industry

93
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,719
the biggest hurdles that prevent

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,640
breeders from protecting their plants

95
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,799
and how breeders can determine which

96
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,479
plants are worth patenting

97
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640

really any aspect of the cannabis

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,199
industry from genetics to manufacturing

129
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,038
processes to the final product so could

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,439
you explain which part of the industry

131
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,120
you specialize in and why you chose that

132
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,360
to be your focus

133
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,079
yeah thanks uh that's that's really fun

134
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
to talk about so um i came to

135
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,758
intellectual property as a plant

136
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,280
scientist i studied botany and plant

137
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,520
genetics and molecular and cellular

138
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,638
biology before i went to law school

139
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,478
and

140
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,918
in my career as a big law firm attorney

141
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,199
i had an opportunity to work on all

142
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,680
kinds of patents biotech clean energy

143
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,360
sustainable technologies medicine

144
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,560
all kinds of things and i still do to

145
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,520
some extent but as the cannabis industry

146
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,680
really emerged and

147
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,359
people started realizing that patents

148
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,759
were obtainable for

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
cannabis genetics that really seemed to

150
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,000
be a sweet spot for me

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,919
i gave a few talks and a few breeders i

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,918
guess found out that this is what i do

153
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,279
and they came to me and asked me if i

154
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,519
could help them protect their cannabis

155
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,599
genetics and that has become

156
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,079
a really large part more than half of my

157
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,479
practice so it's um it's it's very

158
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,639
exciting to see the growth um

159
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,038
uh the industry has its ups and downs

160
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,759
like all industries do but it's um it's

161
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,519
fun to participate in it

162
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,360
excellent now

163
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,159
can you explain the different types of

164
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,759
patents that can be applied to protect a

165
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,639
breeder's ip

166
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,720
yes

167
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,478
um

168
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,840
let's we can talk about patents and then

169
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,199
we'll i'll talk about a patent

170
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,638
equivalent so i hope i don't forget to

171
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,478
talk about that because that's a very

172
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,639
important thing in the us and and abroad

173
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,560
first starting to it in talking about

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,079
patents the the one that people always

175
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,759
think of is something called a plant

176
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,758
patent and plant patents are really for

177
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
any kind of plant that is asexually

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,680
propagated so in in cannabis we refer to

179
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,839
that as cloning but you know if you

180
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
think about grapevines and cherry trees

181
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,318
and all those kinds of things those are

182
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,918
all asexually propagated organisms and

183
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,199
the plant patent statute was really

184
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,000
created to

185
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,038
fill a gap in the kind of available

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
coverage

187
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,399
for

188
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,000
creative work when

189
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,758
the plant breeding industry as an

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,839
industry really started to take off and

191
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,038
that was back in the 1930s

192
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,799
so

193
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,560
one of the options with cannabis is to

194
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,759
get a plant patent

195
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,839
the interesting thing about plant

196
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,598
patents is they are only infringed by

197
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,279
asexual propagation

198
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,519
so let's suppose you've got a strain

199
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,359
that or a cultivar there's some

200
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,120
difference of opinion about the the best

201
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,520
term to use

202
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,560
i am pretty agnostic about that because

203
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,639
i think it's more about just

204
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,399
communicating with where people are but

205
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
let's suppose you've got a cultivar that

206
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,159
um

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
that is so

208
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,319
that this not easy to breed with and not

209
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,680
very stable but it's really special in

210
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,598
its clinical form

211
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,319
and so the real value is all about

212
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,598
clonal propagation and that's really all

213
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,680
the only thing anybody would ever want

214
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,159
to do with that plant in that case a

215
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
plant patent would fit because

216
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,360
it

217
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,959
it would provide the adequate coverage

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,560
to for something that's only really

219
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,159
clonally propagated

220
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,280
the thing that's interesting about the

221
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
cannabis

222
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,878
plant though is as you know it can be

223
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,560
propagated

224
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,278
on in scale

225
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,719
either clonally or by seeds and one of

226
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,519
the things people might want to do with

227
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,959
a special cultivar is use it to breed

228
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,399
some other things

229
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,158
and what's important about a plant

230
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,480
patent is it's not infringed by breeding

231
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,120
and it's not infringed by making seeds

232
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,680
and so if you've got something that that

233
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,919
has value for breeding or for for

234
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,759
producing seeds a plant patent really

235
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,399
wouldn't be enough and then you'd have

236
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,958
to

237
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,039
pursue a utility patent

238
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,879
and utility patent is the kind of the

239
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,000
common kind of patent that people use on

240
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,399
jet engines and and telecommunication

241
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,320
devices and pharmaceuticals

242
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,559
but there's a way to make a utility

243
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,920
patent really fit a plant variety and

244
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,838
make it not as

245
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,240
complicated or difficult to obtain as a

246
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,680
typical utility patent and that is by

247
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,080
defining

248
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,919
the claims to finding the invention with

249
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,080
reference to a specific biological

250
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,799
deposit they say this is our example of

251
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,160
this organism it's on deposit we're not

252
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,838
trying to get anything that's broader

253
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,600
than this organism or that's different

254
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,720
let's say different from this organism

255
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,720
but we are trying to get some breadth

256
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
around it so we want to we're going to

257
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,040
make this deposit and then we're going

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,679
to say

259
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:43,439
we claim seeds that correspond to seeds

260
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:45,759
on this on deposit we also claim using

261
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,680
plants grown from these seeds or progeny

262
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,838
of those plants grown from these seeds

263
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,399
for breeding or for

264
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,920
making products etc so you can get a lot

265
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,080
broader protection than from a plant

266
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,079
patent so why would anybody ever choose

267
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,639
a plant patent well it's faster and it's

268
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,720
cheaper than a utility patent but of the

269
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,039
utility patent that involves making a

270
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,959
deposit which in my firm we refer to

271
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,879
that as a variety specific utility

272
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,039
patent

273
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,958
those cost about twice as much as a

274
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,838
plant patent and take a little longer

275
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,799
usually to get but they are it's it's

276
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,480
still

277
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,639
very consistently predictable that you

278
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,560
can obtain those you're not going to run

279
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,078
into a whole lot of barriers if you

280
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,599
really did breed that and if it really

281
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,000
is new and distinguishable from other

282
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,959
things that are out there

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,679
excellent

284
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,000
so

285
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,278
back to the plant patent and it's it's

286
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,519
interesting that that asexual

287
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,480
propagation is such an important piece

288
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,639
so

289
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,800
here's a hypothetical so say i i

290
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,078
purchase a patented cultivar yes and i

291
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,159
self it

292
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,319
and you know create feminized seeds and

293
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,278
then from that i do my own final hunt

294
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,839
and then

295
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,278
um find a cultivar that's actually

296
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,920
pretty similar to the first one that i

297
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,399
purchased am i in the clear there

298
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,439
if it's only protected by a plant patent

299
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,240
and so how do you know well you call me

300
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
or

301
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,039
you can look it up if you if if it's

302
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,639
marked with with a patent notice which

303
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,039
patented goods are supposed to be marked

304
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,559
with then it will have a patent number

305
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,799
and it will either be

306
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:18,719
a um let's see uh an eight-digit number

307
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,879
um so it would look like something yeah

308
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,480
it would look like 10 comma you know

309
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,958
three digits three digits that would be

310
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,600
a utility patent if it has a number that

311
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,439
starts with two p's it's p p and then

312
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,320
usually five digits that's a plant

313
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
pattern

314
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,040
um and if so if it really is just a

315
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,039
plant patent and what you're doing is

316
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,799
you're breeding with it and then you're

317
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,480
doing a phenol hunt those things those

318
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,519
activities would not infringe a plant

319
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,600
patent and that's why even though

320
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,679
it's rare that we recommend plant

321
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,360
patents even though i've done tons of

322
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,719
plant patents in other with fruits and

323
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,079
flowers

324
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,800
it's rare that that's adequate

325
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,879
protection for really special cultivar

326
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,559
but like i say sometimes a cultivar

327
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,720
isn't very stable you're never going to

328
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,719
make good seeds from it it's not easy to

329
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,639
breed with for whatever reason but you

330
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,000
just really love that exact clonal form

331
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,839
and that in which case plant patent

332
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,919
would be a perfect fit

333
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,959
excellent and now you did mention patent

334
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,559
equivalence and you didn't want to

335
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,239
forget to talk about that too yes thank

336
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,759
you for remembering i saw you taking

337
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
notes there

338
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,000
in addition the u.s is really unusual in

339
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,559
having three different ways of

340
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,839
protecting a plant cultivar you can

341
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,679
certainly as we've discussed you can

342
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,600
protect it with a plant patent you can

343
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,078
protect it with a utility patent that

344
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,278
involves a deposit you can also protect

345
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,439
it with something provided through the

346
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:36,240
usda called the plant variety protection

347
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,839
certificate and so that's it's a form of

348
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,519
intellectual property and it has a

349
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,279
similar scope of

350
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,120
it's an exclusionary right meaning when

351
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,078
you have the right to or when you have

352
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,519
that that grant of intellectual property

353
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,719
it gives you the right to make other

354
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,240
people

355
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,839
stop doing something in court or stop

356
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,879
and go to court to make them stop doing

357
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,399
something or it gives you a right to

358
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,480
authorize them with a license and

359
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,799
correct and collect royalties but a

360
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,039
plant variety protection certificate is

361
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,479
um it's it's a it's different from a

362
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,399
patent

363
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,480
it is part of an international

364
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,519
convention called upof it's the us

365
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,278
implementation of upof and upon was

366
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,120
created really as a patent alternative

367
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,200
because a lot of countries don't want to

368
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
have living organisms within their

369
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,399
patentable subject matter scope they

370
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,919
don't they don't there are their patent

371
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,440
offices don't like working with living

372
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,278
organisms or have some other public

373
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,200
policy reason not to

374
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,958
but recognizing the

375
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,759
tremendous importance of plant breeding

376
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,199
and plant varieties throughout the world

377
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,600
there was this international convention

378
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,959
created that established its own form of

379
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,680
intellectual property protection for

380
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,759
plant varieties and so

381
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,879
there are about 75 countries that are

382
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,360
members of upof including the u.s but so

383
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,879
when the u.s joined upof we did it by

384
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,278
plastic passing the plant variety

385
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,360
protection act and making the usda the

386
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,120
administrator of that the administrative

387
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
agency for that

388
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,078
act so

389
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,240
what are the differences the main

390
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:06,239
difference is that well there are a few

391
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,278
differences for one right now at least

392
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:14,000
the since the usda requires a seed

393
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,958
deposit for a pvp application

394
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,320
the only

395
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,759
and they receive the seed deposit

396
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,639
themselves or some

397
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,958
government agency proxy does uh they

398
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,198
will only accept applications that

399
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,559
qualify under federal under the farm

400
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,679
bill as him

401
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,719
so it's got to be 0.3 thc or less than

402
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,039
the flower um if it's more than that and

403
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,040
you have to describe things like you

404
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,679
know the thc levels in the flower as

405
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,120
part of the overall disclosure so and if

406
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,120
it if it doesn't qualify as hemp they

407
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,399
won't accept the seed deposit and so

408
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,078
they don't have

409
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,839
a real per se ban on accepting marijuana

410
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,838
applications or considering marijuana

411
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,880
applications there's just no mechanism

412
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,000
to handle the seed deposit requirement

413
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,600
so

414
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,120
we we believe that this this will change

415
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,680
it changed really fast when the farm

416
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,039
bill was passed the usda very quickly

417
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,519
adopted it started accepting

418
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,799
applications for hemp genetics and we

419
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,480
believe that they'll do the very same

420
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,559
thing for marijuana as soon as that is

421
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
federally legal but and and then the

422
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,479
other important thing about pvp

423
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,120
protection is that it has a couple of

424
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,920
kind of public policy carve-outs it is

425
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,399
not an infringement of a pvp certificate

426
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,399
for someone to breed with that variety

427
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,320
it's it's in it's built into the statute

428
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
that that's okay to do

429
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,360
um so again if you want to if you want

430
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,800
to have breeding be prohibited you've by

431
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,079
with your intellectual property rights

432
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,078
you've got to do that with the utility

433
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,039
patent because the pvp certificate and

434
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,399
the plant

435
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,240
patent will not

436
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
that will not prevent breeding and then

437
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,519
the other carve out the other kind of

438
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,440
public policy right is that someone who

439
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,720
obtains legitimately

440
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,120
seeds of a of a pvp protected variety

441
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,360
has a right to bulk out the to make the

442
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,919
same number of seeds for the next uh the

443
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,560
next planting that's called the farmer's

444
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,078
exemption and so you buy the seeds once

445
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,518
but then you can make your own seeds

446
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,278
after that now you can't make them to

447
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,360
sell to third parties but you can make

448
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,480
them to replant the same area the same

449
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,199
acreage

450
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
so

451
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,719
you know

452
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,159
there are scenarios under which a pvp

453
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,278
certificate would make a lot of sense

454
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,120
and would be the right thing but first

455
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,120
of all it's got to be hemp secondly

456
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,679
you've got to be you've got to recognize

457
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,240
the farmer's exemption and the reader's

458
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,000
exemption and be okay with those now the

459
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,639
one other little nuance to that which is

460
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,399
that in the u.s and i think in most upof

461
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,198
countries if you don't like those

462
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,879
exemptions you can only license you can

463
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,120
just have a policy that well we don't

464
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,439
license this to anyone and we don't give

465
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,159
access to these seeds to anyone who

466
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,160
isn't willing to sign an agreement that

467
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,399
they will not breed or that they will

468
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,958
not re they'll buy new seed from us

469
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,039
every season and so

470
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,799
in most countries it's okay to contract

471
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,078
out of those exemptions

472
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,758
and to fill those gaps with a contract

473
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,198
but some countries are so committed to

474
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,199
that as a matter of public policy that

475
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,879
they won't they'll say any contract that

476
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,159
attempts to take away these exemptions

477
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280
is invalid

478
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,120
so

479
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,798
that's country by country and it changes

480
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,879
sometimes so

481
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,639
you'd want to get a lawyer that knows

482
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,240
this and works with it to check the

483
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,559
countries of interest and see if you can

484
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,599
contract out of that but that's some

485
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,038
that's that's the ip well it's an ip

486
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,798
it's a form of intellectual property

487
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,119
it's a patent equivalent but not really

488
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,558
a patent and really plant variety

489
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,558
protection throughout all the rest of

490
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,879
the world is done through up rather than

491
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,960
through patent offices with a couple of

492
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,679
really minor exceptions

493
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,558
great and so which type of

494
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,480
uh ip protection do you think is or do

495
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,480
you see as the most commonly used to

496
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,400
protect cannabis cultivars

497
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,880
well you know what's interesting is

498
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,559
if you watched the patent issuances over

499
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,039
the last few years you saw a lot of

500
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,639
plant patents issuing um and i think

501
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,279
it's for two reasons one is they do

502
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,960
issue faster than other patents

503
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,639
um they're cheaper and so people who

504
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,480
just want to have a patent for you know

505
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,960
portfolio building purposes or bragging

506
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,960
rights or something might choose one

507
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,798
like that

508
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,880
and i think also a lot of people didn't

509
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,639
realize the weaknesses of a plant patent

510
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,679
and how plant patent doesn't work very

511
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,200
well for

512
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,798
well doesn't provide really full

513
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,279
coverage for a plant-like cannabis that

514
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,279
can be propagated both ways

515
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,678
so i think it was a combination of all

516
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,839
those reasons you you are seeing more of

517
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,840
these variety specific utility patents

518
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,798
um issuing now

519
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,839
we've got a lot more than i could count

520
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,679
off the top of my head we've got a lot

521
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,359
that are pending we have a few plant

522
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,759
patents that are pending and somebody

523
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,759
who has

524
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,000
for whom protection

525
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,080
quick and thorough protection is a

526
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,919
higher priority than saving money they

527
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,839
can they can certainly pursue both and

528
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,520
so you could start with a plant patent

529
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,159
get that issued quickly

530
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,519
have your clonal propagation protected

531
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,679
and then follow it um with it with a

532
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,200
vsup a variety specific utility patent

533
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,600
that ties back to the plant patent

534
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,519
filing and then you can have both kinds

535
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,599
of coverage but now you're paying you

536
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,440
know something like 3x the cost of the

537
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,159
plant patent instead of

538
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
one of the other 1x or 2x if that makes

539
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,558
sense

540
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,558
yeah yeah yeah

541
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,000
no and then you sort of mentioned

542
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,678
monitoring the different patents that

543
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,839
have issued over the years and you know

544
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,640
it's funny about five years ago

545
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:25,038
when groups like biotech institute began

546
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,960
registering patents on cannabis plants

547
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,558
there was a lot of panic in the industry

548
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,000
from people who thought that

549
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,440
you know they would maybe be sued for

550
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,919
growing weed in their own backyard so

551
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,320
what has become of those early patents

552
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,120
and have they been enforced or had any

553
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,720
real impact on the industry

554
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,319
i think they've had a big impact on the

555
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,279
industry but maybe not the intended

556
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,159
impact

557
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,599
so

558
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,200
the whole way i got into the industry i

559
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,519
was minding my business in my office in

560
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,279
san francisco and i got an email from

561
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,038
somebody who was organizing something

562
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,519
called the open cannabis project and

563
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,359
they were all in a flutter over those

564
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,879
biotech institute patents they thought

565
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,319
this is the beginning of the end of this

566
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,679
emerging industry it's going to be

567
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,678
dominated by

568
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,360
overbroad patents and it's going to put

569
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,200
a chilling effect on every all the home

570
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,399
growers and all the home breeders and

571
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,919
people are going to freak out and they

572
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,880
did kind of freak out

573
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,640
um

574
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
so they called me because they said well

575
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,400
we not we want somebody who really knows

576
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,400
plant ip we found you and would you be

577
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,559
willing to to

578
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,880
advise us and so that's actually how i

579
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,918
got into the cannabis industry in the

580
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,080
first place

581
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,000
um and so you know

582
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,158
i'm glad that happened it's been a it's

583
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,880
been a really interesting um

584
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,799
uh evolution step in my in my career

585
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,120
personally but

586
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,519
i think everybody did did believe that

587
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,399
there would be this really overbearing

588
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,599
um

589
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,159
oppressive

590
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,639
uh approach to patenting and patent

591
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,400
enforcement in the industry and there

592
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,720
are a few things that i think limit that

593
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
practically practically or or perhaps

594
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,480
legally and i'll try to go into all that

595
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,440
but before i forget when i started when

596
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,960
i got in involved in this and became so

597
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,320
involved in the industry and going to

598
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,720
meetings and talking to people and

599
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,558
giving talks and things i realized that

600
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,720
there were a lot of questions and not as

601
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,359
many answers and so i started a blog

602
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,440
called it's at plantlaw.com

603
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,319
it answers a lot of the really common

604
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,000
questions in fact one of the posts i i

605
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,798
is titled because it was a question i

606
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,279
got a million times at uh at a meeting

607
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,279
was can monsanto make me stop growing

608
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,038
monsanto or anybody else make me stop

609
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,480
growing my own plants

610
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,879
and um so i had i i started answering

611
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,200
these questions in the blog i don't blog

612
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,400
as much anymore i need to get back to it

613
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,000
but i'd say um the posts that are there

614
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,840
answer a lot of the most common

615
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,240
questions but yeah there was so much

616
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,678
anxiety about that so what has happened

617
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,599
since then and why

618
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,798
did it not go the way the people who

619
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,798
spent

620
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,200
tons of money on those patents maybe

621
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,400
thought it would um and i i'm not i

622
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
can't read their mind i don't know what

623
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,679
their motive was but

624
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,720
these early patents just to give some

625
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,360
context for people who haven't seen them

626
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,480
made the attempt to protect um to to

627
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,279
carve out some nip position not based

628
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,159
upon a specific genetics

629
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,119
like

630
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,440
seeds on deposit or like one cultivar

631
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,918
and its clonal progeny but it defined

632
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,679
the patent scope the patent right more

633
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,360
in terms of a chemotype

634
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,559
so it was really any cannabis plant that

635
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,519
has that checks these boxes you know a

636
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:32,000
certain

637
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:34,558
thc to cbd ratio a certain uh

638
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,798
ter really general terpene profile that

639
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,720
really would cover a lot of things

640
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,240
so why did that patent ever get allowed

641
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,200
well the way a patent examination

642
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,558
process works is the examiner

643
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,558
they're supposed to find reasons to

644
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,918
reject a patent claim

645
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,480
but how do they find their reasons they

646
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,320
do a search of the literature and so

647
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,919
they look at prior patents

648
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,558
and they look at prior academic

649
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
publications and anything they can get

650
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,399
from say

651
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,240
um

652
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,240
you know from the internet trade trade

653
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,038
journals or anything else

654
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,519
so

655
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,119
what's what is unique absolutely unique

656
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,720
about the cannabis industry in

657
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,199
comparison with other

658
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,038
high value industries is that

659
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
um there was a lot of prior commercial

660
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,119
activity and a lot of prior inventive

661
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,798
activity but it was the opposite of

662
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,678
published it was hidden

663
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,440
and so if an examiner needs to find a

664
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,798
way to reject a patent claim that is

665
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,558
very broad

666
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,639
he or she has to go look at prior

667
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,279
patents and there weren't a lot

668
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,960
prior academic publications not a lot

669
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,480
prior commercial activity or evidence of

670
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,279
prior commercial activity which was all

671
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,839
hidden

672
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,918
and so the examiner may have had may

673
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,558
have done a great job examining this but

674
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,240
did not have the tools to reject it so

675
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,399
of course now that the community sees

676
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,319
these claims and say hey that that's

677
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,640
jamaican lion and jamaican lion's been

678
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,879
around for a lot longer than this patent

679
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,559
than when this patent was filed and the

680
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,080
the community takes starts to take its

681
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,480
collective memory

682
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,639
and creates another kind of what you

683
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,519
could call prior art and that that's the

684
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
term that

685
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,960
they use for those things that the

686
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,960
examiner finds in a search

687
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,000
you could say this is prior art it's

688
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,400
just not

689
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,159
published prior art but it is something

690
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,000
that factually is out there and that

691
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,360
people could verify this is at least the

692
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
line of reasoning i haven't

693
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,399
independently verified this stuff but um

694
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,880
so they say all right in our community

695
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,240
collective memory or in the the evidence

696
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,278
that individual people could bring

697
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,200
forward

698
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,440
this chemotype existed a long time

699
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,360
before this patent was filed and so what

700
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,960
does that do well it explains why the

701
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,959
patent was at grant in the first place

702
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,319
the examiner didn't know as much as was

703
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,840
actually out there

704
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,599
they're not omniscient and they can only

705
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,439
do what they can do with searching so

706
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,000
that the the thing that would have

707
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,159
killed that patent application perhaps

708
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,359
was uh something that was factual but

709
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,520
not not knowable by an examiner but once

710
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,278
you start enforcing a patent you know

711
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,038
you you take you you

712
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,400
identify a defendant and you sue them

713
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,359
and you tell them you've got to either

714
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,120
pay me some money or stop using

715
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,359
my patented

716
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,479
technology or both

717
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,879
that's when

718
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,360
that's when it gets real right and um

719
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,120
and somebody's highly motivated to dig

720
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,439
deeper

721
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,639
and dig deeper than an examiner had time

722
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,240
to do

723
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,480
and use more resources now of course

724
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,159
that process is tremendously expensive

725
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,278
so one of the things i was advocating

726
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,520
early on

727
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,519
um in my blogging was to form some kind

728
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,119
of a community coalition that would a

729
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,038
little bit like nato or something we'd

730
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,558
all stan we'd all agree to defend

731
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,119
whoever is the one that gets uh that

732
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,798
gets poked by this first and we you know

733
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,879
we'd pull our resources and pull our

734
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,038
community knowledge to

735
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,799
overcome an overbought patent now what's

736
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,960
cool about this is

737
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,319
uh to my knowledge those patents have

738
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,159
never been asserted um they uh

739
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,839
they were maybe but they really

740
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,640
galvanized the community in a way that

741
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,038
i'm

742
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,360
i'm grateful for them and um and there

743
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,038
may be some real i'm not saying that the

744
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,959
patents don't have any value or don't

745
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,599
have any great business purpose they may

746
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,038
um that's that's um knowledge that i

747
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,599
don't have i don't have any inside

748
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,440
information on that company um and of

749
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,439
course that company is not the only one

750
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,038
there it's kind of a patent attorney's

751
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,159
job to try to get the broadest claims

752
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,038
they can

753
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,240
but when i'm counseling a client i i

754
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:17,919
tell them we want to get the broadest

755
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,278
valid claims you can get we don't want

756
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,799
you to have a patent that's not going to

757
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,798
be valid and so

758
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,639
just to close the loop on that when if

759
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,558
someone does assert a patent against me

760
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,320
and i do have evidence that the patent

761
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,639
never should have been granted one of my

762
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,278
defenses i might say yeah well i'm not

763
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,440
saying i don't that what i'm doing

764
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:37,440
doesn't fall within these claims which

765
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,720
would constitute infringement what i'm

766
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,120
saying is these claims never should have

767
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,919
been granted this is an invalid patent

768
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,719
and

769
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,720
my defense is not my own activities it's

770
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,839
that this pat the the patent office

771
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,200
didn't

772
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,959
granted a patent that never should have

773
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,600
been granted and and what's interesting

774
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,038
about that is if a patent is invalidated

775
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,719
in litigation

776
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,119
because the defendant can produce

777
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,159
evidence like that it's gone forever

778
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,558
yeah so you lose once and you and

779
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,240
on a validity challenge and and you're

780
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:07,759
done you know that and that assumes that

781
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,400
you've exhausted all of your appeals and

782
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,599
everything but uh so you know it's it

783
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,038
that might be another reason that these

784
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,639
patents haven't been asserted yet is

785
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,558
that there's a risk of having them um

786
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,480
exposed as being invalid

787
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,398
and i want to hasten to say i'm not

788
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,558
providing legal advice or legal analysis

789
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,558
on those patents but what i am doing is

790
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,038
talking about um

791
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,079
what the community has informed me of

792
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,000
and

793
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:35,519
combined with some general principles of

794
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,759
patent law so um no no legal advice or

795
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,398
opinions here but just a summary of

796
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:43,038
what's happened over the last few years

797
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,839
it's a good disclaimer

798
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,839
so

799
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,798
so you mentioned that you help breeders

800
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,759
sort of apply for and acquire patents on

801
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,519
their genetics do you ever represent

802
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:54,720
growers on the other side where maybe

803
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,839
there is

804
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,159
um

805
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,918
they are being sued for potentially

806
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,960
using patented

807
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,000
material and your as you described maybe

808
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,720
defending or invalidating that patent

809
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,278
yeah you know um what i do is something

810
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,038
that comes a little bit before that

811
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,119
patent litigation is so tremendously

812
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,200
expensive that there's a lot of

813
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,278
kind of paper shuffling and and foot

814
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,519
stomping and maybe saber rattling that

815
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,679
happens before a lawsuit is filed in in

816
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,119
many cases so somebody will get a letter

817
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,038
and they'll say and the letter will say

818
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,278
something like maybe you're not aware

819
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,440
but we have a patent that

820
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,880
that has this scope and you might be

821
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
operating within that patent and we'd

822
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,480
like you to take a look at that and

823
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,038
we're open to license discussions so and

824
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,919
that's that's a really gentle

825
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,319
kind of

826
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,759
uh nod towards a cease and desist letter

827
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,519
and the reason those are usually so

828
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,119
gentle is if you come on really strong

829
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,480
and say you're infringing our patent and

830
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,678
we're going to sue you

831
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,839
that can create something called

832
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,360
declaratory judgment jurisdiction which

833
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,918
will let the party that just got that

834
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,199
nasty letter sue you first and they'll

835
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,880
they could if they've got the money to

836
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,600
do this they can say oh we got this

837
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,520
letter we're taking you to court um for

838
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:06,000
a declaratory judgment that your patent

839
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,759
is invalid or that we don't infringe and

840
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,359
that shifts the balance of power so

841
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,038
there's there's some really good reason

842
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,079
not to write

843
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,839
overly aggressive overly explicit

844
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,519
initial letters like that so you usually

845
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,959
just try to

846
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,720
make someone aware that they've got a

847
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,360
risk without creating declaratory

848
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,600
judgment jurisdiction so when a client

849
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,199
gets a letter like that whether it's and

850
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,398
it's usually not about plant genetics

851
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,640
it's usually

852
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:32,479
about you know some manufacturing

853
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,840
technique or some composition or

854
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,880
something and i work with all of those

855
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,278
different subject matters in in cannabis

856
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,559
and across a lot of other industries

857
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,480
they get a letter like that and they

858
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:46,319
come to me and they say

859
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,278
um let's take a look at this and see

860
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,918
well

861
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,359
they say help me and then i say let's

862
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,200
take a look at that patent let's talk

863
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,119
about what you're actually doing let's

864
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,640
see let's interpret these patent claims

865
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:00,639
in view of not just what they say but in

866
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,559
view of the supporting

867
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,399
application that was filed and view the

868
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,398
arguments that they made to the patent

869
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,519
office to get to get it allowed in the

870
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,439
first place

871
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,759
and this whole analysis is called a

872
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,440
freedom to operate analysis and i do a

873
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,079
lot of that and i'm actually writing a

874
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,278
series of blog posts about fto that i'm

875
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:21,278
hoping to drop later this year so

876
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,640
when that happens you know the first

877
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,798
thing you do is you look at the patent

878
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,159
claims themselves and and you look at

879
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:27,759
and the claims are the part of the

880
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,000
patent that defines the legal right

881
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,359
defines the invention and you compare

882
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,599
that with what the

883
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,119
accused party is doing and if you can

884
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,398
find even one thing that that claim

885
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,319
requires

886
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,319
that your client or your you know

887
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,558
whoever is not doing

888
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,158
then that's that's what what you people

889
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,839
refer to that in a short hand called the

890
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,360
missing element rule

891
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,038
if there's something that the claim

892
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,439
requires that you're clearly not doing

893
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,879
then you just don't infringe and it's

894
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,880
not always black and white sometimes

895
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,519
it's pretty hard to figure that out but

896
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,679
and and let's say that right now

897
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,038
you do infringe every you you have every

898
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,559
one of the elements of that claim but

899
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,879
there's a design change that you could

900
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,038
make in one little feature that would

901
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,559
make it so that you there there's now a

902
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,319
missing element then you just you make a

903
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,119
design modification you write back and

904
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,119
say

905
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,359
uh you know our current uh our current

906
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,918
product doesn't seem to have everything

907
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,678
this patent requires so respectfully um

908
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,120
see you later uh

909
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,559
there and there's a lot of that and then

910
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,319
sometimes the client will just come to

911
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,480
me with knowing that one of their

912
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,918
competitors is doing a lot of patenting

913
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,519
and they'll say hey can we keep an eye

914
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,840
on these guys keep an eye on the claims

915
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,440
that they're issuing and

916
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:35,359
let's do a checkup every once in a while

917
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,960
and make sure that we're not stepping on

918
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,199
their toes so that we're not facing any

919
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,519
risks you know boards of directors and

920
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,278
inventor investors love it when you're

921
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,679
that careful as long as it's not too

922
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,398
expensive to be that careful so there's

923
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,240
there's a really good balance between

924
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,918
um you know kind of keeping your nose

925
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,359
clean as a company and making sure that

926
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,480
you're not infringing patents and that

927
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,879
you're aware of the ones that you need

928
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,440
to be watching out for um

929
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,200
and uh occasionally you know altering

930
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,200
your activities to redesigning your your

931
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,360
products or your methods

932
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,120
but to circle back to um the question

933
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,079
really about plant genetics

934
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,918
usually the because as i've as i've said

935
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,398
these kinds of patents like a plant

936
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,960
patent only infringed by actual cloning

937
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:19,439
of the exact same variety a variety

938
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,960
specific utility patent only infringed

939
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,720
by really starting with the same

940
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,640
genetics and doing something with it

941
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,558
that's within the scope of those claims

942
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,840
it's really rare to accidentally

943
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,519
infringe something like that and not

944
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,599
even know that you did maybe you

945
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,960
received something from someone else and

946
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,038
you're working with it and then you find

947
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,640
out late in the process that it was

948
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,240
covered by a patent and you didn't know

949
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,159
it and so maybe you did in good faith

950
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,240
infringe that well then smartest thing

951
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,240
to do is stop doing it and move on to

952
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,679
something else um

953
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,519
but uh it's it's really rare that these

954
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,440
things have to be litigated because if

955
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,000
someone isn't using the same genetics

956
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,440
it's pretty straightforward dna test and

957
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,319
you guys certainly know that those

958
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,840
things uh medicinal genomics um it's

959
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,359
pretty straightforward dna test to do a

960
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,359
comparison and say well you know these

961
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,278
might look superficially similar

962
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,119
phenotypically but they're not the same

963
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,440
genotypically they've got all these

964
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,038
differences and then anybody who who has

965
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,480
that pat would be crazy to continue to

966
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,200
pursue the case they'd just be throwing

967
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,278
money away down a hole because

968
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,840
the evidence would end up demonstrating

969
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,960
that it's not an infringement um on the

970
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:27,678
other hand if there is a a great match

971
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,880
either an identical match or a match

972
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,120
that shows that this these two this this

973
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,799
this accused plant definitely descended

974
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,199
from this this

975
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,079
patented plant then depending exactly on

976
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,240
on the scope of that patent right

977
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,759
it may be a clear infringement and the

978
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,359
reason these things don't get litigated

979
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,200
is because the evidence is usually so

980
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,119
clear one way or the other that there's

981
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,558
going to be a settlement way earlier in

982
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:54,798
the process without spending all the

983
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:56,158
money on discovery and a trial

984
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,079
excellent yeah no and you brought up

985
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,320
genotype which was great because i was

986
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,439
over genotyping i should say which is

987
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,200
great because i was going to ask you

988
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,558
about that now

989
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,278
i imagine that's probably not a

990
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,279
requirement for a patent application but

991
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,280
i imagine it's pretty valuable

992
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,679
especially if you're having a plant

993
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,599
patent and it's going to be asexually

994
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,079
propagated because then like you said

995
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,039
you would that is some great evidence to

996
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,639
show that it's exactly the same yeah the

997
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,639
what's interesting is the plant patent

998
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,480
statute says that you have to just you

999
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,639
have to disclose as much about the

1000
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,760
variety as you can

1001
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,760
um

1002
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,520
it doesn't require you to do a dna test

1003
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,359
i always tell people if you've got dna

1004
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:36,639
information even just a few markers or

1005
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:37,679
if you've got a whole genotype or

1006
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,000
whatever

1007
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,679
go for it let's include that but it's

1008
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,398
not required i've gotten

1009
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,398
lots and lots of plant patents and

1010
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,960
variety specific utility patents without

1011
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,878
submitting dna information but if you

1012
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,358
again if you've got it and a lot of

1013
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,199
things originate from it you know you do

1014
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,559
a dna test and you say oh this looks

1015
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,480
pretty interesting

1016
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,679
and then you end up deciding this might

1017
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,599
be interesting enough that i should

1018
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,039
patent it so and by then you've already

1019
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,119
got the dna information in your pocket

1020
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,000
you should include it in the application

1021
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,640
um

1022
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,719
but it's not required and so i always

1023
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,559
tell people look if you if you've got it

1024
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,879
use it if you're curious and you can

1025
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,838
afford the test go for it do it it's

1026
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,599
great information if you um

1027
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:20,960
don't have the dna test right now well

1028
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,400
you'll certainly want to get it if

1029
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,159
there's an infringement or if you're

1030
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
accused of infringing but the cool thing

1031
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,559
about dna is it doesn't really change if

1032
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,358
you've got a clonely propagated organism

1033
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,440
it's going to be there and you can use

1034
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:36,960
it when the evidence is you can go get

1035
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,358
the test when the evidence is needed

1036
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,358
excellent

1037
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,519
so what would you say are the most

1038
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,720
common hurdles

1039
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,960
preventing

1040
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,959
breeders or growers from protecting

1041
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,280
their ip

1042
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,920
i love that question um

1043
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,640
and one of the early blog posts i did

1044
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,880
was

1045
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,960
the question was how can i know if my

1046
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,079
plant is unique or different enough for

1047
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,199
patenting

1048
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,760
and the answer is if you've read it

1049
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,838
and selected it and you can identify how

1050
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,000
it's different from its parents

1051
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,559
it's already unique enough for patenting

1052
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,320
or new enough for patenting the that's

1053
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,679
really not the challenge the challenge

1054
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,800
is deciding which things are worth

1055
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:21,919
patenting you know if you commit to

1056
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,079
patenting um a cultivar

1057
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,720
you're going to be spending five figures

1058
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,280
um it's you're going to spend

1059
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:32,000
at least 10 to 15 to get a plant patent

1060
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,599
and you know probably 25 to 30 to get a

1061
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,199
variety specific utility pad and that

1062
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,359
can vary a little bit but it's not going

1063
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,960
to vary a lot um

1064
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,960
and so you're making a pretty big

1065
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,079
commitment there let's say that you've

1066
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,519
got something that's going to be the

1067
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,680
flavor of the month a couple years from

1068
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,519
now and then it'll fade away um not

1069
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:48,960
worth patenting probably

1070
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,880
on the other hand you got something that

1071
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,400
might be licensed worldwide that's the

1072
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,079
next

1073
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,920
you know the next huge thing that

1074
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,039
everybody wants to grow

1075
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,240
then

1076
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:02,239
it'd be foolish not to spend 30 50 100

1077
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,078
whatever it took to protect that that

1078
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,799
would just be a rounding error on all of

1079
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,680
the value that that thing creates and so

1080
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,519
um

1081
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,199
but the problem is you've got to you

1082
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,838
there's certain deadlines that you

1083
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,399
within which you need to file a patent

1084
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:18,719
application and it's usually before you

1085
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,200
know if you've got a major home run or

1086
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:24,639
the flavor of the month and so um i just

1087
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,078
the way i the way i talk to clients

1088
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,000
about this is i say do you think that

1089
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,800
this is going to be

1090
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,880
um increasing in value and demand in

1091
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,240
five years or will it have already kind

1092
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,039
of run its course

1093
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,879
and

1094
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,800
that's not an easily knowable question

1095
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,559
but they'll know it better than i would

1096
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,240
and if they believe that it's um that

1097
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,719
it's going to be increasing in demand in

1098
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,039
five years and 10 years then patenting

1099
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,598
is really kind of a no-brainer

1100
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,960
if they think that it will already be

1101
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,760
kind of passe or less interesting in in

1102
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,320
um

1103
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,920
in three or four years then by the time

1104
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,800
they got a patent nobody would be

1105
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,400
infringing it so you know it just it

1106
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,800
usually it turns into a business

1107
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,720
decision more than a um a legal decision

1108
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,839
if that makes sense legal or technical

1109
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,598
question

1110
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:12,320
yeah no it does and you mentioned

1111
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,559
deadlines and

1112
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,880
this might be a basic question but

1113
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,639
are you only able to apply for a patent

1114
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,160
before you've actually sold it or

1115
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,319
commercialized it

1116
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,960
it's a great question in the u.s there

1117
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,160
you can you can apply up to a year after

1118
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,159
the first

1119
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:31,279
public disclosure

1120
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:33,199
now what's interesting about that is

1121
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,599
and this might seem quite surprising it

1122
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,439
was kind of surprising to me um

1123
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,519
is that let's say you want a plant

1124
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,400
patent then what constitutes a public

1125
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:45,199
disclosure is public availability of

1126
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,039
that exact genotype in clone form

1127
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,799
so a lot of people have had some really

1128
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,279
special genetics that they've been

1129
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,680
propagating and

1130
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,760
growing themselves and selling flour but

1131
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,759
they've never sold any clones if you've

1132
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,079
never sold any clones you don't have a

1133
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,680
deadline yet for plant patenting even if

1134
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,119
you've been selling flour for a long

1135
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,279
time i ran this

1136
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,800
uh scenario past one of the senior

1137
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,640
examiners at the patent office and i

1138
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,160
said let's suppose somebody's had a

1139
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,480
they've been clonally propagating and

1140
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:13,279
selling flour for 30 years but nobody's

1141
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,358
ever

1142
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,880
nobody at them has ever had access to a

1143
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,559
clone he said yeah that's still

1144
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,720
patentable as a plant patent because the

1145
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:24,320
thing that you are saying is new

1146
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:26,319
is that living plant in clonal form

1147
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,079
so if that still hasn't been out there

1148
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,920
even though the flower has been now

1149
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,400
let's suppose you want a vsup a variety

1150
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,480
specific utility patent then anything

1151
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,639
that has been out there to the public

1152
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,719
for more than a year is not not eligible

1153
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,838
so let's say seeds have never been out

1154
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,759
there

1155
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,920
public hasn't been able to breed with it

1156
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,599
the um the clone form hasn't been out

1157
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,519
there but flour has been out there flour

1158
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,838
and extracts then you just have to be

1159
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,838
careful not to claim flour

1160
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,358
or extracts you could still claim the

1161
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:54,719
seeds you could still claim the breeding

1162
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,039
you can claim anything that hasn't been

1163
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:59,919
publicly available but

1164
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:02,320
prior sale of flour or extracts may make

1165
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,519
it that um that that's not part of what

1166
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,519
you could claim at that point

1167
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,319
and then just to

1168
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,880
there are no short answers when when you

1169
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,039
ask me a question but um

1170
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,039
when you go to the pvp system the pvp

1171
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,920
and upof system the deadlines are quite

1172
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,920
different they're defined based on

1173
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,838
um

1174
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,559
exploitation exploitation of a variety

1175
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,239
and that even that that term has a

1176
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,519
slightly different definition in a lot

1177
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,598
of different countries so first of all

1178
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,920
you have to dig in and ask yourself

1179
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,039
what what is the level of activity that

1180
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,039
creates that constitutes exploitation of

1181
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,119
the variety in this country

1182
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,000
and when did that start

1183
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,680
um

1184
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,199
so and then

1185
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,159
that's further complicated by the fact

1186
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:50,239
that for cannabis under upof

1187
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,920
you'd have two deadlines you have

1188
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,279
one deadline would be you have to file

1189
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,800
within a year of local exploitation and

1190
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,480
within four years of the first

1191
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,960
exploitation anywhere

1192
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,639
so let's say i start selling flour

1193
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,318
um which would i think would almost

1194
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,159
certainly be considered commercial

1195
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,318
exploitation i start selling flour this

1196
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,639
year i've got a hard four year deadline

1197
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,800
for anywhere in the world to get my upof

1198
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,559
application filed and i have a hard

1199
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,160
one-year deadline for for the country

1200
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,679
where i've been selling when i've been

1201
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:21,519
doing anything commercial with that plan

1202
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,000
so you know sometimes just licensing a

1203
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,920
plant into a country and authorizing

1204
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
someone to start cultivating it may or

1205
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,358
may not cross the threshold of

1206
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,000
commercial exploitation so you've really

1207
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,199
got to dig down and understand the rules

1208
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,760
in the countries where you're interested

1209
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,118
in protection but uh we're expecting as

1210
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,640
that four-year deadline approaches we're

1211
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,440
expecting to be filing a lot more

1212
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:43,358
applications in foreign countries uh

1213
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,280
under that uh that kind of deadline

1214
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,679
regime

1215
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,800
great great all right so so winding down

1216
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,239
here a bit

1217
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,480
um

1218
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,318
do you feel like there's an aversion to

1219
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,358
patents and ip protection in the

1220
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:59,119
cannabis breeder community um in general

1221
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,799
because again going back to when those

1222
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,800
first ones issued there's a lot of

1223
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,880
people on social media or sort of

1224
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,640
grandstanding that you know this is a

1225
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,880
community plan we shouldn't be patenting

1226
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:11,440
it at all has that sort of

1227
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,519
has that changed people more agreeable

1228
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,079
to it you know there's a lot there's a

1229
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,079
widely varying opinion about that and i

1230
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,079
respect that you know this is really a

1231
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,640
values thing for a lot of people it's

1232
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,560
it's community standards and values and

1233
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,480
principles and i would never want to

1234
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,559
talk anybody out of their values or

1235
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,240
their their deeply held principles but i

1236
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,400
would like to give them opportunities to

1237
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,559
think differently just in case they're

1238
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,920
interested in examining the question

1239
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,480
from another point of view and one of

1240
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,200
the posts that i wrote on my blog

1241
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,519
is it's titled something like

1242
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:45,838
lessons for from terrific from tom

1243
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:48,239
terrific on good fences and this

1244
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,920
actually makes reference to uh

1245
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,838
some controversy that happened with tom

1246
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,960
brady and trademarking the term tom

1247
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,000
terrific

1248
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,039
and um

1249
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,800
uh

1250
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,239
and that's a little bit i if i go into

1251
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,839
too much detail it will take too long

1252
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,559
but basically look at that blog and

1253
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,679
you'll see that it's really about

1254
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,119
whether it's it whether it's it goes to

1255
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,078
questions of whether it's right to own

1256
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,318
land

1257
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:14,318
whether it is ever right to um to have

1258
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:15,519
any any like ownership rights on

1259
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:17,920
something as

1260
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,920
natural and sacred as a cannabis plant

1261
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,159
and the point that i make is

1262
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,639
um you may think it's not but let's

1263
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,078
suppose that um

1264
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,440
well if when you get an intellectual

1265
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,200
property you're still allowed to let

1266
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,119
other people use your ip

1267
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,960
but you have the choice of keeping some

1268
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,039
people out it's like building a fence

1269
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,720
around your property you can let people

1270
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,000
through if you want but you also have

1271
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:39,598
the right to keep people off your

1272
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,960
property if you want to

1273
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,800
and

1274
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,079
and so that that's

1275
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,480
that's one angle on it the other angle i

1276
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,000
sometimes i talk about the ethics of

1277
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,800
patent and cannabis

1278
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,838
and

1279
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,599
um

1280
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,000
here's the angle on this one

1281
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,160
if you are a plant breeder your life

1282
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,159
your life's work is a creative work and

1283
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,519
you've been creating something special

1284
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,759
that people benefit from and that

1285
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,039
somebody might make a lot of money on

1286
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,520
um

1287
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,679
but unlike somebody who writes a song or

1288
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:12,159
writes a book or makes a movie you don't

1289
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:14,078
have any automatic protection

1290
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,078
in the us and almost the entire world

1291
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,760
there's automatic copyright protection

1292
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,079
for those kinds of creatives works like

1293
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,520
songs and books and movies as soon as

1294
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,039
it's created you don't even have to

1295
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,960
register anything you can get stronger

1296
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,880
rights by registration but you've got

1297
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,920
automatic copyright from the moment it's

1298
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,920
created

1299
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,838
unfortunately that doesn't exist for

1300
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,200
plant varieties so you've got these

1301
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,838
other creative people these plant

1302
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,519
breeders who very much like an author or

1303
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,358
a photographer or

1304
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,358
or whatever they have this great

1305
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,838
creative work that has tremendous value

1306
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:45,519
but if they don't protect it

1307
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:46,719
they don't get paid the same way

1308
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,639
somebody can

1309
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,358
who just creates different kinds of work

1310
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,118
that has copyright protection so

1311
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,199
if you if you look at it that way you

1312
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,119
might say all right um

1313
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,799
maybe i wish patents weren't the way to

1314
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,240
do this and maybe i don't really like

1315
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,400
patents especially the ones that can be

1316
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,759
abused but as a way for somebody to

1317
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,599
protect their life's work and to get

1318
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,160
some value out of their life's work and

1319
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,079
have it be their living instead of just

1320
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,199
a hobby you know who's rich enough to i

1321
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,800
don't know very many people in the

1322
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,919
cannabis industry that are independently

1323
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,519
wealthy and can just breed for fun

1324
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,760
most of them need to find a way to pay

1325
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,960
their bills from their work

1326
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,160
and so

1327
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,599
patenting

1328
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,118
or other kinds of intellectual property

1329
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,440
protection just kind of level the

1330
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,599
playing field with copyrights and other

1331
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,519
kinds of creative work and i think that

1332
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,960
plant breeders are every bit as worthy

1333
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,679
of getting paid as authors and um

1334
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,318
sculptors and and fine artists and and

1335
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,318
so on and so i to me the intellectual

1336
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,239
property protection just helps them get

1337
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,159
paid for their work

1338
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,639

1339
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:51,279
