years at cam at 24 Tim will present

48
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,280
characterization of less studied

49
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,639
cannabis phytochemicals which

50
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,919
investigates the pharmacological

51
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,719
physiochemical and basic toxicological

52
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,000
characteristics of cannabis

53
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,359
phytochemicals during our conversation

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,479
we discuss

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,440
how Tim and his team choose which

56
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,799
phytochemicals to study what makes the

57
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,479
Varin canono particularly interesting

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,719
the difference between chemically

59
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:46,399
derived compounds and plant derived

60
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,840
compounds which phytochemicals show the

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,120
most promise for Therapeutics and

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,000
modifying phytochemicals to improve

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,920
their

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,840
effectiveness before we get to my

65
00:02:53,919 --> 00:03:00,000

82
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,199
LEF good morning Tim thanks for joining

83
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,639
us on the podcast uh thanks for having

84
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,959
me Ben I'm excited to uh to talk to you

85
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,719
today and and excited for uh the

86
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,000
upcoming conference uh the canmed

87
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,000
conference in Florida in a couple weeks

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,799
yeah no it's it's coming soon we're

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
definitely excited and I'm excited to

90
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,319
talk with you today about the work that

91
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,359
you've done to investigate some of the

92
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,759
Lesser known compounds in cannabis but

93
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,719
before we kind of get into which

94
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,800
compounds and cannaboids you studied and

95
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,759
the results that you found I wanted to

96
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,960
ask what specifically you were

97
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,479
investigating um maybe more more so what

98
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:40,120
basic questions were you looking to

99
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:44,279
answer with this work sure sure so um as

100
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,639
as most folks in this space um are aware

101
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,679
um the the the cannabis plant is

102
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,240
incredibly complex there's a number of

103
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,478
different cannabinoids flavonoids

104
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,360
polyphenols um and well some of them are

105
00:04:55,478 --> 00:05:00,560
are fairly well researched there's many

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,319
many others that have just a smattering

107
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,680
of information here and there um and so

108
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,199
uh what what we wanted to do was was

109
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,600
take a look at some of these less

110
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,600
studied a little bit more rare or

111
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,919
sometimes called minor canabo um and

112
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,960
just get some some basic information off

113
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,639
of them that can lead us in directions

114
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,399
where we can decide if we want to

115
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,960
potentially commercially pursue them for

116
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,599
health benefits or use them as a

117
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,799
scaffold in our drug development program

118
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,360
to use Medicinal Chemistry to optimize

119
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,199
them further for therapeutic

120
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,560
potential and so with with this work um

121
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,478
you know we chose we chose a number of

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,680
of canabo we looked at both the Delta 8

123
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:51,918
and the Delta 9 isomers of

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:56,600
thcv um as well as cbdv CBG v

125
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:58,038
cbcv um and CBC and can Flav vanet there

126
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,319
was there was a lot I had to think about

127
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:02,399
it for a second um

128
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,680
and again some of these have have much

129
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,719
more data in the literature than others

130
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:13,680
um and so the the basic information was

131
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,479
really around adme uh PK data um some

132
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,280
physical chemical properties uh of of

133
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:22,038
these cannabinoids um a little bit of

134
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,598
pharmacology work where we chose some

135
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:29,038
selected uh receptors or ion channels uh

136
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:32,598
probing for for their activity at those

137
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:35,038
um and again just to get a a basic sense

138
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:39,000
of where these stand so that we can

139
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:42,038
follow up with with more comprehensive

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,199
invo um biology studies where we can

141
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:47,038
really nail down efficacy and safety

142
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,199
right no and I was hoping you might help

143
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,279
me or help me and I guess the audience

144
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,560
to sort of Define a few of these terms

145
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,399
so you know looking through your

146
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,639
abstract in what you're investigating

147
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,239
with these different compounds um

148
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,759
there's pharmacology ology

149
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
physiochemistry and toxicology so I was

150
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,199
hoping you could kind of Define what are

151
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,879
those terms like what what are you

152
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,919
really looking at so maybe start with

153
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,720
pharmacology sure sure so so

154
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:16,318
pharmacology is is really just how a

155
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,639
chemical molecule or some some

156
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,960
entity interacts with with our system um

157
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:27,759
most often um by binding to and

158
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:31,399
activating or having some effect on a

159
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,160
receptor or again an ion Channel um lots

160
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,439
of lots of different ways you can you

161
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,800
can approach that but to boil it down

162
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:42,560
it's basically how does the chemical do

163
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,598
what it does in in the body um uh

164
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,879
physical chemistry is basically just the

165
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,680
chemical properties of the compound

166
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,879
right so you know everything from as

167
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,720
basic as its molecular weight to say

168
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:01,479
solubility so in various uh solvents or

169
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,759
um phosphate buffered saline how soluble

170
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:07,639
is this compound um which is related to

171
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:11,400
how much we could potentially mix or

172
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,879
dose um easily um which is it is which

173
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,399
is related to you know kind of the

174
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,158
ability to commercialize it um or again

175
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,918
identify um a characteristic that we

176
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:24,279
might be able to improve

177
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:26,240
upon um and toxicology is is pretty

178
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,598
straightforward obviously it's just

179
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,158
really how how safe are these and

180
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:35,639
there's there's many many many ways to

181
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:39,718
approach um assessing toxicology of um

182
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:41,679
uh of a chemical or or a molecule um in

183
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,720
this case we decided to go with a

184
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,838
celegans model um that we had some some

185
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,080
familiarity with uh in with some

186
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,519
previous work that we found to be a

187
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,959
really good early place to start that

188
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,440
gives us a good sign of both some acute

189
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:59,719
and subchronic toxicity um that we can

190
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,320
screen fairly rapidly compared compared

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,680
to a more traditional invivo rodent

192
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,480
model um but that again gives us an

193
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:10,879
early indication of this is one we need

194
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,480
to do some more work on or this is one H

195
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,120
right now we we just don't think it's

196
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,200
it's one we want to pursue okay great

197
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,679
thanks for that so in looking at this in

198
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,600
the compounds that you studied were

199
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,759
there any surprises or sort of results

200
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,200
that you weren't

201
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,679
expecting um yes and no um so there were

202
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,360
there were definitely a few things and

203
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,120
and this was again one of one of the

204
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,759
goals uh some of these we we looked at

205
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,399
purely from a a scientific interest uh

206
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:45,838
perspective um so for example the the

207
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,320
Delta 8 and the Delta 9 thcv isomers um

208
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,000
if you if you look across the

209
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,278
marketplace right now um a lot of the

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,799
thcv isolate products contain a ratio of

211
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,120
both isomer in in every direction and

212
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:02,838
permutation you can think of so we

213
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,000
wanted to understand a little bit more

214
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,120
um about each separately and you know

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,759
what are the the the pros and cons or

216
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,679
the benefits of having more Delta 8

217
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:18,078
versus delta 9 or vice versa um and so

218
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:20,078
while they really you know are are very

219
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:24,919
similar much in the same way that Delta

220
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:27,278
8 THC and Delta 9 THC only differ by the

221
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,519
location of the double bond on the

222
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,159
carbon right that that's molecular

223
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,000
that's the only difference um but when

224
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,838
we did some of our our binding and

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,440
functional assays we found that Delta 8

226
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:45,200
seemed to be a little bit stronger uh uh

227
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:49,040
antagonist at CB1 compared to Delta 9

228
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,160
thcv UM and then the exact opposite for

229
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,240
uh the CB2 receptor Delta 9 thcv was a

230
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,679
little bit stronger antagonist than

231
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,759
delta8 so again the the implications

232
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:02,399
there once you start to understand some

233
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:05,159
of this pharmacology you can either

234
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,278
specifically generate a ratio of the two

235
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:11,799
isomers to drive a tailored effect or

236
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,919
isolate and purify just one isomer um

237
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,120
and and get get the the most bang for

238
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:20,078
your buck if if you will okay so you

239
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:24,480
were investigating Delta 8 THC V and

240
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:27,120
Delta 9 THC v um and there are a lot of

241
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,440
V's when you're kind of rattling off all

242
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,240
the different compounds so um and I know

243
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,480
that's that's the Varin

244
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,759
um variety I don't know I don't know

245
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,920
what the term is there but so what

246
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,838
specifically was interesting about

247
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,759
varens that you know there are so many

248
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,160
of them in in this list well so so the

249
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,720
varens are are a little bit interesting

250
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,679
to us right and again that the

251
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,600
difference between um the varen and and

252
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,599
the nonin canabo acronyms that you're

253
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,120
you're familiar with is right again just

254
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,480
the number of carbons in the alkal tail

255
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:10,720
right um so the varens have have three

256
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:15,199
um so CBD V has three CBD has five right

257
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,040
and and so for for a while and I think

258
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:20,000
it still persists a little bit today

259
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,599
folks tend to look at the number of

260
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,839
carbons in that in that tail when they

261
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,560
talk about Agonist activity at CB1 um so

262
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,160
typically kind of an indicator of how

263
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,958
intoxic

264
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:37,000
um a canabo may be um we we don't pursue

265
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:41,399
anything intoxicating but in in this

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
case we see that the Varin are are

267
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,120
slightly more pharmacologically

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,399
promiscuous um and are a little bit more

269
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,560
like CBD in that regard they they don't

270
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,320
take a hammer to really any one

271
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:57,559
particular Target or receptor a site but

272
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,760
seem to kind of have this

273
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:04,479
General General like AC ity uh across

274
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,639
several systems that both contribute to

275
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,199
health benefits or or therapeutic uh

276
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,278
potential but also likely safety as we

277
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:14,799
see with

278
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,399
CBD interesting so in doing research for

279
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,919
for the conversation today I was

280
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,720
checking out your website at nalu bio

281
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:24,479
and there's a lot of talk about having

282
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,480
um chemistry derived compounds versus

283
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,159
hemp derive compounds so in doing this

284
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,839
work which were you using were you using

285
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,319
hemp derived or chemically derived so

286
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,240
these these were all synthetic

287
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,278
chemically derived um uh compounds um

288
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,519
which is which is our platform um at

289
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:47,399
nalu bio um so so we believe that the

290
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,919
synthetic uh synthetic mimics of of

291
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,759
phyto canabo that you can extract from

292
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:56,919
the plant or that are present in

293
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:59,278
processed cannabis material um um offer

294
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,919
offer some advantages and so that's why

295
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,000
we've we've decided to go down that

296
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:06,799
route um we understand that there's

297
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,240
there's a lot of negativity around the

298
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,838
word synthetic uh especially in this

299
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,839
space and and especially after um you

300
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,639
know the years of the the the K2 and

301
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,600
spice uh issues that that we all are

302
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,759
very well aware of um but we're hoping

303
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,480
that we can kind of get over that stigma

304
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:29,560
um and embrace the the what the

305
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,600
synthetic approach has to offer from a

306
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,439
uh both consistency standpoint from

307
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,399
batch to batch consistency which is

308
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,040
achievable with with with plant- derived

309
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,278
extracts for sure um but also that that

310
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,639
we're able to explore some of these more

311
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:47,720
minor or rare canabo that at this point

312
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,399
um the genetics don't exist uh or or

313
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:55,040
they're in process to make extracting

314
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,639
from the plant not very feasible uh or

315
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,879
not sustainable certainly from an

316
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,919
environmental

317
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,000
standpoint yeah yeah so what what kind

318
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,439
of levels are we talking about like some

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,278
of these compounds what is the typical

320
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,600
amount that the plant produces and what

321
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:11,078
were the levels that you were using in

322
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,278
your

323
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,919
investigation right right so i' I'd have

324
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,000
to look to to get really accurate

325
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:21,479
answers for you but most of these very

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,679
very small amounts I know um cbdv there

327
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,519
there are some varieties um from Africa

328
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,958
that that produce I think four or five%

329
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,399
maybe a little bit more um I I don't

330
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:35,638
know if GW has done some of that work as

331
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,839
well um but but very small amounts

332
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,079
nothing like like delta9 THC um or CBD

333
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,680
at this point although I will say that

334
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:48,599
um uh phos has uh recently put out a

335
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:52,838
press release that that they have um

336
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,920
achieved uh genetics for a very high um

337
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,440
uh Delta 9 thcv plant uh that they're

338
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,639
growing and and uh extracting from

339
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,279
so wonder if you can explain a little

340
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,519
bit about how are you kind of deriving

341
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:09,039
these chemically um is it similar I know

342
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,919
that for example with Delta 8 THC um

343
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:15,679
it's kind of using the CBD molecule and

344
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:18,519
and treating it with acid to sort of um

345
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,278
convert it into Delta 8 THC is it a

346
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,278
similar process that you're using now

347
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,679
where you're using a kind of canabo as a

348
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:29,759
base and then transforming it in some

349
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:33,120
cases yes um ultimately how we approach

350
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,440
the synthesis for for any cannabinoid is

351
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,480
tailored specifically to that to that

352
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,759
canabo so as we begin to explore what's

353
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,759
the best route we we look at various

354
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:49,039
input materials what's going to give us

355
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:52,120
um the best yield uh the best Purity um

356
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,278
and then as we we begin to hone in on on

357
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,278
What's That optimized synthesis we

358
00:16:54,278 --> 00:17:00,000
further tweak it as we need to go from

359
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,278
you know bench scale up to say kilogram

360
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,199
scale synthesis work and there's there's

361
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:10,160
some more tweaks in there so um the the

362
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:13,199
very long answer is some rely on uh

363
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,000
other canabo as as input materials

364
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,919
others use um other input materials like

365
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,519
divinol or olivetol um which are very

366
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,240
common uh in this space um but each one

367
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,639
each one is different and

368
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,640
specific right and now of the

369
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,840
phytochemicals you studied which have

370
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,200
the most promise and and

371
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:37,319
why that's a very interesting question

372
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,679
so the with these basic studies it's

373
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,079
it's a little bit of a tease um so

374
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,360
you're you're you're just kind of

375
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:48,480
scratching the surface enough to get

376
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:52,359
very excited um about a few of them um

377
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,839
for for for a few different uh reasons

378
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,119
um and others you you kind of are left

379
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,079
scratching your head that you thought

380
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:01,000
going into it well I really thought we

381
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:04,319
might see something there um

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,319
so across the board more work is is

383
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:10,319
going to be done um but I can say that

384
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:13,000
that with the work we just completed um

385
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,158
in in my opinion based on the data we

386
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,240
have um I would think

387
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:23,240
CBG um and can flaven a are particularly

388
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,519
interesting um you know can flaven a has

389
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,720
has been published on uh a little bit

390
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,279
over the years uh it occurs you know

391
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,798
minute amount

392
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,599
uh in the plant which has hampered it to

393
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,038
some extent hampered its research to

394
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:40,119
some extent um but it has fairly

395
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,679
profound uh anti-inflammatory properties

396
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:45,000
um and as a a polyphenol it's it's

397
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,519
pretty interesting to explore that space

398
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,279
it's a little bit of a a departure from

399
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:53,839
from say the traditional canabo we talk

400
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,798
about um and in the case of CBG V this

401
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,439
is one again there's there's limited

402
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:02,119
information out there about it um but it

403
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,400
it set itself apart uh from from the

404
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:08,599
pack um on a couple of key adme metrics

405
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,320
like uh um like Half-Life and microsomal

406
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:15,240
stability um that looked a lot more like

407
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:18,158
what you see in typical Therapeutics uh

408
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,120
in the marketplace today which is was a

409
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,440
very nice surprise for us we we did not

410
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,798
expect that oh so explain that a little

411
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
bit more

412
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:30,798
so um what

413
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,880
specifically yeah so so with with CBGB

414
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,519
so we we did several different um

415
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,520
solubility

416
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:41,079
assays um as working with canabo a

417
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,679
common issue is that they're not very

418
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,879
soluble um and so we wanted to

419
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,880
understand where these where these fall

420
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,919
in relation to some standards um so we

421
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,400
did some kinetic solubility some

422
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,000
thermodynamic

423
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,880
solubility um and across all of these

424
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,679
what you see is that you can achieve the

425
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,360
highest con rtion with

426
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,600
cbv compared to all of the other

427
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,399
phytochemicals we we tested in those

428
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:11,079
assays um which which just basically

429
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,480
means it's it's more soluble um than

430
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:16,798
most which is a which is a very good

431
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,960
thing um and on

432
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,918
metabolics well just that you can it's

433
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,480
it's easier to to mix and get into

434
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,240
higher

435
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,000
concentrations um in say a beverage or

436
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,798
an o oil or a format where you can you

437
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,839
can

438
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,960
deliver you can deliver more of the

439
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,639
compound without it precipitating out or

440
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,279
you can maintain homogeneity of of your

441
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,520
finished good um so that when someone is

442
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,240
taking it you can you can potentially

443
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,279
deliver less compound and achieve the

444
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,839
same effect got it so it's less so sort

445
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,240
of its interaction with the body but

446
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,279
it's it's more of a manufacturing

447
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,359
problem that it's solving for it's going

448
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,678
to give you a more consistent

449
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:06,439
product it's a little bit of both

450
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,480
actually um and so so on the um on the

451
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,080
the microsomal stability and the and the

452
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,200
half-life work that that we did which is

453
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:16,240
basically you're looking at at how the

454
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,080
molecule is is moving across um uh

455
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,558
different microsomes in this case liver

456
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:27,399
microsomes um and so what again what we

457
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:29,440
saw is that CBG V had had the greatest

458
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,440
halflife so it more of it was sticking

459
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,038
around which speaks more again to its

460
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,400
metabolic profile but also that it was

461
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,319
it had a better transporter profile it

462
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,960
it was able to move more freely um than

463
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,119
some of these other canabo um which

464
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,360
again is is just it it caught us by

465
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,959
surprise and and certainly now uh gives

466
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:53,359
us gives us motivation to continue

467
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,278
following up with some uh some invivo

468
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,759
work right and I'm glad you brought up

469
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:58,119
that term because I wanted to talk about

470
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:01,679
sort of the difference between you know

471
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:03,839
inv Ro and invivo and I know you can't

472
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,720
really predict the future but when

473
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:10,199
moving from from inv vitro to invivo how

474
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,360
can sort of these um results or like you

475
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,880
said you get excited about a molecule

476
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,278
how can then when you translate that

477
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,919
into invivo how can that sort of how can

478
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:20,798
things

479
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,880
change it's

480
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:27,839
it's usually I i' say the the the

481
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:31,679
translatability from inv vitro to invivo

482
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:34,158
is pretty High um depending on depending

483
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,200
on the data you're using to to

484
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,720
inform the other right so if the invitro

485
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,038
data say is um is inv vitro biology data

486
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,960
about say the the pharmacology so the

487
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,839
binding and the functional assays we ran

488
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,840
um so if you if you get a good

489
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:54,480
understanding of this molecule has this

490
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,599
activity at at this receptor and this

491
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,038
receptor

492
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:01,199
mediates these effects or

493
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,038
interactions you can follow that up in

494
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,679
Vivo and and typically you can you can

495
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:10,759
see right so for example if you see um

496
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:12,640
CB1 agonism right you would say okay now

497
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:15,798
we're going to put this into an invivo

498
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,919
model and subsequently we'll see

499
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:23,879
analgesia right that's a common Delta 9

500
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:26,759
THC effect in in rodents um or any uh

501
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,320
CB1 Agonist with with really any decent

502
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,919
efficacy

503
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:36,278
right so when we're talking when you

504
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:38,200
were talking about CBG v um So based on

505
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:40,759
the pharmacology there like do you have

506
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,200
any idea like what sort of conditions

507
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:45,480
that might be helpful

508
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,519
for it's a little bit tricky on the on

509
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,558
the pharmacology side of things we have

510
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:53,240
to do a little bit more work there but

511
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:55,720
in um in some of the uh inv Vivo work

512
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,240
that we've done um that I hope to be

513
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,319
able to to have some more data to

514
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,519
present in a few weeks

515
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:05,599
um it seems to be uh very stimulating um

516
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:09,000
which is also interesting so we we're

517
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:11,359
seeing a dose effect there um which in

518
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,519
the model we used can sometimes be

519
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:17,000
predictive of uh neuroprotective effects

520
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,679
um which can come into play when you're

521
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,679
looking at say traumatic brain injury or

522
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,559
Alzheimer's um there's lots of different

523
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,720
ways to approach those and and they're

524
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:29,798
very complex studies but um I'm I'm I'm

525
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:34,240
pretty excited at the chance to to

526
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:36,278
explore CBG CBGB further um in in some

527
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,120
of these models and really start to

528
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:40,278
understand what we've got on our hands

529
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:42,839
interesting and now have you done work

530
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:44,200
to investigate sort of combining these

531
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,079
different compounds to see what the

532
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,600
effects are I mean I know that uh the

533
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:54,079
Entourage effect is uh is

534
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:57,240
real we haven't yet um so so our

535
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:00,158
Approach at this point is um really

536
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,278
trying to to screen these minor or rare

537
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,919
canabo you know through our platform um

538
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,398
and get an idea or or rank them really

539
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,600
by those that we

540
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:13,319
feel have have uh the data behind them

541
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:17,119
to pursue further for either a

542
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:22,119
commercial um pipeline or to use as a

543
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:25,000
scaffold for our therapeutic uh program

544
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:28,038
um but uh but at this point we we

545
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,919
haven't combined any we think we're

546
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:33,240
we're hoping that we're adding value by

547
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,799
adding to the knowledge we know about

548
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,919
these individual

549
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:42,000
cannabinoids um and well I I don't think

550
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,919
we'll we'll ever um be able to recreate

551
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,038
the chemical complexity um that leads to

552
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,640
the Entourage effect I think our goal is

553
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:52,759
is that if we understand enough about

554
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,880
these cannabinoids or or other

555
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,839
phytochemicals individually we can start

556
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,520
to thoughtfully put them together

557
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,519
uh with with other phyl chemicals or

558
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,319
with existing you know bioactive

559
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:10,000
neutraceuticals or health supplements to

560
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:13,000
to Really bolster specific effects um

561
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,798
well not having to worry about the the

562
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,278
Myriad of other other chemicals that may

563
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:19,319
be in the

564
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,720
product right no and that was something

565
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:22,480
that I noticed when I was looking at the

566
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,278
website as well was sort of this idea of

567
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,798
sort of combining uh the the compounds

568
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,720
the cannaboids with other vitamins or

569
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:31,599
probiotics itics proteins things like

570
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,640
that so is that that's something that

571
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,240
you you're

572
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,159
investigating yeah yeah so the the the

573
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,759
the commercial side of the businesses is

574
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:43,840
actively exploring um existing uh

575
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:46,278
combination supplements and how the

576
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,119
introduction or the addition of a canabo

577
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:52,720
or or more than one canabo may further

578
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:56,479
enhance their effectiveness so um we've

579
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:00,120
identified several that have a a very

580
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,079
solid um uh uh uh Clin clinical

581
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,359
literature space behind them you know

582
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,359
they're very solid as far as efficacy is

583
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:09,398
concerned from a safety profile they

584
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,879
look good um and so we're we're now

585
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:15,278
taking what we've learned about some

586
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,039
canabo and putting those in there and

587
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,359
eventually once we we start getting

588
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:23,440
these these manufactured uh the intent

589
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:26,079
is to do some some small uh clinical

590
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,480
trials or or focus groups to understand

591
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:34,199
their advocacy in humans excellent and

592
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,278
now which compounds um are you looking

593
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,038
to kind of move into the next phase of

594
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,919
uh of your

595
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:46,278
work definitely uh well definitely can

596
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:50,320
flaven a and CBGB um as I mentioned um

597
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:52,359
they it's a little early on those to to

598
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,918
be involved in the in the combination

599
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,839
products we're just talking about um but

600
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,519
but we definitely want to understand a

601
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,759
little bit more about those uh and and

602
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,200
as I said if if if there's potential for

603
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:09,240
them on their own that's that's one

604
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,200
thing um but the really interesting part

605
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,599
about this the nalo kind of ecosystem is

606
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,319
that we have this commercial side where

607
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:21,079
we're developing uh the synthetic

608
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,000
approaches for these phyto canabo mimics

609
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:25,480
but that also informs us on the

610
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,319
therapeutic side so our drug development

611
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:32,278
side where we can take what we know

612
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:34,599
about existing phyto canabo or

613
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,759
phytochemicals and do some of this work

614
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:39,558
that that we're talking about today and

615
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,640
then say you know what that has a lot of

616
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:44,839
therapeutic potential but it's not very

617
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,960
druglike it's not very soluble or it's

618
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:48,519
rapidly

619
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,399
metabolized um so how can we use

620
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,839
Medicinal Chemistry to modify that

621
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:56,000
molecule and improve upon those

622
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,599
characteristics while also either

623
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,960
retaining or improving the

624
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,038
pharmacological activity for the

625
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,600
indication or or the end point that that

626
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:08,200
we're looking at um so really it's it's

627
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,158
it's this like I say it's kind of this

628
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,319
feedback loop loop ecosystem we have

629
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,600
where no matter what data we're

630
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,200
collecting on either side of the

631
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,839
business we're learning more and more

632
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,080
and more about these different structure

633
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:24,119
activity relationships and how uh we can

634
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,599
take that knowledge to inform really

635
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:28,678
either side of our business so that's

636
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:31,879
interesting so for example when you were

637
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,600
talking before about CBG V and it's um

638
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,278
it being soluble and that being a good

639
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:39,079
characteristic are you sort of saying

640
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:41,319
that you can look at the structure of

641
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,319
that molecule and maybe apply some of

642
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:47,158
that to maybe another molecule that

643
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:50,759
isn't as soluble to try to give it that

644
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,399
um ability you you could

645
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,879
um typically what what we're trying to

646
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:58,479
do and what a lot of folks do with

647
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:02,360
structure activity relationships is is

648
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:05,360
by looking at the properties of a number

649
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:07,479
of of molecules so a large sample size

650
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,439
you start you can start to see patterns

651
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,880
emerge where then you can you can more

652
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,159
confidently say okay so making a

653
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:19,000
modification here seems to be critical

654
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,760
for x uh and so when you get large

655
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,599
enough data sets you can you can start

656
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:25,640
to tease those things apart and then

657
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:29,439
absolutely you can you can start to uh

658
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:33,320
tinker molecularly tinker um with with

659
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:37,080
purpose um and so we have a uh the the

660
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:41,240
first phase of anything we do um at nalo

661
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:43,879
is is our our insilico um uh platform so

662
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,200
so we have several different modeling

663
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,278
capabilities where we will put some of

664
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,720
these rare uh minor canabo we also use

665
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,079
it for novel chemical entities that we

666
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,440
we develop for the therapeutic side and

667
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:59,558
so we're we're able to model how these

668
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:03,679
might interact with different biological

669
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:05,759
systems from metabolism to PK as well as

670
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,480
their pharmacology so how they interact

671
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,440
with certain receptors in the brain and

672
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,399
so that's kind of our first pass and

673
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,759
when we see favorable results come out

674
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:17,439
of that work that's when we move into

675
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,599
the type of work we're talking about now

676
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,480
so we try to confirm that the data we've

677
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:28,480
we've modeled using you know PM work

678
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,440
adme work uh inv vitro studies um and so

679
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,599
that's step two and and if we we

680
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,038
continue to see favorable results we we

681
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:38,719
keep we keep investigating them until we

682
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:42,079
have a very very strong um profile and

683
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,399
rationale for commercialization or uh

684
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,678
therapeutic

685
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:49,918
work about how long does that whole

686
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:53,360
process take it it depends um it depends

687
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,840
on if if um if we have the target

688
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:58,959
validated from a from say molecular

689
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:01,879
docking perspective um

690
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,880
it's not too bad um if we have to

691
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,559
validate a new Target um that that can

692
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,080
take us you know a couple weeks maybe um

693
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,599
depending on the complexity and you know

694
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:16,398
depending on if we're looking at say the

695
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:18,480
orthosteric sites versus alisic sites um

696
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:22,719
what kind of training sets are already

697
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,399
available um but it's it's it's pretty

698
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,079
amazing uh how much this has evolved in

699
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:33,439
just the last few years um especially

700
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:35,918
with with machine learning and and AI um

701
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,200
it's it's evolving very very quickly and

702
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,120
becoming an incredibly useful tool um

703
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,278
that I think most biotechs and Pharma

704
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,839
companies are are becoming actively

705
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:49,880
reliant on um and it's certainly been

706
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:52,599
working very well for us um and again

707
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,000
any any data we collect you know

708
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:56,638
anything we collect um whether it's our

709
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,079
data or something we find in the

710
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:01,479
literature we can put that data back

711
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:05,398
into our system and it's going to

712
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,558
refine its its predictions going going

713
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,638
uh on so that we get more accuracy

714
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,720
better confidence in in what our models

715
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:14,719
are predicting and that's the ins

716
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,278
silicle work that you're talking

717
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,079
about so even beyond that so you have

718
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,919
the in silico in vitro inv Vivo and all

719
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,879
that how about that whole process how

720
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,000
long does that all take yeah so so on

721
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,559
the the commercial side so if we're just

722
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,759
trying to stand a rare say CBGB for

723
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:35,319
example if if we wanted to work that

724
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,798
through to the point we have enough

725
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:40,839
confidence to um to start exploring how

726
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:44,240
to how to synthesize it and optimize

727
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:47,439
that synthesis you know we could we

728
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,599
could maybe maybe six months to a year

729
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,960
before we really have a good

730
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,879
understanding maybe a little bit longer

731
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,360
um if we if we really wanted to explore

732
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,399
a couple different end points um on the

733
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,000
therap cutic side obviously that's a you

734
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:06,439
know the drug development uh pipeline is

735
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
is a much much much longer uh game um

736
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,240
and the stakes are a little bit a little

737
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,398
bit different right so um so if we were

738
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:18,719
to use again just CBGB for example um as

739
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:19,679
a scaffold and using our um computerated

740
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,319
drug

741
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:27,079
design you know to say generate you know

742
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:30,320
500 600 novel chemical entities based

743
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:32,639
off of CB bgv then running those through

744
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,000
say we get a few that that look okay we

745
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,919
may do another round of computerated

746
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,519
drug design or or Medicinal Chemistry to

747
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:44,358
further refine those uh those ncees into

748
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,679
potential hits that then we start to

749
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:51,398
again verify use physically in these

750
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,639
very basic um inv vitro assays um and

751
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:56,199
and as you know then from there it's

752
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,880
it's more refinement and more refinement

753
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:01,679
and more work and until eventually get a

754
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,680
a lead candidate um that that you really

755
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,719
want to push forward and and hope that

756
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,598
you get into first in human studies and

757
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:12,159
and clinical work but uh

758
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:15,800
that that you know probably a couple

759
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:19,159
years um you know at best right you

760
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,119
might get lucky but um but yeah we're

761
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:24,358
we're we're we're moving along at a

762
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,358
pretty good clip for our size um but

763
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:28,319
yeah that's if somebody figures out how

764
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:32,358
to speed that process up they'll they'll

765
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,119
make a lot of money right and so so the

766
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:37,239
goal is if I'm hearing you correctly is

767
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,280
to actually find a novel compound that

768
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:43,000
sort of mimics the action of the natural

769
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,519
compound and then commercialize that

770
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,239
correct or or we enhance that activity

771
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:54,639
right so we can we can explore ways to

772
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:58,759
um say change the you know we can try to

773
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:03,799
to make modifications and maybe say

774
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:07,079
um add bias to to these molecules or

775
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,920
which which signaling pathway they may

776
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,599
they may prefer over another knowing

777
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,720
that activating one pathway may have

778
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,880
common side effects that we want to

779
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:21,879
avoid um and so so that's that's just an

780
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,880
example of of one way that we can we can

781
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,640
keep working on this and and again get

782
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,318
to hopefully a a very safe an effective

783
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:33,920
therapeutic or or a library that we can

784
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:36,079
we can begin to use structure activity

785
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,720
relationship work to to really try to

786
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:42,560
find the key components that we can uh

787
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,480
exploit excellent all right Tim well

788
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,519
winding down here before I let you go I

789
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,358
wanted to give you an opportunity to

790
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:50,800
share any other resources that you think

791
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,759
folks might be interested in reading

792
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,359
more about if they're interested in this

793
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,599
topic um and also any information about

794
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:00,000
you and nalu bio that you'd like to

795
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,760
share uh please do so and I'll be happy

796
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,679
to put any links in the show description

797
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,440
so people can find it

798
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:09,719
easy yeah um I'm you know I think uh I

799
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,200
don't have any specific resources um you

800
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,199
can you can check out our website and

801
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,639
learn a little bit more about about what

802
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:20,078
we're trying to to do at nalo in our um

803
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:22,719
approach to to synthetic cannabinoids um

804
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,400
whether it be you know synthetic mimics

805
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:28,199
of phytos or um our therapeutic uh

806
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,280
pipeline um

807
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,000
um yeah I can't really I can't really

808
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:37,720
think of any other other resources to uh

809
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,519
to send folks to I will say that um uh

810
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:41,879
the majority of this data if not if not

811
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:44,559
all of it uh will will begin packaging

812
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,800
up and um we'll hopefully get get out in

813
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,519
a peer-reviewed publication here uh

814
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,280
before the end of the year um and and

815
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,639
hope to have many many other

816
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,640
Publications uh following excellent yeah

817
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,118
and in the meantime if uh you want to

818
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,719
have a conversation with Tim and the

819
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:02,680
folks at nalo bio make sure you come out

820
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:05,118
to canmed and uh and pick his

821
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:06,719
brain yeah yeah definitely looking

822
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,240
forward to it it's going to be a g to be

823
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,399
a great conference yes we are very much

824
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:14,000
