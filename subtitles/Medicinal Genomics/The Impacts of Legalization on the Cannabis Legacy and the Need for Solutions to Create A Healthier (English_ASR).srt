1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,000
first i want to thank all of you for

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,720
being here

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,039
i see a lot of people that are a part of

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,960
what we call the legacy project in the

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,479
room so thanks for supporting your

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,759
teammates

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,519
um

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,519
i'm going to get out my glasses because

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,839
i'm going to get nervous

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,000
um today we're going to discuss some of

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,480
the hurdles the emerald triangle legacy

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,640
operators have faced

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,599
the vast collections of genetics they

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,599
hold

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,759
some of the solutions being created to

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,079
empower both the operators and the

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,679
genetic diversity and how not

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,558
integrating the knowledge and the

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,719
genetics these legacies

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,919
of these legacies impact the future of

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,679
medicine and science around cannabis

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,719
in 2014 humboldt county claimed over 10

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,439
000

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,399
small medical cannabis farmers today we

25
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,558
have less than 1300 cannabis licenses in

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,600
humboldt and trinity county

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,878
these communities hold over six decades

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,200
of experience with breeding cultivation

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,600
practices and medicine making around

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
cannabis and are being shut out of the

31
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,519
new industry

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
the new industry that was legalized

33
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,519
around the premise that cannabis is a

34
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,599
very diverse medicine

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,560
yet as this industry grows and the

36
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:25,679
legacies get shut out we are losing vast

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,759
amounts of important genetics research

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,479
and experience that can move us all

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,799
forward towards a healthier future

40
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,039

started

72

i discovered the plant as a teenager

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,519

74
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,199
anxious

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
miracle that made my life better and

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,560
gave me this

80
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,598
opportunity to

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,158
find

82
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,518
self-confidence and sort of organize my

83
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,878
life and really think through my

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,239
problems and so as a lawyer when i got

85
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,439
the opportunity to start working with

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
cannabis

87
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,479
clients i just never i never learned

88
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,359
back and so

89
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,280
um

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
what i'm focusing on right now is really

91
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,318
the issue that we're going to talk about

92
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,120
as a group today

93
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,399

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200

leave it at that awesome thanks daniela

96
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,518
hello everybody i'm daniel hendricks um

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,680
i was

98
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,560
born in my backyard in humboldt county

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,519
to two humble undergraduate students and

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,560
i feel like symbolically i've always

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,239
followed the plant it was 1996 when the

102
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,878
compassionate care act passed i was a

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,640
freshman in high school and i knew that

104
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,518
was something that i really wanted to

105
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,318
pursue i saw a change in politics and

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,480
the global view of cannabis and i

107
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,238
i hoped i could be part of that so we

108
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,318
founded hendricks farms

109
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,840
it's a nursery that focuses on

110
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:00,000
preservation and delivery of powerful

111
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,080
and endemic to humboldt county plants

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,840
and genetics for both home farmers and

113
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,000
commercial licenses

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,878
thanks daniel dale

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,199
yeah

116
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,120
my name is dale hunt i am a plant

117
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,039
scientist

118
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,799
did a bachelor's degree in botany

119
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,199
masters in genetics

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,759
phd in molecular and cellular biology

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,240
and then i went to law school

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,400
and i've been a patent attorney for 26

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,918
years

124
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,799
apologies to people who've heard this

125
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,399
before

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,918
i say it a lot but

127
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,918
it's kind of necessary i guess

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,240
as a patent attorney i've always worked

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,479
with plant breeders in addition to lots

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,319
of other kinds of inventors

131
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,560
and i've helped plant breeders protect

132
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,079
their inventions

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
all over the world i think something

134
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:50,319
like 30 countries and we've done

135
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,560
licensed deals in about 20 countries

136
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,159
i've seen firsthand how

137
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,319
companies that have valuable genetics

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,639
can scale globally on a really big scale

139
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,639
just by licensing others to grow their

140
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,079
to grow their plants

141
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,439
and

142
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,599
i know that this can be done in the

143
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,000
cannabis industry as world markets open

144
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,240
up

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,279
got into cannabis about eight years ago

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,160
as in a professional sense and um

147
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,319
uh

148
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,680
have really enjoyed working with plant

149
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,599
breeders one of the

150
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,879
my favorite things about my job is just

151
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
getting to know

152
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,319
the the independent

153
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,799
plant breeders that have been doing it

154
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,719
for decades and seeing their passion and

155
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
seeing their creative drive

156
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,520
and

157
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,039
the fact that they put

158
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,319
making better plants and better

159
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,639
medicines and helping people way above

160
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,159
even making a living

161
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,280
some of them are doing well and a lot of

162
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
them aren't

163
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,038
and as i started visiting breeders on

164
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
their farms

165
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:53,599
it went from being a really interesting

166
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,879
job to being a passion and a cause and

167
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
so

168
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,639
i started my company breeders best in

169
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,319
order to help

170
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,160
cannabis breeders that couldn't afford

171
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,560
to patent their own things

172
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,880
if we think that there's something that

173
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
really has some potential

174
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,399
then the company will pay for the

175
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,879
patenting

176
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,079
and in exchange receives an exclusive

177
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,839
license

178
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,120
and meanwhile the breeder always owns

179
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,198
the patent

180
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,959
and the license revenues that the

181
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,879
company generates

182
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,439
go back to

183
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,800
go back to the breeder after obviously

184
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,839
it's shared between the breeder and the

185
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,120
company

186
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,519
it is

187
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,519
a lot like a record label where the

188
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,879
breeder is a creative person making

189
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,959
something great

190
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,120
and they get to focus on their creative

191
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,279
work and they don't have to do all of

192
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,918
the other things that that lie between

193
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,519
the creation and the revenues that's the

194
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:46,639
job of the company

195
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,318
and um

196
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,360
it's a huge honor to have some members

197
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,680
of the breeder's best team here today um

198
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
they are uh

199
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,840
every bit as passionate as i am about

200
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,198
the plant and um

201
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,359
about the potential

202
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,478
for that we have to make a difference

203
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
so

204
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,639
um i'll stop there

205
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,879
i can go on

206
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,038
hey ron hey how's it going my name is

207
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,879
rob golightly and i'm i'm a lifelong

208
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,478
cannabis activist i started collecting

209
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,680
signatures for proposition 215 in 1993.

210
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,439
um

211
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
i've been growing cannabis and selling

212
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,360
it legally in california since

213
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,399
over-the-counter sales started around

214
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,720
2006 i've been aligned with

215
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,399
collectives that were licensed by the

216
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,560
city of los angeles since around the

217
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,839
same time and

218
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,598
have constantly grown

219
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,119
different medical strains out of humble

220
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,279
and breeded

221
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,280
legacy genetics from different elders

222
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,758
that i've been gifted seeds throughout

223
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,758
the years when people pass away and

224
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
certain things happen on genetics get

225
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,479
passed around and

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,918
i've also been a big nursery person too

227
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,240
before

228
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,878
prop 64 came so i was doing a lot of

229
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
clones and humble also and you know

230
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,759
picking

231
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,719
specific varieties that would work for

232
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,560
good for

233
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,240
not just medical reasons but also for

234
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
commercial cultivation so that they

235
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,879
could grow large quantities of it at a

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,879
time

237
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,639
and we also you know i have a

238
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,240
distribution company legally now and i

239
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,319
also have a legal

240
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,879
ten thousand square foot farm in

241
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,400
honeydew california and that was one of

242
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,879
the first hundred to get licensed in

243
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,638
california

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,360
thanks rob great job

245
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,199
so my name is lelania dubois or a lot of

246
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,598
people know me is lele

247
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,000
and i'm a second generation cannabis

248
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,158
cultivator and community developer in

249
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,080
the emerald triangle i'm also the

250
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,038
founder of the humboldt grace legacy

251
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,278
project and cco of canopyright

252
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,759
the humboldt grace legacy project was

253
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,000
formed as a strategy to empower the

254
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,600
decades of knowledge around cannabis in

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,519
the emerald triangle

256
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,879
the people who hold this knowledge we

257
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,200
call legacy

258
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,439
our goal was to build a pathway forward

259
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,759
to preserve and validate the genetic

260
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,160
diversity of these communities

261
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,120
reinventing how the market values the

262
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,958
plant and the legacy experience

263
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,039
so today we're going to kind of talk

264
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,518
about what are some of the hurdles that

265
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,439
it that that's going on with the legacy

266
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,759
right now what are some of the solutions

267
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,560
and then why does it matter to people

268
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,319
who are involved in medicine and science

269
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,919
so to start you guys

270
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,000
why don't we talk about what some of the

271
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,759
hurdles we've all seen from our

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,360
different perspectives

273
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,799
jeff do you want to start i'm going to

274
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,800
sit down so i don't fall down

275
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,399
um sure i'm happy to start so i my

276
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,720
experience is completely different than

277
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,639
everyone well maybe not dale but

278
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,519
um i think for

279
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,439
for me working with cannabis clients

280
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,200
you always saw

281
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
two things on the jar right there's the

282
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,920
brand name and then there's the cultivar

283
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,639
name and it's always pretty clear to me

284
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,360
that the brands got paid that made sense

285
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,399
but

286
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,399
the cultivar what is that did the person

287
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,320
who invented it get paid do we even know

288
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,519
who they are could we find out

289
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,800
and so

290
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,360
um so this is a personal experience um

291
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,039
sort of with me and a particular client

292
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
but also several clients all with the

293
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,719
exact same problem well

294
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,959
my i've got all of these these cultivars

295
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,240
they're really like my most valuable

296
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,039
business asset

297
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,639
if i didn't have my my seed library i

298
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,919
wouldn't have gotten all this investment

299
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,958
money i wouldn't be able to build my

300
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,159
facility

301
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,439
so

302
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,799
i'm you know you're sitting there you're

303
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
having lunch with these clients and

304
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,120
you're this red light goes off in your

305
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,319
head well do you own your cultivars do

306
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,519
you like

307
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
what

308
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,120
can you even own your cultivars and so

309
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,159
i i ended up in this rabbit hole but you

310
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
but i guess

311
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,600
when i'm talking about the hurdles

312
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
facing the industry right now it's that

313
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,800
it's really hard to document

314
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,519
cultivars in a way that makes sense that

315
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,278
allows for the people that spent decades

316
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,919
developing those cultivars including

317
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,480
sort of the legacy community to get paid

318
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,479
from it it just didn't make sense to me

319
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,320
um and so i guess that's what i would

320
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,560
say is that the hurdle that i've seen

321
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,120
not being valued for their work not

322
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,599
being valued and not not even not being

323
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,000
valued but there not even being a way to

324
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
evaluate right right

325
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,039
daniel

326
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
anyone yeah there's there's lots of

327
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,078
hurdles

328
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,078
for the legacy

329
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,359
farmer i would say the biggest hurdle

330
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,319
they have is

331
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,399
getting their product to the consumer

332
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,360
there are several supply chain pieces

333
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,639
that

334
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,000
being removed in a remote location

335
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,000
up in the hills

336
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,278
working with environmentally friendly

337
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
practices

338
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,958
you have a really long supply chain

339
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,278
visit to get us down to la

340
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,319
so because of that

341
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,078
they're dependent on the distribution

342
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,480
networks to

343
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,599
sell their product to the farmer to the

344
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
distribution company that's going to

345
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,519
white label it and create something for

346
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,919
the retail customer

347
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,959
and to simplify their jobs

348
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,799
the distribution companies focus on

349
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,159
singular

350
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:14,719
metric points they want high thc

351
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,679
they want purple they want certain

352
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,800
specific lead terpenes and so

353
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,838
i see it is really challenging

354
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,639
to

355
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,800
motivate yourself to preserve diversity

356
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,120
in the cannabis gene pool right now

357
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,199
because in order to make a living you're

358
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,000
forced to kind of follow

359
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,480
the pathways that you're given and

360
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
not being vertically integrated

361
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
puts a lot of humble farmers at a

362
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,399
disadvantage and i feel like it puts the

363
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,639
consumer at a disadvantage specifically

364
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,480
the medical patients and actually

365
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,240
reaching the diversity and the different

366
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,959
effects that they want um so i i do see

367
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,720
that access point being a really big

368
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,958
challenge i would love to see um

369
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,240
e-commerce and direct-to-consumer

370
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,159
opportunities

371
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,240
develop for the

372
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,078
legacy farmers and i

373
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
i like i'll just insert the word

374
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,719
heirloom because there's something that

375
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,720
i feel like legacy might not even

376
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,680
communicate what we're doing here which

377
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,278
is

378
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,799
heirloom and

379
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,799
if you guys go to the grocery store

380
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,159
you'll probably see heirloom tomatoes

381
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,639
that cost more and maybe have a better

382
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,919
flavor profile different than your

383
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,519
commercially bought tomatoes and so

384
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,278
we're at the very beginning here in

385
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,759
cannabis where we're trying to hold on

386
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,278
to those heirlooms and we see the

387
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,360
agricultural

388
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,958
tools that are coming in and the mono

389
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,680
cropping that's coming in

390
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,439
is going to create a period where

391
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,078
the consumer isn't going to have access

392
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,600
to these heirlooms unless they go and

393
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,559
value it

394
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,920
and with that big separation in between

395
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,879
the farmers that have preserved these

396
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,958
heirlooms and the consumer that

397
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,039
maybe doesn't know how the different

398
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,958
effects could be curated from these

399
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,319
different profiles there's just a

400
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,399
disconnect there and it would be really

401
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,720
nice to see the farmers and the

402
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,679
consumers interact again

403
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,160
like actually you know sadly before prop

404
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,599
64 when people were kind of able to work

405
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,759
directly with

406
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,639
the grower to get exactly what they want

407
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,319
so

408
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
that's one of the hurdles that i see is

409
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,839
just reaching the consumer

410
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,159
well in the science like with dr

411
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,000
sicily's research right everyone someone

412
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,439
mentioned it yesterday

413
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,198
how

414
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,480
the research said that you know cannabis

415
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,559
doesn't really work that well but she

416
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,560
didn't really have access

417
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,319
to high quality medicine right

418
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,719
absolutely in our community she was like

419
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,720
i wish i could study it here yeah yeah

420
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,720
sue sicily she's a great example because

421
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,480
she's so tough um

422
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,160
in her nature and refuses to

423
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,639
follow that path of these kind of

424
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,039
you know not diluted but whatever the

425
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,959
dea has in their library which doesn't

426
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,879
reflect the diversity

427
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,000
that you know people want to interact

428
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,958
with when they want to interact with the

429
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
plant so good for her for

430
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,078
sticking to that point and kind of

431
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,600
refusing to

432
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,198
do another study that's really just

433
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
going to invalidate the truth

434
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,039
dale rob do you have anything to add to

435
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,799
hurdles i know you do rob well it was

436
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,360
pretty amazing when sue was in humble

437
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,120
and she recognized our legacy genetics i

438
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,600
was there with you a few years ago and

439
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,360
she really did

440
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,759
recognize that we are sitting on better

441
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,839
medicine to be running tests and trials

442
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,958
of with the veterans um that's really

443
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,120
exciting

444
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,078
but i for a legacy farmer for someone

445
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,679
entering the metric right now um and say

446
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,198
you were able to pay all the bills and

447
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,599
pass all the stipulations of the

448
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,120
regulatory process um the biggest

449
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,399
problem for a burrito right now is

450
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,799
they're not allowed allowing new

451
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,278
genetics into the metric in california

452
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,198
and so um right now the big buzzword

453
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,759
with the dcc was having public comments

454
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,039
just a few weeks ago and a lot of people

455
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,079
are upset because they can't get their

456
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,078
genetics into metric and so

457
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,919
yeah we're pretty much locked out right

458
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,838
now in california and also right now in

459
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,479
california we've reached a point where

460
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,880
70 of all the genetics in the metric

461
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,240
right now are related to each other

462
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,639
and so

463
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,120
like daniel was saying just a second ago

464
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,600
i go to the collectives every week to we

465
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,320
dispense to probably close to 70

466
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,199
collectives and the medical selections

467
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,480
for diversity of genetics is

468
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:28,000
is disgusting it's no longer a medical i

469
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,079
don't consider it medical marijuana

470
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,360
anymore it's become wrecked marijuana

471
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,359
and um

472
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,039
you know as we lose

473
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,440
the different gene pools it'll just

474
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,360
becoming more and more wreck

475
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,240
and you know speaking to the trends of

476
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,839
it too

477
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,639
we've watched this purple thing get

478
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,480
really trendy where og was the old trend

479
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,120
um and we're already seeing the purple

480
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,720
trend fade and we're seeing the og trend

481
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,000
is about to come back in the next few

482
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,399
months and it's just wild how the market

483
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,799
can be dictated by

484
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,759
rappers and fancy

485
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,758
you know commercials

486
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:04,639
i just

487
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,399
there's one other thing that i think

488
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,640
it's been a problem for the last few

489
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,559
years uh but it's

490
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,799
i think it's still pretty significant

491
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,160
and that is just the issue of trust

492
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,838
um

493
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,720
in the old school communities i think

494
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,399
people and i wasn't part of them so i

495
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,400
can't pretend to speak for them but my

496
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,079
observation is that they knew who they

497
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,280
could trust they trusted their neighbors

498
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,359
they trusted

499
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,720
um people in their community

500
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,719
and they knew not to trust the

501
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,798
government and they knew they didn't

502
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,000
want to deal with lawyers

503
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,200
they didn't want to deal with big

504
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
companies

505
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,319
and uh

506
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,280
things have gotten really complicated

507
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,359
because

508
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,720
oh and they knew not to to

509
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,639
you know

510
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,798
interact they didn't interact much with

511
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,480
science and technology companies

512
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,558
somewhat but not a lot

513
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,279
and things have really gotten shaken up

514
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,279
because now

515
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,798
i've heard plenty of stories from

516
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,000
breeders that have said yeah i gave my

517
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:58,798
friend

518
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,480
this

519
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,599
this particular selection to put in his

520
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,519
catalog

521
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,439
and i never got paid

522
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,558
i've seen that a lot i've seen that even

523
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
recently

524
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,839
uh people just not getting paid they

525
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
think they can trust somebody and then

526
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,678
they can't

527
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,480
and then even more distasteful they

528
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,120
might have to somehow trust a lawyer or

529
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,200
trust the government to get a patent

530
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,719
and to just engage parties they never

531
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,759
wanted to engage and to start

532
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,200
questioning

533
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,440
it really is hard to figure out who you

534
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,480
can trust in this industry

535
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,880
um

536
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,640
and it i i like to use the word

537
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,120
community but i think it has as its

538
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,440
transition from community to industry

539
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,279
uh it's gotten very confusing i don't

540
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,200
know sir that i have any great solutions

541
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,200
for that but um

542
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,880
uh you know there are

543
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,558
lawyers and and companies that are

544
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,360
trying to be trustworthy but you can't

545
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,960
just

546
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,678
somebody tells you oh you should trust

547
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
me

548
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,720
you probably shouldn't

549
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,199
you got to watch watch them walk the

550
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,160
walk but you can trust me when i say

551
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,160
trust dale

552
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,079
or when we ask dale why we shouldn't

553
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,720
trust him and then he answers us in

554
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,279
front of a bunch of other people

555
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,160
just to preface how i view both of these

556
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,480
attorneys i think the word activist is

557
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,880
synonymous with lawyer when i picture

558
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,160
their identities and i think that's an

559
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,480
important com component that um there's

560
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,200
there's an element of activism

561
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,038
in genetic preservation in cannabis

562
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,080
right now because there isn't money in

563
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,079
it we'll tell you that much

564
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,519
i want to add one more thing to the

565
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,600
hurdles

566
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,839
where's the money in cannabis at

567
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,480
good question is anybody in here making

568
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,480
no ask the lawyers

569
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,679
i think it's in the government

570
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,120
right they definitely got the taxes yeah

571
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,120
i want to add one more thing to their

572
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,279
hurdles and i think that's education you

573
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,239
know we're talking about genetics and

574
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,000
and

575
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,558
one of the things that i see as we're

576
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,160
building new products and and

577
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,240
creating all these new things out of

578
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,759
this plant when we're talking about like

579
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,400
consumer

580
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:05,359
loyalty and when we're talking about

581
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,798
healing people i'm a patient i have no

582
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:11,199
l4 l5 and a torn spinal cord and i

583
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:15,038
really have to understand my medicine to

584
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,120
be functionable and genetics are really

585
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,038
important in that conversation when

586
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,879
you're trying to heal somebody or when

587
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,038
you're trying to make

588
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,400
a joint that makes people feel a certain

589
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,558
way and and and the gap in that is huge

590
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,400
yet these legacy communities literally

591
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,678
have we know people who have been

592
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,960
working with this plant for six

593
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,880
generations

594
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,960
and so bringing those two together i

595
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,720
think is going to help create a lot more

596
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,720
real medicine too

597
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,279
and and

598
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,919
push the research forward

599
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:48,960
um in that so learning

600
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,240
why all this diversity matters

601
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,558
so

602
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,519
how about solutions

603
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:58,000
solutions um

604
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,200
somebody else these guys jeffrey has a

605
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,599
solution

606
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,679
i am um you know believe business

607
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,798
and solution you would have to be an

608
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,400
activist

609
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,879
in your business to try to create

610
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,640
solutions i'm more on the ground i'm

611
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,760
caught in the fight i think

612
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,880
what jeff created shows a really good

613
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,038
perspective on potential solutions um

614
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,480
because protecting your varieties

615
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,960
you know somebody holds something that's

616
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,679
very special and has unique cannabinoid

617
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,480
profiles that they've worked on for 25

618
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,280
generations of the plants breeding so

619
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,480
maybe that's 25 years maybe that's 15

620
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,480
years but extensive work and it's really

621
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,440
life's work that people pour into these

622
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
things

623
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,480
so

624
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,480
you pour your life's work into something

625
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,120
and then you find yourself outside of

626
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,000
the commercial sphere you have to ask

627
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:52,239
yourself how am i going to get this

628
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,599
valuable medicine to somebody and how do

629
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,400
i do that

630
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,399
you know

631
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,679
there's an element of trust that you

632
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,559
have to have a partner that you do trust

633
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
um

634
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,079
and i think that

635
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,038
people are looking for answers because

636
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,798
they

637
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,960
are probably evolved now to the point

638
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,319
where the right contract or the right

639
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,880
agreements

640
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,639
probably look pretty enticing in terms

641
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,600
of a way to get their medicine to reach

642
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,038
people

643
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,599
and

644
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,240
dale and jeff have both presented

645
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:24,558
solutions that you know i'd never

646
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,079
considered before you know you won't let

647
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,359
you guys talk about your agreements and

648
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:32,639
your software but really exciting

649
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,959
yeah um yeah well i mean

650
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,679
i wouldn't be sitting here if i wouldn't

651
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,200
have ran into met dale and then youth

652
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,038
came to me because

653
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
we have all these amazing people in our

654
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,480
community and i'm really a community

655
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,000
builder but there was no way to go to

656
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,679
folks and say well you're protected

657
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,440
especially people like what daniel's

658
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,919
saying that are shut out of the market

659
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,960
we have a lot of breeders with i know

660
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,559
one breeder in particular who has over 4

661
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,279
000 different cultivars that he's been

662
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,440
seed hunting for 60 years and that's

663
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,839
just one person

664
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,080
yet he has no income

665
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,359
and jeff came and said i think i have a

666
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,678
solution

667
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,759
and it's this blockchain but

668
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,798
and he said something that was also

669
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,798
unique that i want the community's help

670
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,879
i want the breeders to help me make this

671
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,359
so it really works for him and that's

672
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
how we got started on understanding that

673
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,000
there was a solution that we could start

674
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:31,038
building off of out there

675
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,319
um cool should i start talking now

676
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,000
all right

677
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,519
um so

678
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
in thinking about

679
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,839
how

680
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,240
cannabis genetic diversity works i've

681
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,558
i've always thought about

682
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,000
um comparing it to music and how the

683
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,000
music industry works

684
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,119
um and so

685
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,480
when when you think about what a

686
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,038
cannabis breeder does when they're

687
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,558
developing strains it's it's really art

688
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,519
and that cannabis strain is really a

689
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,599
work of art and if we could figure out a

690
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,158
mechanism for cannabis breeders to get

691
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,798
paid for the commercialization of their

692
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,200
cultivars like artists get paid for

693
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:10,319
their art then maybe we could create a

694
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,798
fairer system that resulted in sort of a

695
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,119
more equitable distribution of the

696
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,200
profits from this industry but also

697
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,959
gives people an opportunity to protect

698
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,600
their work that they've spent decades

699
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,440
building so

700
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,798
what we come up with what we came up

701
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,880
with was

702
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,720
a system for doing that

703
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,360
and we've been working with the humboldt

704
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,759
grace legacy

705
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,000
calls project

706
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,500
every friday at 11. i did your pleasure

707
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,599
anyone can come and anyone can come

708
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,880
[Music]

709
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,719
so the

710
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,278
the main mechanism

711
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,440
is to define a cannabis cultivar as

712
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:48,720
in original work if you have something

713
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,919
that you think that you want to

714
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,759
commercialize

715
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,400
you can take a cutting of fresh leaf

716
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:57,440
material you can stick it in a tamper

717
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,360
evident package with a qr code and then

718
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,278
you can close the tamper evident package

719
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,519
take a photo of your sample and you can

720
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,119
keep it in your own freezer so

721
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,079
if you think that somebody ripped you

722
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,558
off you can open up your freezer you can

723
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:13,599
send your sample to mike at medicinal

724
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,440
genomics and you can sort of

725
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,480
determine whether or not you got ripped

726
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,120
off

727
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,720
but the value of having your frozen

728
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,319
sample is

729
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,960
and the value of how we're building it

730
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,798
through blockchain is that you can you

731
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,880
can build out a profile for your

732
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,558
cultivar and then if you want to enter

733
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,039
into a licensing agreement it's pretty

734
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,720
simple to do so

735
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,319
when you think about how the track and

736
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,960
trace system works

737
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,480
you have to put a little tag on every

738
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,480
single flowering plant in the legal

739
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,679
market and it's you know it's bad for

740
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,440
the environment but it's good for

741
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,038
inventory control and the fact that the

742
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,759
state is making you do it regardless um

743
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:54,000
really presents an opportunity to

744
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,480
to take this example of

745
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,240
licensing cannabis genetics like music

746
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,038
to another level so

747
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,278
if you think about a cannabis breeder as

748
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,759
an artist and a cannabis strain like a

749
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,319
song and a cannabis plant like the

750
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,278
equivalent of the play of a song

751
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:13,038
roughly the same functionality of music

752
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,079
streaming services can be applied to

753
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,720
cannabis

754
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,158
um and so that's what we're that's what

755
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,159
we're building

756
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,278
we're working with the legacy project

757
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,200
and

758
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,119
that's my story

759
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,679
in the legacy project we released a

760
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,000
white paper i guess a couple weeks ago

761
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,200
and and what we're taking is all this

762
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,159
information

763
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,278
to show folks how they can not just

764
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,840
secure or protect but how they can also

765
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,919
validate and authenticate their work and

766
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:45,439
then we're going to have an auction in

767
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,278
november to really educate not just on

768
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,320
the hype but like

769
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:49,679
show

770
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,678
i like to say we're going to show

771
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,000
everybody's panties because instead of

772
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,679
saying that we're the best it's going to

773
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,839
be you're going to look at this and

774
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,640
you're going to tell us what you think

775
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,519
through

776
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,520
the chemical profiles through the dna

777
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,558
through the stories that the breeders

778
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,599
give so we can start

779
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:12,158
helping folks we look at this plant a

780
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,639
little differently and maybe

781
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,559
empower the market to come to our

782
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,120
communities instead of asking for how

783
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,960
much weed they have we can

784
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,119
they'll ask oh

785
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,798
i want a joint that gives me this kind

786
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,879
of experience or i really need a strain

787
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,639
that's high in thcv

788
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,080
and because of what these communities

789
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,240
have been doing so for so many

790
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,480
generations we already know this is

791
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,880
going on we just have to bridge the gap

792
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,798
in that conversation

793
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,720
dale so

794
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:47,038
why does this matter to doctors we're

795
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,640
just doctors i love being here it's so

796
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,440
exciting to be a part of a science

797
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,120
conference but why why

798
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,679
why should they listen why should they

799
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,879
want to talk to folks that are involved

800
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,720
or that are from the legacy experience

801
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,080
i'm tempted to

802
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,880
turn about something that happened

803
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,319
yesterday i was watching

804
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,480
my friends back there at the middle

805
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,480
table doing a podcast

806
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,839
and they dragged me onto it to

807
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,519
participate with them these are the

808
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,759
breeders best folks

809
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,359
nisha whiteley ethan rousseau and mojave

810
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,119
richmond

811
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,519
ethan would be the very best person to

812
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,519
answer that mojave would also give a

813
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,000
great answer anisha wrote a book on this

814
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,000
stuff so

815
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,319
but i'll try to speak for them and then

816
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,079
i might hear about it if i get it wrong

817
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,798
but basically

818
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,278
cannabis is a rich rich source of

819
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,319
biochemical diversity

820
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,398
of different molecules that contact the

821
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,079
most widely distributed

822
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,038
receptor system in the body and it

823
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,839
affects

824
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,960
pretty much every function of the body

825
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,720
and

826
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,558
given that that's kind of the if you

827
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,759
think of that as the infrastructure for

828
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,440
signaling with medicines to get the body

829
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,839
to fix itself or to do something

830
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,840
differently

831
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,278
then you've got the plant makes the

832
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,558
tools to interact with this

833
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,000
infrastructure

834
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,480
and to

835
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,558
address all kinds of problems and the

836
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,278
the real beauty of that is

837
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,759
to use the term that uh that dr russo i

838
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,000
believe coined and and is very fond of

839
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,000
it is the entourage effect which i

840
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,480
describe i just think of it as synergy

841
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,159
between the interactions of one thing

842
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,240
touching a receptor and something else

843
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,399
touching a different receptor or

844
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,440
interacting with the same receptor you

845
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:32,000
get

846
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,320
really different and sometimes extremely

847
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,960
elevated activities at the receptor

848
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,319
level because of of the interaction of

849
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,640
more than one molecule and i think

850
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:43,200
that's the weakness of single molecule

851
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,880
drugs they don't allow for any synergy

852
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,278
but as soon as you have

853
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,960
a whole plant medicine or an extract

854
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,038
from a plant and you've got lots of

855
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,440
different things that can interact with

856
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,440
that receptor system in a synergistic

857
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,038
way in a cooperative way then you've got

858
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,320
the potential for incredibly more

859
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,960
powerful medicines at lower doses

860
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,599
so i think that's that's why

861
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,079
doctors should be interested in genetic

862
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,599
diversity in cannabis because if

863
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,918
everything you've got out there has the

864
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,158
same two or three terpenes in the same

865
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,679
one or two or three cannabinoids then

866
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,600
you're limiting yourself

867
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,720
and you're it's like you walk into a

868
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,480
library

869
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,919
and you stop at the first shelf and you

870
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,519
pull off the first couple books and you

871
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,720
walk back out

872
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,599
that's that's a a huge um

873
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,480
uh

874
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,359
under utilization of this vast potential

875
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,159
so

876
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,639
i i think that the genetic diversity the

877
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,640
biochemical diversity and the potential

878
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,480
that we have to

879
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,278
with with the help of the great legacy

880
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,000
breeders as well as uh

881
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,519
molecular technologies to develop plants

882
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,038
that really can

883
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,278
uh provide

884
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,919
new and extremely powerful medicines

885
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,278
that are extremely safe is a promise

886
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,480
that is going to revolutionize the

887
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,480
health of everybody on earth

888
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,480
well said

889
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,079
ethan might be smiling under his mask he

890
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,079
might be drowning

891
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,840
yeah the different varieties i think are

892
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,398
really important and evaluating your

893
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,918
medicine based on the effects

894
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,959
i think is something that's just totally

895
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,559
underutilized right now i don't know if

896
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,278
the consumer

897
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,278
really responds to okay either i'm high

898
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,960
or i'm not high that's a very like

899
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:38,720
binary vision of cannabis and that if

900
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,798
you drink a glass of wine versus a glass

901
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,360
of beer versus a margarita or a shot of

902
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,918
tequila you're gonna feel different

903
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,558
based on those inputs and cannabis has

904
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,840
an even wider range of effects that it

905
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:55,519
can have and so just to touch on a few

906
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:58,558
ringo's gift high cbd cultivar nearly

907
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,720
unmarketable in the commercial market

908
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,319
there are mothers that say they've heard

909
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,640
their children say mom for the first

910
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,798
time in three years by

911
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,600
utilizing the plant

912
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:11,440
we will do anything to make that person

913
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,599
feel better whether there's money

914
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,320
involved or not uh

915
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,480
blue skunk and orange cream frost two

916
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,798
cultivars one bread for ptsd the blue

917
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,720
skunk orange cream frost bread for its

918
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:25,200
beauty and its aroma

919
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,000
the orange cream frost will level you it

920
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
will

921
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,679
shut you down you will stop talking

922
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,678
you'll go inside your head and the blue

923
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,840
skunk will make you on a day where

924
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,759
you're just having a bad day blow off

925
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,918
the thing that really doesn't matter the

926
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,398
distressing you out so we went to a

927
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,559
podcast and the breeder brought these

928
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,479
two herbs and the order

929
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,879
was that they were the podcast

930
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,798
interviewers were going to smoke the two

931
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,399
strains and talk about it they smoked

932
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:51,679
the blue skunk we had a great interview

933
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:54,319
and then they smoked the orange cream

934
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,399
frost and he went catatonic he did not

935
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,879
say one thing until the sound engineer

936
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,239
just shut it down okay it's over um

937
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,240
that's the power

938
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,399
of those genetics and if you choose the

939
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,319
really purple flashy one you might get

940
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:07,918
leveled when you really want the bright

941
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,759
green one that's going to make you feel

942
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,080
really good for the day

943
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,879
and then to touch on one more and the

944
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,639
cannabinoids and the minor cannabinoids

945
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,278
is pink boost goddess

946
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,720
where it is documented as the highest

947
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:22,720
thcv so

948
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:28,319
tetrahydrocannabirin i got that right um

949
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,678
that is a rare cannabinoid that some

950
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,839
labs can't even distinguish between thc

951
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,640
and thcv so

952
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,158
we might be missing the whole point when

953
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,320
we look at oh this thing's got twenty

954
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,440
two percent it might have

955
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:46,639
ten percent and seven percent tcv and

956
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,240
two percent thcp which is

957
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,278
on there are still undiscovered

958
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,640
cannabinoids here so the diversity and

959
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,200
the preservation

960
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,278
and is super important and the doctors

961
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,919
should be looking at the necessity of

962
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:02,398
that we need a data bank where we're a

963
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,399
bank where all these genetics exist and

964
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,798
we should be inviting the home growers

965
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:09,118
to pull all the seeds out of their

966
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,519
you know forbidden closets and preserve

967
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,519
these things and i will go further to

968
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,000
say it shouldn't be any government

969
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,679
entity that holds those data banks it

970
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,639
should be the community

971
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,639
that holds them here

972
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,479
rob you got you know

973
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,960
following up with dan

974
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,358
the the cannabis plant is the only plant

975
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,039
on earth that holds every single terpene

976
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,039
profile on earth

977
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,119
and so i think that there's a huge

978
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,719
research to do with just the variances

979
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,720
of all the different terpenes that are

980
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,480
out there and definitely

981
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,878
you know we're gonna find terpenes that

982
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,039
are might only have a hundred seeds left

983
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,878
that represent that terpene profile at

984
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,079
somebody's house that was growing at 50

985
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,279
years ago and

986
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,240
definitely

987
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,480
locking our data into blockchain is

988
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,399
a way to preserve this quickly it's it's

989
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,320
something that i had a friend that's

990
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,880
been doing nfts for almost four years

991
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,640
now and he was you know telling me that

992
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
i should try to find out something that

993
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,159
can connect with cannabis and it was

994
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,838
easily the first thing i figured out was

995
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,279
we could lock our dna codes into the

996
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,799
blockchain so that we can't get them

997
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,960
stolen and we can claim them so no one

998
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,880
else can ever claim them

999
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,559
and then second i had the idea that if

1000
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,400
we could create contracts just for

1001
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,199
selling cannabis so that we could

1002
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,720
control circumvention in the metric and

1003
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:25,759
create contracts that we could read the

1004
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,838
metric

1005
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,720
and sure enough somebody in our group

1006
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,239
created a smart contract before i could

1007
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,399
get a hold of my code or friend to tell

1008
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,199
him to do it and we have a contract that

1009
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,680
can read metric which i think is is

1010
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,000
really invaluable to

1011
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,399
um small cultivators to make sure that

1012
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,920
we can watch and track where our things

1013
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,039
are and make sure people don't steal

1014
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,680
them and

1015
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,679
take them awry

1016
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,959
all right thanks you guys does anyone

1017
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,838
have any questions of anybody on the

1018
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,838
panel up here

1019
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,519
hey eric

1020
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,719
there's a mic

1021
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,440
then they can record it i think yeah do

1022
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,440
the mic

1023
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,720
hi guys um thanks for being down here um

1024
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,800
my question is i was wondering if you

1025
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,118
could actually just run through what

1026
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,880
the the com the parts of a transaction

1027
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,400
like what that would look like like

1028
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,800
somebody

1029
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,280
sees a cultivar they're interested

1030
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,039
a client so how does that could you just

1031
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,040
sort of go through a

1032
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,719
an analogy of what that

1033
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,480
looks like in the different pieces how

1034
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,480
that comes together in how it's

1035
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,400
happening now or through canopy right

1036
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,159
what we've developed well through your

1037
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,240
um i guess it's still in beta so i don't

1038
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,000
think it's operating at this point but

1039
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,358
when it does launch

1040
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,679
what would that

1041
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,119
how would that look whether

1042
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,319
like somebody licensing what would that

1043
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:04,160
look like canopy right is the the engine

1044
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,000
is built and now the the the 2.0 design

1045
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,078
is coming out thanks to kelsey so it's

1046
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,599
really user friendly but do you want to

1047
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,640
answer that josh

1048
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,559
uh yeah i'll i'll answer that um

1049
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,559
so

1050
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,480
the way that it works isn't dissimilar

1051
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:22,078
so it's similar to how it works now

1052
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,920
except for one important change

1053
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,440
so

1054
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,119
the way that it works is if a grower

1055
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,519
wants to grow a cultivar from a breeder

1056
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,960
we have them negotiate a price on a per

1057
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,320
plant basis

1058
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,320
and

1059
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,640
once there's an agreement and there's a

1060
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,119
there's a mechanism for negotiation

1061
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,039
um the negotiation follows a few

1062
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,519
different paths so

1063
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,519
one is the price per plant again we

1064
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,838
invoice based on the flowering plant

1065
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,800
tags that are on each plant when they go

1066
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:52,799
in when they're entered into the

1067
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,880
traction tray system but that's really

1068
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,720
only one aspect of a transaction right

1069
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,039
because you're not just buying

1070
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,039
a plant you're also buying how you grow

1071
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,119
that plant and so

1072
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,519
we sort of create a space for people to

1073
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,720
input cultivation requirements quality

1074
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,519
standards

1075
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,559
um

1076
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,239
late fees sort of it's not just what

1077
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,159
you're charging per plan it's what

1078
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,159
you're charging per plant to get the

1079
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,399
cultivar that the breeder wants to be in

1080
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:21,279
the market

1081
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,000
but once that happens it's

1082
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,320
the

1083
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,079
when the cultivar's flowering plants are

1084
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,599
entered into the track and trace system

1085
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,599
we pull that

1086
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,880
data and then we generate an invoice

1087
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,838
based on the agreed upon price per plan

1088
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,280
we

1089
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:36,960
are tracking it

1090
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,680
you know periodically and then we

1091
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,960
invoice on a monthly basis

1092
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:44,239
that's the basic mechanism but i think

1093
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,760
it probably helps to talk about the

1094
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,838
privacy aspects of it because i think

1095
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,240
that that's

1096
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,239
you know a thing that is a problem in

1097
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:55,439
the industry right now is if you

1098
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,598
there's a lot of trust issues and also

1099
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,760
there's a lot of experience

1100
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,760
i know rob was talking about it

1101
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,280
but like everyone has a story of how

1102
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,880
they've been ripped off and so we want

1103
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,880
to just create a system that is

1104
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,200
completely private if users want it to

1105
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,720
be private

1106
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,639
and if i could just i am often asked

1107
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,719
about the difference between canopy

1108
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,319
right and patents and i i think it's

1109
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,159
it's helpful to

1110
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,559
explain the two because i think they're

1111
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,159
really compatible and i am a big

1112
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:27,039
supporter of canopy ride even though i'm

1113
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:29,279
a patent attorney so

1114
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,039
one of the things people ask me is is my

1115
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,640
plant new enough to patent is it

1116
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,639
different enough that i can get a patent

1117
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,400
on it and the answer is if you bread it

1118
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,400
it is different enough it'll qualify for

1119
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,079
a patent we can get you a patent the

1120
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,320
real question that you should be asking

1121
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,560
instead is is this plant worth patenting

1122
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,119
because there's no super inexpensive way

1123
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,400
to patent it it's going to cost you

1124
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,079
by the time you're finished it's going

1125
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,320
to cost at least ten thousand dollars

1126
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,480
and maybe up maybe a closer to thirty

1127
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,599
thousand dollars to get it patented now

1128
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,519
if you've got something that's going to

1129
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,599
take the world by storm and it'll be

1130
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,838
commercially viable for for a decade or

1131
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,519
two then that's just that that's just a

1132
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,119
rounding error on the rounding errors

1133
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,358
it's not going to be a significant

1134
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,480
amount of the value of that plan but

1135
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:10,559
there are a lot of things that people

1136
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,400
want to be able to commercialize without

1137
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,838
hiring a lawyer without spending that

1138
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,079
kind of money and with extremely quick

1139
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:21,279
efficient transactions and that's what i

1140
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,280
love about canopy right it lets people

1141
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,599
skip the whole lawyer thing

1142
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,200
and go straight into into commercial

1143
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,680
transactions

1144
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,118
and then canopyright notifies them that

1145
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,399
okay look as soon as you do a

1146
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,318
transaction

1147
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,079
you are starting a patent deadline for

1148
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,318
yourself you need to if you want to get

1149
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,039
a patent on this you need to act within

1150
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,119
a year and so these are not these are

1151
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,440
systems that i think are very compatible

1152
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,880
and it's a great solution for people who

1153
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,880
who don't want to spend the money on a

1154
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,640
patent and then another solution for

1155
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,079
people who don't want to spend the money

1156
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:56,239
on a patent as breeder's best because we

1157
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,560
pay for the patent work the breeder owns

1158
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:01,118
it but we have to be pretty selective we

1159
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,279
can't protect nearly as many cultivars

1160
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,039
as canopy right can handle because there

1161
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,880
is so much cost associated with it so

1162
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,880
it's only when we think we see something

1163
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,440
that we think we could put all over the

1164
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,640
world and really have an impact for a

1165
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,240
long time

1166
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,759
that that's when we say okay yeah we'll

1167
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,399
commit to this we'll spend the money on

1168
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,920
this and with confidence that it will

1169
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,920
end up producing enough revenues that

1170
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,760
the breeder can really benefit from it

1171
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,000
and that we can recoup our investment as

1172
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,440
well so they are they're different

1173
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,480
systems but i think they're highly

1174
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,838
compatible and it it opens up a form of

1175
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,639
protection to a lot more plant

1176
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:37,679
varieties

1177
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:40,159
um the last thing i would say is um just

1178
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,480
full disclosure um so we we the

1179
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,639
registration functionality we're not

1180
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,800
charging for and we will never charge

1181
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:47,838
for um it's just an essential service

1182
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,880
that we think that we're going to be

1183
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,480
providing

1184
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,519
so

1185
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,679
we're going to charge a royalty

1186
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,280
fee when people enter into business

1187
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,719
transactions with each other because we

1188
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,800
wrote your contract for you and i'm a

1189
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,759
lawyer that's what i do

1190
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,760
but i just we are trying to offer the

1191
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,160
system of you know creating a

1192
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,640
registration of a cultivar and we're

1193
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,239
trying to do it for free

1194
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:14,799
and just the model that they're

1195
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,799
discussing i mean our business has used

1196
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,920
that exact licensing model since its

1197
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,440
inception

1198
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,039
to economically empower breeders so

1199
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,559
things like the blueberry muffin and

1200
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,679
other varieties

1201
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,759
were curated with these concepts

1202
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,759
at the very beginning that we didn't

1203
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,440
want to share that without empowering

1204
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,839
the breeder and

1205
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,318
i think that it's a great first step to

1206
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,318
you know initiating asserting your value

1207
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,159
over your genetics is to put them into

1208
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,679
canopy right and say i'm going to take

1209
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,759
the first step to acknowledge the value

1210
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,000
here and i also want to say how cool it

1211
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,359
is that they use the temper

1212
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,599
proof

1213
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,199
the tampering proof bags which are

1214
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,680
kind of like an evidence

1215
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,598
police thing and i just think that's the

1216
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,838
irony there is really awesome

1217
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,280
it's a great design

1218
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,119
thanks

1219
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,040
yeah and and like daniel kind of

1220
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,838
mentioned the whole licensing agreement

1221
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,838
idea isn't a new concept it just wasn't

1222
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:14,159
very

1223
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:16,639
accessible and and what jeff has created

1224
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,358
is made it accessible so we can build on

1225
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:22,559
that hi evian hi i believe the gentleman

1226
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,559
over here had a question

1227
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,960
she had one too

1228
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,800
well i think she had a question maybe

1229
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,119
even before so

1230
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,200
come on i work with them so you could go

1231
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,720
ahead

1232
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:35,679
well thank you i apologize for being the

1233
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,639
last question

1234
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,639
um

1235
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:39,759
so i think that you all and the other

1236
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,400
talks this week have done a really good

1237
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,839
job of highlighting that um

1238
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,000
you know the the medical benefits of

1239
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,599
cannabis are probably really

1240
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,280
really come from having this diversity

1241
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,960
in the cultivars and having many

1242
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,319
terpenes and different profiles and even

1243
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,280
from the adult use perspective i think

1244
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:54,559
that's really important right in

1245
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,720
producing the different effects that the

1246
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,000
consumer might be looking for

1247
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,639
but right now there's this huge

1248
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,599
proliferation of synthetically derived

1249
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,118
cannabinoids like delta8 and hhc and and

1250
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,800
obviously those are being driven from a

1251
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,480
certain economic perspective and the

1252
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,318
fact that cannabis is illegal in many

1253
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,159
places so it's convenient to then gain

1254
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,599
access to something that will get you

1255
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,759
high or whatever

1256
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,519
but um i heard someone yesterday and

1257
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,200
effort at many other conferences that

1258
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,039
people think that um

1259
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:23,199
you know the biosynthetic derived from

1260
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,519
yeast or again these laboratory derived

1261
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,519
cannabinoids are perhaps a huge player

1262
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,759
in the future of the cannabis market but

1263
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,838
they seem to be pretty threatening to

1264
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,000
you know trying to maintain this

1265
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,838
diversity that is actually relevant to

1266
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,679
medicine and to again consumer

1267
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,440
satisfaction i think so i just wondered

1268
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:40,719
what all your thoughts are do do they

1269
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,358
really have a place in the future of

1270
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,959
cannabis um and if they do how does how

1271
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:47,759
does it all balance out so that we don't

1272
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,079
lose what you are all trying to preserve

1273
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,440
thank you great question anyone want to

1274
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,519
take that

1275
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,440
i mean my brief research into delta 8

1276
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,519
and the other cannabinoids definitely is

1277
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,440
because you know they're not letting you

1278
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,519
know thc across state borders we have

1279
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,880
plenty of thc to serve people across the

1280
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,719
country

1281
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,559
but i have seen that there's research

1282
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,838
that shows that it does do combinations

1283
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:12,480
with thc and people do get good effects

1284
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,719
from taking delta eight with th thc

1285
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,400
added and there's actually there's

1286
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,078
brands in the metric market in

1287
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,160
california now that have been adding

1288
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,920
delta eight in the last six to

1289
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,078
six months to a year that i've noticed

1290
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,838
coming out online so

1291
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,839
it's definitely been used in california

1292
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:30,318
even

1293
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:32,719
and from a patient's perspective

1294
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:34,000
you know i've always said whatever works

1295
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,159
but

1296
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
what i've learned over the years and

1297
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:39,920
i've watched us is we're getting closer

1298
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,719
and closer to morning i was raised by a

1299
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,880
midwife and and she was very much a

1300
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:49,358
naturopath in the way she she took care

1301
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:53,039
of her patients

1302
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:56,078
and i really i was a nurse and i really

1303
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:59,119
thought science knew everything and what

1304
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,920
i saw what i've seen the past two days

1305
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,079
is that science is starting to validate

1306
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,720
what indigenous studies indigenous

1307
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,800
medicines and plant medicines is known

1308
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,838
for centuries we just haven't had the

1309
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,079
tools to define those and i see science

1310
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,559
defining those things not really

1311
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,640
changing it so maybe this plant will

1312
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,279
help us realize that we don't need all

1313
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:23,118
those chemical things and that plant

1314
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,200
medicine might have a little more power

1315
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,480
than we've given it credit to

1316
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:31,919
[Music]

1317
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,920
[Applause]

1318
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,440
i would love to just uh hear if you

1319
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,599
could if the panel could speak to

1320
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,679
uh the work that the ethical data

1321
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,680
alliance has been doing for the past two

1322
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,159
and a half years and how all of these

1323
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,318
projects kind of tie together with that

1324
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,639
and the eden protocol with the

1325
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,318
blockchain and just how it's a kind of a

1326
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,400
gift back to the community and also the

1327
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:55,440
ethical gatekeeper of everything that

1328
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,200
we're doing

1329
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:02,159
well i just met the ethica data alliance

1330
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:05,279
about i don't know eight months ago

1331
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:08,639
but i'm very familiar with philos and

1332
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,440
all of that and dale actually

1333
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,960
dale and i ran uh i went to a meeting

1334
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,280
that dale was at and i was actually

1335
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,519
invited to meet dale about

1336
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,119
four years ago before covet and i said

1337
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,480
oh no i can't go there because my

1338
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,119
community won't trust me it's dale hutch

1339
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,679
and so i got invited to a small group

1340
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,680
meeting and i was able to ask him you

1341
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:32,639
know you seem great i appreciate what

1342
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:34,639
you have to say but why am i told that

1343
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,719
maybe you're the big bad devil trying to

1344
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:40,000
steal all our genetics and he gave me a

1345
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,679
really good answer and then he saw what

1346

some of us daniel and i have been

1347

1350
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,358

1369
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,118
these we think we have solutions

1370
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,000
and the ethica data alliance is really

1371
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,880
like

1372
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you know

1373
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,960
the mothership i i see them as the

1374
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,838
mothership helping this entire industry

1375
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:55,119
preserve and protect their ip through

1376
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:56,558
all these technologies and helping us

1377
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,240
through the humboldt grace legacy

1378
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,800
project because we're really about

1379
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:04,318
community and the plant

1380
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,480
ensure that we're doing the right thing

1381
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,558
through these technologies and and

1382
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,599
through our communities and so they're

1383
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,680
really

1384
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,880
a really great resource i think for

1385
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:18,078
anybody in the industry who is looking

1386
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,280
at innovative ways to use blockchain and

1387
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,760
crypto

1388
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,160
technologies to empower themselves and

1389
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,000
their communities in more ways than

1390
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,358
genetics

1391
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,159
it definitely is an amazing organization

1392
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:34,639
and we would not be where we are right

1393
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:37,118
now and this project is like going like

1394
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:40,318
wildflower locally we have a lot of

1395
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:43,039
support and i mean we would we just

1396
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,800
would not be here i would not know jeff

1397
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:47,119

1398
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,760

1400
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,920
please if you think you have ip

1401
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,838
that you need to preserve and protect

1402
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,358
go to their meetings because that's what

1403
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:00,799
they're doing

1404
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:02,719
anyone else want to add to that i mean

1405
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,720

1406
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,719
button on the website it's a non-profit

1407
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,279
we really we have one paid person on the

1408
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,838
eda and um

1409
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,920

1411
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,519

1412
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,480
greatly appreciated

1413
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,719
yeah the eda for me is the network that

1414
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,800
has brought us all together

1415
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,279
absolutely that i met dale

1416
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,519
in 2019 here at canmed after a really

1417
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,680
inspiring panel that he gave and i was

1418
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,000
fortunate enough to speak as well and we

1419
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:41,598
connected and the eda kept us together

1420
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,800
so ethical data alliance is my favorite

1421
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:47,119
group of cannabis nerds that care

1422
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,000
about the good guys and the little guys

1423
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:53,119
and it was formed in the wake of

1424
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
kind of some nefarious acts by

1425
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,680
you know a well-known cannabis dna

1426
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,519
sequence collecting company not

1427
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,519
medicinal genomics or leaf works

1428
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,358
i want to also add another reason that

1429
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,160
we're at this stage and here today is

1430
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,960
because of medicinal genomics

1431
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,879
brendan kevin and mike have been at our

1432
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,318
friday calls in fact i don't think

1433
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,880
they've missed

1434
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,719
one of our friday calls as medicinal

1435
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,240
genomics

1436

1437
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,838
