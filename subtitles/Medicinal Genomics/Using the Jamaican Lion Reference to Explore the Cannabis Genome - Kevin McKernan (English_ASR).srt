1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,019
we're gonna jump in to a different topic

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:09,179
here we're gonna change gears a little

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:11,609
bit and dive into genomics here so for

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,350
those who weren't here last year last

5
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:18,000
year we had the great joy of presenting

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,220
really one of the most complete cannabis

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,600
references completed to date now there

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,979
have been a lot of cannabis references

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,330
generated over the years and we've

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,189
generated some and many in this audience

11
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,948
have as well and they've been very

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,420
difficult to read mainly because of the

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,340
complexity of the genome it's very

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,929
polymorphic and it's very 8e rich so

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,489
when we finally got and assembly put

16
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:37,829
together with with Pacific Biosciences

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,659
it was really a joy of you know a day of

18
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,250
joy because we had not really seen what

19
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,529
all of these cannabinoid genes look like

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,058
in relationship to one another so today

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,859
we're gonna shift gears a little bit and

22
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,269
not talk about just that one reference

23
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,119
genome that we built but we're gonna

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,520
talk about 42 more of them that we've

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,640
since done since we started on this last

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,309
year so this was funded by a

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,899
cryptocurrency there's a talk that we

28
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,899
did last year describing how this was

29
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,239
done it was a five month grant that was

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,799
voted on by over 4,700 individuals

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,539
around the world to contribute some

32
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,420
cryptocurrency to this project is

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,360
actually sequence a cannabis genome and

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,849
this required about five months of

35
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,799
effort and in 60 days from being funded

36
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,618
we put the first assembly from Pacific

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,920
Biosciences up on the web at I think it

38
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,359
was a 600 and this like 60kb and 50 now

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,560
you're gonna hear a couple terms

40
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,569
throughout this talk about how you

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,269
monitor and assess the quality of

42
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,129
cannabis genomes and 50 is a measurement

43
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,509
of the average length of the context

44
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,920
sizes and you want these things to get

45
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,799
to be about the size of chromosomes

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,689
ideally that is rarely ever the case in

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,070
fact the first chromosome assembly for

48
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,289
the human genome just occurred last

49
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,349
month on I don't know one of the smaller

50
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,240
promos ohms and it's taken us like 19

51
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,589
years to figure that out because the

52
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,339
sequencing technologies really just

53
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,250
can't handle some parts of genomes so

54
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,469
this after we put this public we quickly

55
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,060
put up a preprint to get the data public

56
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,679
for everybody else after after the

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,840
August release and I think this one had

58
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,969
a even more contiguous assembly and that

59
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,860
n50 number was out to past three mega

60
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,810
bases now the other term you can hear us

61
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,680
talk about in terms of monitoring these

62
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,360
genomes

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,060
is a busco score which is an evaluation

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,860
of how many genes you should have in the

65
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,938
genome that are seen in all other plants

66
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,230
and if you're missing some of those

67
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:25,739
you'll probably have some completeness

68
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:28,738
issues okay so we were seeing these

69
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,599
genomes run up to a 97% busco score

70
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,980
which is a great in silica way to tell

71
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:34,348
you that your genomes getting close to

72
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:35,908
being done but really the the nail in

73
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:37,649
the coffin is when other people pick up

74
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:39,000
the data and measure it with different

75
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,980
techniques and come back with very

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
similar numbers and so I think there's

77
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,649
some probably members in the audience

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,989
that were involved in this wonderful

79
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,480
work on the proteome where they took

80
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,878
cannabis proteomes or measured them via

81
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,199
mass spec by doing a metabolite profile

82
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,818
and from there they were able to get

83
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,289
peptide signatures they could map to the

84
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:57,030
Jamaican lion reference and they were

85
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:58,560
low and behold finding that the Jamaican

86
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,870
lion reference produced the most number

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,780
of peptides that matched their proteome

88
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,549
data and then Reggie and his team with

89
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,019
Keith Allen at steep hill also grabbed

90
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:08,819
the Jamaican lion reference and then

91
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,349
annotated all of the terpene synthase

92
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:13,199
genes and recently published this paper

93
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:14,848
in PLoS about some unique features of

94
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,339
the terpene genes that we now know about

95
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:18,988
it so what's novel in the cannabis

96
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,090
genome is that many of the terpene

97
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,549
synthase genes have very long introns

98
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,989
this can be a problem if your assemblies

99
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:26,189
are somewhat fragmented because you

100
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:27,750
won't be able to piece these genes

101
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:30,419
together in the correct order or

102
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,669
orientation these are 55 in the terpene

103
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,319
synthase chains that they studied these

104
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,629
cover the monoterpenes assess quote

105
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,339
terpenes and i believe even some of the

106
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:40,378
diets were Keynes who are still digging

107
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,579
into the triterpene x' which we're gonna

108
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:43,739
touch on a little bit later in this

109
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:44,939
presentation but there's great work here

110
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,709
demonstrating that there is

111
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,509
co-occurrence or Co expression of

112
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,650
certain terpenes like human and

113
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:54,448
beta-carotene and they're probably

114
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,129
coming from the same genes okay so with

115
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,569
that said if you want to study the

116
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:58,768
terpene synthase genes you really have

117
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,208
to look at the chloroplast genomes

118
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,579
because half of the pathways inside the

119
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,769
plastic genome and to do that with

120
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,810
Pacific Biosciences sequencing you you

121
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,250
really need very high coverage and long

122
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,310
reads to do this

123
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,840
these this is a depiction here of what

124
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,280
looks like ten different chloroplast

125
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,560
genomes that are in the plant now we are

126
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,209
expecting to find one and now two of

127
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,839
these I think we can rule out that

128
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,978
they're actually nuclear genomes sorry

129
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,199
right there these are what are known as

130
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,819
nups there's a lot of transfer of DNA

131
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,709
from chloroplasts to the autism

132
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:30,449
and as a result you have to itemize

133
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,519
which ones are actually in the autosomes

134
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,839
and which ones are actually in the

135
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,519
organelles because the ones in the

136
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,399
autosomes are usually silence with

137
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,839
methylation so we do be doing a quick

138
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,429
scan on these to look at the depth of

139
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,349
coverage we have across those contexts

140
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,420
and then how much methylation is

141
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,560
actually present on those contexts so

142
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,900
that we can decide whether these are

143
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,089
organelle euro or silenced autosomal

144
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:54,299
copies of them but this does bring us

145
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,829
back to some questions about the nature

146
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,360
of chloroplast genomes we're always

147
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,009
taught in biology class that these

148
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,020
things are circular but the reality is

149
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,120
when you have sequencing capacity of

150
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:05,849
this power you capture these organelles

151
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,860
in the process of DNA replication live

152
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,720
and so you what you end up finding is

153
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,310
not just a perfect circular genome but a

154
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,540
bit of a Hydra where these when these

155
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,310
things are replicating there all of

156
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,870
these photo competent branches coming

157
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,550
off the circle that have certain

158
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,379
polymorphisms and then that we need to

159
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,689
keep track of the reason we're paying

160
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,550
close attention to chloroplast genetics

161
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,750
here is that if you look through a lot

162
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,520
of the genome engineering that's going

163
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,779
on in plants the vast majority of the

164
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,399
yield improvements are coming out of

165
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,369
modifying the photosynthesis pathways

166
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,169
moving things from c3 to c4

167
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,990
photosynthesis or modifying parts of

168
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,939
this of this genome those are seeing 50%

169
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,680
40% yield increases in a variety of

170
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,360
different organisms and so we really

171
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,949
have to understand the chloroplast

172
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,379
genome to get yield right and to get the

173
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:48,659
terpene synthases done correctly as well

174
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,100
and this gentleman Arnold been - had had

175
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,720
put out - a wonderful paper showing that

176
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,700
genomes really aren't circular when you

177
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,900
when you when you when you put them

178
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,920
under a microscope and we're seeing the

179
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,779
same thing with the single molecule

180
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,189
sequencing so how do we do the

181
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,419
methylation well this was done with New

182
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,519
England Biolabs now the thing about

183
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,530
cannabis is it's very hard to study its

184
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,029
methylation patterns because a lot of

185
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,439
the single the single molecule

186
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:08,609
sequencers out there aren't trained to

187
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,959
look for these methylation patterns

188
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,910
they're much more complex than human

189
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,439
methyl owns and so we're still resorting

190
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,750
to an older technique known as bisulfite

191
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,639
sequencing which converts the genome

192
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,290
anything that has a non methylated

193
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,060
cytosines it's converted to a thymine

194
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,100
alright so your genome then gets peeled

195
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,370
into two different genomes and it goes

196
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,560
from 66 percent 80 into 83 percent 80

197
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,329
this makes it really complicated to read

198
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,310
with short reads I think only about 50%

199
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:34,079
of the genomes mapable once you do this

200
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,850
but nevertheless you can still study

201
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,500
some of the genes and understand what's

202
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,300
going on with methylation so New England

203
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,000
Biolabs developed this methylation kit

204
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,340
that

205
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,290
is has less bias in the process of doing

206
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:46,539
this assessment and we deployed it on

207
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,210
five different tissues from the plant on

208
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,090
female flowers female seeded flowers

209
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:53,439
male flowers leaves and roots so that we

210
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:55,779
get an understanding of what's going on

211
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,310
throughout this process and the most

212
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:59,229
interesting thing that's that pops out

213
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,000
at you when you look at differential

214
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,370
methylation throughout the genome is

215
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,139
methylation in the Edisto gene so the

216
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,030
intestine gene is what makes the hemp

217
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:08,620
seeds so nutritious all right this is

218
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,359
the globular protein that gets made in

219
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,160
the hemp seed and if we want to feed the

220
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,990
world we need to understand how to hyper

221
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,250
express this protein well what's

222
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,600
interesting about the expression of this

223
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,459
protein is you can see that it is

224
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,129
differentially methylated in seeded

225
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:23,949
flowers versus female flowers and that

226
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:25,659
makes sense once the the female flowers

227
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:27,159
get seeded they start making seeds so

228
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,610
they turn the ax destined gene into high

229
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,650
gear

230
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,360
they hypo methylated take the

231
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,069
methylation signals off and let gene

232
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,689
expression occur when they want to shut

233
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,849
it down they methylated and this

234
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:38,139
silences transcription so we can see

235
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,280
these methylation patterns and they're

236
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,379
beginning to correlate with the

237
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,669
messenger RNA sequencing the other gene

238
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,980
you need to know about if you want to

239
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,990
feed the world is the THC gene alright

240
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,120
this is one that stimulates people to

241
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,889
eat particularly in cancer scenarios and

242
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,990
we can see similar methylation patterns

243
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,719
there where the male flowers have these

244
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,519
little red bars here and there those

245
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,590
things are effectively methylated and

246
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,959
shut down and the blue bars up here are

247
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,089
signifying bases in the genome that are

248
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,919
under methylated or unmethylated and so

249
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,479
transcription is turned on so we can

250
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,879
look at just the methylation signals on

251
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,439
the DNA to understand what genes might

252
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,180
be active and which ones are inactive

253
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,100
plants have different methylation than

254
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,680
humans as I mentioned before there's CPG

255
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:21,100
methylation there's CEHD methylation in

256
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,810
there CH h methylation and this means

257
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,970
the patterns a little bit more complex

258
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,790
to to read them what we see in human

259
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,400
genomes and so what you end up seeing if

260
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,649
you look at just flowers like male

261
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,598
flowers versus female flowers you see a

262
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:37,360
vast array of differential methylation

263
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,219
signals between the genomes now if you

264
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,080
move over to female flowers and female

265
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,669
seeded flowers this picture becomes a

266
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,470
little softer because there's less

267
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:46,840
differences between the genes between

268
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,399
those different biological events and if

269
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,899
you actually categorize them for ones

270
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,250
that are statistically significant the

271
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,809
genes that pop out are things like a

272
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,710
Destin and some of the cannabinoids and

273
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,689
face genes like

274
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,700
see so the methylation patterns are

275
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,560
giving us some picture of which genes

276
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,330
are on and off and it's a very sort of

277
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,179
simple survey that helps compliment

278
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,590
anything you do with RNA now that does

279
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:07,269
bring us to the RNA side of things

280
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,009
there's before jump on there there's a

281
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:10,720
500 to 700 different sites that are

282
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:12,370
hyper or hyper mo fellated with very

283
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,529
strong p-values that we're paying close

284
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,389
attention to and combing through but you

285
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:17,980
really want sequencing information of

286
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,720
the RNA to understand what's going on

287
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,850
here and so there are these great new

288
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,529
tools from Pacific Biosciences that

289
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,500
allow you to sequence an entire RNA

290
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:28,179
molecule 50 to 100 times over as a

291
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,399
single molecule to get better than

292
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:32,289
saying or data to annotate genomes like

293
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,059
this this is something known as ISO seek

294
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:36,039
and when we do this what you're seeing

295
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:38,139
here is the lap the number of laps that

296
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,639
we're getting around the molecule we

297
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:41,679
turn these molecules into circles and

298
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,600
they run like a gerbil on a wheel with a

299
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,339
polymerase measuring incorporation and

300
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,050
you can read this molecule over and over

301
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,910
and over again with these sequencers to

302
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:49,990
get very high accuracy and what you're

303
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:52,419
seeing down below is the average

304
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,769
transcript length that's in the genome

305
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:56,049
so some of them are getting out to be 5

306
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:57,250
KB genes which is quite long and you can

307
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:59,679
see the average in there is around one

308
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,929
to two thousand bases long what this

309
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,219
does it gives us a picture of all the

310
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:06,069
different isoforms that are in the

311
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,960
genome so an isoform is a version of a

312
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,430
gene any given gene can have multiple

313
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,840
exons and those exons can be

314
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:12,129
differentially spliced and when they're

315
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,139
differentially spliced they create a

316
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,639
different RNA molecule so each gene can

317
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,620
have two or three different RNA

318
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,210
molecules coming off of it that's what

319
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,399
we call an isoform and interestingly

320
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,110
enough the male flowers have more

321
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,429
isoforms and the female flowers and

322
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,649
we're in a habit of getting rid of these

323
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:27,699
things as fast as we can find them but

324
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:29,949
we might find some very interesting

325
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,879
biology in there that give us some pause

326
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:36,370
on that on that genocide so what else we

327
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,529
can find from this is we can take these

328
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,120
RNA molecules we can then map them to

329
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,589
the reference genome and then identify

330
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,179
where all the genes are in the genome

331
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,480
and so we can annotate the genome and

332
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:48,579
what we're seeing is around 27,000 genes

333
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,590
that are female gene models and this

334
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,780
gives us an underestimation of the exome

335
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:56,200
size inside cannabis as well it's about

336
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:57,549
44 mega bases of exome there's 35 mega

337
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,460
bases of this that are coding because

338
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:02,469
parts of exomes can be utrs and there's

339
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,060
121 mega bases that if you include the

340
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,350
intron so this is bigger than the human

341
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,119
exome yet the genome

342
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,909
about a third of the size of the human

343
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,840
genome so it's kind of an interesting

344
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:12,759
adaptation that we're seeing in cannabis

345
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,290
and of course if you're gonna do this in

346
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,210
females you have to do it in males we

347
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:18,279
just saw that males have more isoforms

348
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,530
and so what we've done it's taken all of

349
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,600
the RNA that we've done from those five

350
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,699
tissues and map them against a male

351
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,139
assembly that we now have and we can

352
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,759
identify that there's even more genes

353
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:29,620
that are active in the male genome this

354
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,419
thirty to thirty two thousand of those

355
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,679
genes and about four thousand of them

356
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,019
that are that are differentially

357
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,699
expressed in the male this also helps us

358
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:38,259
decorate the y chromosome we can see

359
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,730
parts of the Y chromosome now that are

360
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:41,950
about 80 mega bases that do not

361
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,509
recombine with the X chromosome and

362
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,520
about 30 mega bases that is still

363
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,929
recombining with the X chromosome so if

364
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,159
you're gonna build any sex tests you

365
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,959
want to put it in the region of the Y

366
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,809
that does not Rican by Nando I show you

367
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,370
run into some trouble likewise another

368
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:56,109
paper great paper came out from the

369
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,389
worst burn laboratory doing more mass

370
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,009
spec on cannabis genomes and we soaked

371
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:01,419
up those fast day files and compared

372
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:04,480
them to the more recent references we

373
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:07,059
have in 98.8% of the mass spec data is

374
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,620
detected inside the genome now we have

375
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,379
the advantage of being able to amplify

376
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,909
RNA so we can pick up more really low

377
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:14,799
incident events it's very hard to

378
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:16,899
amplify proteins and so it's not

379
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,209
surprising that the protein systems are

380
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,039
not finding all of the peptides are

381
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,810
finding about 40% of what we see in the

382
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,089
genome but there's a very high overlap

383
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:27,069
with what they do find is being real and

384
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,810
so these can be very complementary tools

385
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,640
because you can pick up like oscillation

386
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:33,669
and other signals with with the mass

387
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,199
spec data okay so let's let's look at a

388
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,789
couple examples here's and here's a gene

389
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,220
that has been studied heavily by

390
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:41,079
Jonathan page called the the pile

391
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,690
transferase gene it's involved in taking

392
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,490
a live italic acid and converting it

393
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,830
into cannabic erikak acid but it can do

394
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,230
it in two different ways and the plant

395
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,480
predominantly is making this form CB GA

396
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,129
but what we're seeing in the genome is

397
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,870
that there are several cases of tissue

398
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:58,149
specific expression of alternative

399
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,740
isoforms where we see two exons skipped

400
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:01,299
in the female flowers and three exon

401
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,930
skipped in the male flowers we don't

402
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:04,299
know what that means

403
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:06,549
it may have some may play some role and

404
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:08,379
giving us some alternative synthesized

405
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:10,659
cannabinoids it's that's something yet

406
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:11,889
to be yet to be resolved now there's

407
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,899
some other things people always ask is

408
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,789
what other genes are being Co inherited

409
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,919
with the cannabinoids right these

410
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:18,439
cannabinoids synthase gene clusters have

411
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,029
been shown

412
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,460
have very low recombination between them

413
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:23,809
so it makes you question what's the

414
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,100
linkage disequilibrium with and what

415
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,959
other genes are coming along for the

416
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,190
ride on those haplotypes well this is

417
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,840
the cannabic chromium synthase gene

418
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,430
cluster there's eight copies of the gene

419
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,590
all directionally oriented in one

420
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:35,959
direction and on the boundaries of this

421
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:38,090
of this gene we seem elect in expression

422
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,500
and we see angkeran expression these are

423
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,060
genes that are known to be involved in

424
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,769
pathogen defense that seem to be going

425
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:45,109
along for the ride with cannabic roaming

426
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:46,549
that's kind of initial little story the

427
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,779
THC synthase story is even more

428
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:50,000
interesting and that what you see

429
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,399
flanking THC s in the genome are

430
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,440
transpose aces these are enzymes that

431
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,879
copy chunks of DNA and shuttle them all

432
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,470
over the genome and it's probably the

433
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:59,149
reason why we have a cannabinoid gene

434
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,040
expansion inside of cannabis these

435
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:03,409
transposons are probably cutting it and

436
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,319
pasting it everywhere they can but also

437
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,639
within this same cluster are

438
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,140
differentially expressed cannabinoids

439
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,179
and face genes that we don't know what

440
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,039
they do these are getting differentially

441
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:14,779
expressed in different tissues and this

442
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,159
particular one shocked us because it

443
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,720
actually has an intron it most

444
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,990
cannabinoids synthase genes are believed

445
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,639
to be one exon very easy to study when

446
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,169
they start having introns then they can

447
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,389
alternately splice and give you more

448
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:28,339
common at Oryx and on isoforms and so

449
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:30,080
that's the first time we've seen in

450
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,820
intron inside of a functional

451
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,139
cannabinoid sensation at least one

452
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,720
that's getting expressed and in frame

453
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,689
what we see genome-wide is about 90 of

454
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,710
these different genes that have pfm

455
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,290
designation as a cannabinoid synthase

456
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,720
genes so there's a lot of genes to to

457
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:47,929
comb through here this is one that stood

458
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,279
out on the the CBDs con take this is

459
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,799
what's known as the self-incompatibility

460
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,809
protein that's used to prevent plants

461
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:56,599
from self pollinating all right so if

462
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:58,159
you have an obligate out crosser you're

463
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,750
gonna probably want this gene so you

464
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,209
can't self yourself now this is probably

465
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,710
a historical remnant of the hemp lines

466
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,629
which were known to be malicious but

467
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,430
once we move to dioecious plants those

468
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,838
things become obligate out crossers and

469
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:10,429
we don't know what the function of this

470
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,830
is but it's only expressed in male

471
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:14,120
flowers it may be may be very helpful to

472
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,800
understand what if we want to understand

473
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,950
hermaphroditism because hermaphroditism

474
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:21,649
is is probably linked into this into the

475
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:24,110
split now what you can see here is is

476
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,779
that this self-incompatibility gene is

477
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,700
tissue specifically expressed only in

478
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,458
male flowers and happens to be right

479
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,778
next door to CBD a s including a bunch

480
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,698
other novels and face genes that are

481
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:36,708
differentially expressed as well in a

482
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:38,719
very tissue specific manner so we have a

483
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,729
lot to do to understand the complexity

484
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,649
of the cannabinoid synthase genes and we

485
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,938
can't just be looking in female flowers

486
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,708
to find it we're gonna have to be

487
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:48,948
looking at at multiple tissues to

488
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:50,838
understand this so in speaking of that

489
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:53,479
we have to also look at the male genomes

490
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,490
the male x x and y chromosome so the

491
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,159
largest chromosomes in cannabis and the

492
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,079
Y the Y is actually larger than the X so

493
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,058
what's on the Y chromosome well what we

494
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,558
did is we took the RNA off of the male

495
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:05,389
flowers mapped it to the female

496
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:07,490
reference genome we have in the reads

497
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:10,278
that didn't map to the female we would

498
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,379
then map back to the male genome to tell

499
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,360
us which ones were male specifically

500
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:16,759
expressed and that gives you a hint as

501
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,289
to what parts of the genome are in fact

502
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,089
the white chromosome because none of

503
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:22,669
this stuff matches to the female genome

504
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:24,410
however female genomes can also have a

505
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:26,058
lot of structural variation in there so

506
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:28,068
this doesn't necessarily tell us that

507
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:30,198
this is all Y it tells us it's either Y

508
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:31,458
or it's in a structural variant in the

509
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,688
female genome then we're going to touch

510
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:35,239
on structural variants in just a minute

511
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:36,259
but this does give us a list of over 118

512
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,028
megabases of

513
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:39,740
target genome that is differentially

514
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:41,058
expressed or only expressed in the

515
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,889
male's compared to the females and

516
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:45,198
there's a lot of gene content in there

517
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:46,369
as well that to pay attention to now if

518
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:47,868
you really want to resolve the Y

519
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:49,278
perfectly the right thing to do is to

520
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:51,170
sequence three genomes what's known as a

521
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,789
trio a brother a sister and their

522
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:54,318
offspring is what we chose to sequence

523
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:56,509
here so it's a bit of an inbred cross

524
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:59,479
and when you do this you end up with

525
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:01,129
fairly routine and 50s over a mega base

526
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,749
in all cases we did not do any

527
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:04,578
optimization here we basically just

528
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:06,078
purified high molecular weight DNA put

529
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:09,048
it through this equal to platform and

530
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,788
out pop 1.6 mega base and 50s as a

531
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:12,318
comparison of reference point the human

532
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:14,689
genome a project went down to the White

533
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,119
House to celebrate 500 KB and 50s back

534
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,939
in 2000 and we're still waiting for

535
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,558
Donald's invite to celebrate this one

536
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:24,500
but I'm suspect it's coming anytime soon

537
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:27,470
but all of the all of the busco scores

538
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,329
are easily above 97% with just using a

539
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,159
single method so this is actually really

540
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:32,269
reassuring because in the past to tackle

541
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:33,770
genomes like this you'd have to deploy

542
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:35,569
five or six different methods to really

543
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:37,879
to really kill it and that's coming I

544
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:40,158
think coming to a close soon so this is

545
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,539
the actual family of other Jamaican

546
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,070
lines that we've sequence the rest of

547
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:44,200
these we hit with a short read platform

548
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:46,269
known as aluminum

549
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,019
and what you're seeing above each one of

550
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:52,210
these genome pictures here is a coverage

551
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:53,980
map across the BTB d allele the genes

552
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,450
that we just went over from that are

553
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,950
coding for the cannabinoid synthase

554
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,389
genes if you look at the coverage map

555
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,190
across those you can predict what

556
00:17:58,388 --> 00:18:02,168
cannabinoids did the plant is going to

557
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,720
make alright and that that can be seen

558
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:07,149
in this little diagram here we can

559
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,710
detect with this tool that's on canopy

560
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:10,748
dia whether it's gonna be a type 1 type

561
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,249
2 type 3 or type 4 plant just from the

562
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:15,210
Illumina sequence coverage profiles

563
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:17,889
alone if they have an active THC allele

564
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,440
we know that's gonna make some THC if

565
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:22,028
that's in combination with a CBD gene

566
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,249
that's not even in the genome we know

567
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:25,690
it's a type 1 plant when all three of

568
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:26,649
these contacts are present we know it's

569
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,840
a type 2 plant

570
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:32,018
when only the act of CBD contexts

571
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,878
present and there is no THC contador the

572
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,739
CBD s inactive we know it's going to be

573
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:37,959
a type 3 plant and when none of them are

574
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,608
present it tends to be a CPG plant so

575
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,608
just looking at the coverage Maps alone

576
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:43,720
we can sort out it's it's its chemical

577
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,249
expression at least on those three

578
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,139
cannabinoids the other thing that you

579
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,239
want to do is compare this to other type

580
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:50,858
3 plants so Chris grasa is here and

581
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:53,169
presenting later later I think today or

582
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:56,199
tomorrow on a genome that's a type 3

583
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:58,119
plant a hemp line known as CBD rx and so

584
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,470
we like to do is always align the

585
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:00,878
reference genomes that we have is to

586
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,019
make Alliance what other people have

587
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:03,759
found in other states and other

588
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,288
jurisdictions to see that we come to

589
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,429
some level of consensus on this and

590
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:08,440
we're beginning to see that with both

591
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:11,340
the male and female genomes what you're

592
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,690
seeing here is a continued to continuous

593
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:15,638
alignment of our genomes to theirs and

594
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,350
you see these diagonal lines those all

595
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:18,788
represent the chromosomes the 10

596
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:20,738
chromosomes that you see in cannabis and

597
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:23,798
so we're beginning to get genomes that

598
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:26,288
now share a lot of a lot of content now

599
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:27,908
the next thing that we did is we took 40

600
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:29,798
genomes and sequence them with aluminum

601
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:31,269
now these are shorter reed systems that

602
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:32,349
can't get you to the whole genome and

603
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:33,669
they can't get you all the structural

604
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:35,259
variants but they can get you to all the

605
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,179
snips and the small insertions and

606
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,980
deletions in the genome so this year is

607
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:40,538
a histogram of the number of variants

608
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,429
that we see between the lines the

609
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:44,108
jamaican lion genomes are here and

610
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:45,700
they're usually 2 to 3 million variants

611
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:48,519
between those siblings but when you get

612
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,259
up into comparing those to hemp lines it

613
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,659
jumps up to about 12 million variants

614
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:54,860
all right as a perspective here the

615
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,150
human genome is going to have a part of

616
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,939
tenth of the number of variants that

617
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,019
we're seeing here per cannabis line

618
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,460
there's about a variant every thousand

619
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:02,808
bases in human there's one every 90

620
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,308
bases here in cannabis so there's a

621
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:06,319
tremendous amount of diversity here that

622
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:07,639
we have to comb through we also have

623
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,619
some sense of the insertions and

624
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,960
deletions from this data the data set as

625
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:13,548
well but what you can do when you have

626
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,170
the RNA data layered on top of the

627
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:16,849
genome is you know where all the genes

628
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,200
are so now you can take the variant

629
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,969
information and ask well how many of

630
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,980
those genes are broken by those variants

631
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,420
do we have any like frameshift mutations

632
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,670
do we have any stop codons that are

633
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,990
disappearing do we have any any start

634
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,640
codons that are changing and you do this

635
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,589
with a program known as sniff PFF it

636
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,299
looks at the heart of the impact of the

637
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:34,308
variants so we just went through and

638
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,440
asked how many high impact variants do

639
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:38,389
we have per cultivar because in humans

640
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,730
those numbers are really low in plants

641
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,880
like cannabis there's over 2,200 high

642
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,589
impact variants per cultivar so we've

643
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,630
got a lot to understand about what this

644
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:50,928
type of diversity actually actually

645
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,250
means you can also take all of this

646
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:55,040
sequencing data from the Illumina

647
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:57,529
platform map that all 40 of the genomes

648
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,720
to the male reference and what you see

649
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:01,609
here are 40 genomes lined up top the

650
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,798
bottom here these top ones are male

651
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:05,990
genomes and we're looking at the density

652
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,548
of coverage across all of the contexts

653
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,190
in the genome and it what's interesting

654
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:11,629
is the females have none here the red

655
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,029
means there's no coverage or at least

656
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,890
twofold less coverage than an average

657
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:17,389
and the yellow is twofold or greater

658
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,640
more coverage than average and so

659
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,500
instantly from a picture like this you

660
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,720
can identify all the contexts that are

661
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,509
present in the male's absent in the

662
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,460
females present at half the coverage in

663
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:30,440
the males and double the coverage in the

664
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,819
females that tells you X and y so now

665
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,769
we've got a list of all the genetic

666
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:35,990
content and the genes that are on x and

667
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:37,359
y so we can begin to understand what

668
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,630
things are really related to

669
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,519
hermaphroditism

670
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,990
a couple of interesting genes that pop

671
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:43,250
out on the Y we have some flowering

672
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,990
low-side we want to pay attention to

673
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,940
there's a cow cone synthase in there

674
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,500
there's a trichome gene involved there's

675
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,900
a downy mildew resistance gene that's

676
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,298
involved in there so a lot of activity

677
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,440
and the Y we don't want to ignore that

678
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:56,808
but the other thing that popped out of

679
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,039
this data completely accidentally was

680
00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:00,139
with three of the genomes that are in

681
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:02,470
there from Colorado seeds this is an

682
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,020
interesting cross they've done that

683
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,548
that has some some some interesting

684
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:07,509
properties I'll say but what was

685
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:09,908
interesting about this is there are

686
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:11,200
these three hot spots that this to us is

687
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:12,520
a copy number variant when you see

688
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,720
something really bright yellow on this

689
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,139
map it tells you it's been replicated

690
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,880
and without knowing that this plant was

691
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,700
powdery mildew resistance we called them

692
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,080
up saying hey we have regions of your

693
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,019
genome that are amplified and they

694
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,329
happen to map to a gene that is powdery

695
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:29,589
mildew resistant in hops what do you

696
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:30,609
know about this plant I said well that's

697
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:31,899
interesting this thing it never gets

698
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:33,579
powdery mildew would surrounded by it

699
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,650
all the time and we want to know more

700
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:37,720
about that we weren't even looking for

701
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,640
this and it just jumped out by looking

702
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,140
at these these coverage maps so that

703
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,610
might be an interesting marker that we

704
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,360
want to track as we breed it into other

705
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:47,769
plants okay so let's touch on structural

706
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:49,240
variants I still have some time on

707
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:51,009
structural variants so many of you may

708
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,569
be familiar with snip chips sniffs are

709
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:54,158
great for looking at single single base

710
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:55,418
pair variants maybe some of the small

711
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,950
end else but when you want to look at

712
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:58,630
things that are up to 50 base pair

713
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,460
insertion and deletions you usually

714
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,200
migrate to something like an Illumina

715
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,700
sequencer those are great at getting

716
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,590
some of the in Dells up to about that

717
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,419
size once you start getting larger than

718
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:08,980
that it's very difficult to ascertain

719
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,750
them with short reads you need long

720
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,730
reads to do this and the important thing

721
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,940
about doing this with long reads is that

722
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,679
the the vast majority of the variant

723
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,360
information in the genome is usually the

724
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,950
structural variants they're not very

725
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,599
frequent in terms of their incident rate

726
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,909
but they happen to contain large chunks

727
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:26,349
of DNA in almost entire genes so you

728
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:28,840
really need to pay attention to the

729
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:30,129
structural variants and and get on board

730
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,509
with some of these long read sequencers

731
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,720
what you're seeing here is a graph of

732
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:36,279
that the the variant size and the

733
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,929
cumulative percent of a percentage of

734
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,308
them that that they make up in a genome

735
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,769
and so you can see that there are a

736
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:44,109
tremendous amount of variants that are

737
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:45,519
large like 10 KB in size and encompass a

738
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:47,859
tremendous amount of either regulatory

739
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,058
elements or genes and humans what you

740
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,859
see is around seven of these per

741
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:52,119
megabase and then this jumps order of

742
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:53,949
magnitude when you get in the maze

743
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:55,599
there's about 70 of these per megabase

744
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,058
and you can see that the short read

745
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,439
systems have a very low sensitivity for

746
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:01,450
picking these things up and so you're

747
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,940
blind to these if we're only using the

748
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,620
Illumina sequencers when you put in 20x

749
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,750
coverage on these with these long reads

750
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:10,389
you see them all and it becomes a really

751
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,119
interesting story that is represented

752
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,649
here here we can see over 17,000

753
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,250
heterozygous and almost 10,000

754
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:18,109
homozygous deletions in the male

755
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:21,200
our almost an equal number of those of

756
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:22,939
insertions likewise the offspring there

757
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,980
has a similar number of deletions and

758
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,509
insertions in the in the histogram of

759
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,769
the size of these things is down here

760
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:29,450
below so there's clearly some kind of

761
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:31,940
repeat element in the genome that's

762
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,009
jumping up and around 10 KB as being

763
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,289
inserted and deleted inside the genome

764
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:39,079
this makes you question what the heck is

765
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:41,000
in this stuff if this is just one inbred

766
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,829
cross in a trio and there's this much

767
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,119
stuff jumping around this is like an

768
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:45,649
eighth of the genome in structural

769
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,169
variation this is extraordinarily

770
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,930
plastic when it comes to come it comes

771
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,550
to a genome and it's not necessarily

772
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,140
containing boring things we're seeing

773
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:55,879
terpene synthase genes that are in these

774
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,450
parts and these structural variants in

775
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,670
the genome

776
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,970
alright so TPF 17 is a bit immersing

777
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:04,009
gene and we also have other TPS 10 and

778
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,860
TPS 30 like or perhaps making alpha

779
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:08,660
pining and delimiting not oh and in the

780
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:10,279
terpene landscape a single gene does not

781
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,480
make a single terpene one gene can make

782
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,859
multiple terpenes and there can be

783
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,960
multiple copies of that gene may

784
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:17,719
contribute asain terpene so just by this

785
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,220
beta mersin being dropped out doesn't

786
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,750
mean it doesn't make any mercy there's

787
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,180
other genes that will probably have low

788
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,339
compensate for that but we also see this

789
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,660
in the triterpene nobody is measuring

790
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:27,769
for tri terpenes right now in the labs

791
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,360
we need to be looking at these things

792
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:30,740
because the flavanols are in there and

793
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,329
people are publishing on how the can

794
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,329
flavin genes are in fact having an

795
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:36,589
impact and pancreatic cancer and in pain

796
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:38,929
yet it's a molecule that the plant makes

797
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:40,609
that we don't track likewise these other

798
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,960
triterpene seem to have some interesting

799
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:43,699
characteristics as well and we think

800
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,650
we'd love to see those getting into the

801
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,630
analytical chemistry labs now we're

802
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,630
tracking all of this stuff in a web site

803
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,220
known as canopy dia and what this system

804
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,320
enables is for people to sequence

805
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,240
partial genomes or complete genomes and

806
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,189
put the data public or hold a private

807
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,599
depending on their need but it allows

808
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,920
you to compare that genome to everything

809
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,389
else we have in the database so you can

810
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,740
get a phylogenetic tree of what it's

811
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,020
related to and what it's the most

812
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,970
distant to and how heterozygous it is

813
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:10,700
and how backcross it is and we can also

814
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,589
scan for the BTB d allele to know if you

815
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,850
what type of plant it is and whether

816
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:15,619
that's gonna step on any intellectual

817
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:17,869
property that's out there but all of

818
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:19,879
this is linked into a a blockchain

819
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:22,519
system so that then time stamps and the

820
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,220
notarization czar uneditable by us if we

821
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,720
disappear your data still has links into

822
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,140
a blockchain that is distributed around

823
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,029
the world

824
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,970
old and your time stamps cannot be

825
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:33,319
changed by anyone at our company now

826
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,970
this is we're starting to integrate some

827
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:36,559
genome browsers into this as well so

828
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,049
people can kind of peruse their genome

829
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,389
next to this is down below this is what

830
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:42,919
the 40 genomes snip variant file looks

831
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,480
like theirs looks like there's almost a

832
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,580
snip at every single location throughout

833
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,900
the genome when you put this many

834
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:49,279
genomes in there but if you zoom in it's

835
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,680
not that it's not that it's not that

836
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,359
sparse but nevertheless it can be a very

837
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,490
helpful tool for for analyzing your

838
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,899
genome and now since the data up there

839
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,430
is public there's been over seven

840
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,080
publications that have just scraped data

841
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:01,610
off of that site and published their own

842
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,129
analysis of it so that it's been

843
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:06,319
thoroughly vetted and it's it's growing

844
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,820
every day so with a few minutes left I'm

845
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,099
just going to touch on what you can do

846
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:11,839
what applications can you do with genome

847
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:13,159
structures like this and sequences like

848
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,539
this well we first thing we started to

849
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,550
do was to build a fingerprinting tool

850
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:19,730
that only needed 16 snips to identify

851
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:20,629
cannabis strain and we want it to be 16

852
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,370
snips that we can do it on a

853
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,780
quantitative PCR instrument in an hour

854
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:25,669
we don't have to necessarily send it out

855
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:27,170
to a sequencing lab we can we can

856
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:30,680
basically get parentage information from

857
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:32,300
16 wells at a 96-well plate inside that

858
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,180
system that we've built we also have

859
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:37,129
that CBD and THC allele so we can

860
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,930
measure the BT VD allele on a plant with

861
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,240
a genotype and in a PCR well now which

862
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:45,230
is quite nice and it also makes you want

863
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,359
to think about doing RNA a PCR can you

864
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,980
do qpcr and RNA of the terpenes or the

865
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,209
cannabinoid genes to understand at what

866
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,180
stage does development are you getting

867
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,960
hyper or hypo expression of those genes

868
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,519
and then we're beginning to work on

869
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,799
viruses as well there's some great work

870
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,750
that was published by dark art nurseries

871
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,919
recently on the hops Layton virus so

872
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,650
we've made an assay out of what they

873
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,060
discovered and we also did a half's out

874
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,920
of lettuce chlorosis virus that was

875
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,899
published in israel recently and threw

876
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,080
in a third one known as CC v1 so you can

877
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,980
start to track the actual viruses that

878
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,929
might be spreading through the

879
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,130
population and then two other things

880
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,539
that we're playing around with is some

881
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,450
work with arbor where we're making

882
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:22,099
different panels that can capture a

883
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,509
thousand genes or 50 genes at a time and

884
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:25,099
sequence those so that people can take

885
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:27,109
more bite-sized pieces out of the genome

886
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:29,149
and analyze them this current one has

887
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:30,529
the synthesis in face jeans and the

888
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,880
Edisto genes I think they have a booth

889
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:33,200
here describing this panel that they've

890
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,600
built and a lot of that was built off

891
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,580
the Jamaican line references and we're

892
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,309
also making multiplex tools to measure

893
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:39,480
the micro

894
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:41,460
that are in the plant and down below

895
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,440
there is just a five color Aspergillus

896
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,269
assay for tracking things in in

897
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,440
California and then the final thing

898
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:48,660
we're just toying around with this

899
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,370
really early is pollen traps there's all

900
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,830
this problems with pollen floating on to

901
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:55,169
open v open field cannabis farms right

902
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:57,000
now and so we are trying to do here is

903
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,500
quantitate the amount of male

904
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,690
parliaments in the air and the amount of

905
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,369
THC Laden pollen that's in the air with

906
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,600
these $50 pollen traps that you can

907
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:05,849
throw in the corners of your property

908
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,869
and see if there are a lot of pollen

909
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:08,399
that is blowing in that might be

910
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:10,199
destroying your grow in the next couple

911
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,730
years so a lot can be done with genetics

912
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,660
and I want to thank all these people

913
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,610
that helped us do it

914
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,140
- really kicked off the snow mulling of

915
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,699
this and then PacBio was pivotal in

916
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,710
providing that the technology that could

917
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,789
sequence these genomes New England

918
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,500
Biolabs did a lot of the methylation

919
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:24,029
work and some of the sequencing work you

920
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,410
can work on the Novus seek and we've

921
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,910
done some work with phase genomics and

922
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,430
the other parties here to actually piece

923
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,110
the genome in some more contiguous shape

924
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,120
and then all of these people were

925
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:34,409
required to make this happen it really

926
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,389
does take a village and a tremendous

927
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:38,550
amount of collaboration as dr. Mutulu

928
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,500
was saying so with that I want to leave

929
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:43,379
a few seconds here for for questions if

930
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,849
possible and if not we will roll over to

931
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,210
the next section which i think is a

932
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:51,288
panel thank you

933
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,288
