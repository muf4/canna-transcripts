00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,918
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,960
thanks brian

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,480
thanks everybody so yeah i'm ryan lynch

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,160
i'm uh

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,519
certainly not a medical doctor or

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,320
any type of expert in health care but

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,320
what i do have a background in is

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,960
non-human

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,719
non-animal genomics genetics and

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,719
biodiversity assays

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,839
and so as we've heard throughout all the

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,839
amazing talks today

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,960
it's clear that there's the need to

14
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,839
really understand the source of all

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,920
these different

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,360
therapeutic compounds and combinations

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,359
of different compounds

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,359
that seem to be so compelling

19
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,078
so i don't have any type of strong

20
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,959
personal story that got that got me

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,079
involved with this

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,399
it was more of an uh

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,039
scientifically and just sort of a

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,920
general curiosity and

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,640
an identification of of just a clear

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,879
lack of study of the system

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
and so what i've observed and i think

28
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,879
what we've all seen anybody that's

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
that's

30
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,280
worked with the plants is that there's

31
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,879
this tremendous phenotypic diversity

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
and whether that's the you know the

33
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,158
branching structure the leaf morphology

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,079
the smell the bouquet the aroma that

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,719
comes through from the terpenoid

36
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,798
compounds you know the perceived effects

37
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,078
when you consume it or the therapeutic

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,680
outcomes that we're

39
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,000
hopefully going to be able to nail down

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,640
with some more uh

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,478
carefully controlled clinical trials

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,840
there's clearly a lot of different

43
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,840
types or varieties of cannabis out there

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,000
and so given my background i'd yeah i

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,840
decided that

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,478
dna sequencing and analysis would be

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,240
one of the best ways to approach some of

48
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,560
these questions so

49
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,438
a little outline of i think some of the

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,800
the best applications

51
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,719
for cannabis dna analysis

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,000
i i like to think of it as uh you know

53
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,039
there are ways to look

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,280
into uh the past

55
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,000
you know the history of the plants it's

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,560
at least six thousand years

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,159
of domestication and transport around

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,920
the planet

59
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,840
there's certainly a lot of debate about

60
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,958
uh you know the different

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,000
species name systems nomenclatures

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,680
varieties you know there's also the

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
operational

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,719
functional names that people associate

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,080
with

66
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,080
the indica and the sativa

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,680
words although those date back to the

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,719
1700s from

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,719
linnaeus and lamarck

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
but i think for me the most interesting

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,840
thing and it was

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
really highlighted listening to all the

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,598
the wonderful talks today

74
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,199
was uh more the functional side of it i

75
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,959
think that we can

76
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,119
debate the taxonomy and what you should

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,759
call what uh endlessly and it probably

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,640
won't be

79
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,359
resolved anytime soon in my opinion

80
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,399
there's probably

81
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,640
you know we should be just calling it

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,760
one species at this point but it is an

83
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,479
open question but more importantly

84
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,079
you know we can leverage different

85
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,518
layers of information to start

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,800
understand

87
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,158
uh you know some of the uh underlying

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
causes

89
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,679
of these different chemo profiles that

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,959
mark just uh

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,799
very carefully described so that's

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
that's going to take a lot of academic

93
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,159
discourse and modeling and so forth

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
and the more immediate present we can go

95
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,039
through

96
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,079
and just clean up uh some of the issues

97
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,079
that we have with

98
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
the names that you're seeing in the the

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,400
various state markets

100
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,840
and that's important because uh patients

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
and

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,158
consumers you know they they they have

103
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,199
expectations and

104
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,079
they uh they associate different effects

105
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,359
with these different names and so that's

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,239
something that

107
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,200
we can immediately start to draw lines

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,719
in the sand

109
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,318
and begin to set some standards

110
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,840
and as a side effect of that you can

111
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,479
also

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,579
start

113
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,579
[Music]

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
helping to establish

115
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,959
proof of ownership at a certain point in

116
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,199
time through the sequencing data

117
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,399
so the other thing i'll touch on at the

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,600
end i won't really have time to go on

119
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,519
this but

120
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,080
going big scaling up developing new

121
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,719
strains automation

122
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:42,079
full agricultural genomics combined with

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,280
modern breeding techniques

124
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,439
so an important caveat i think that uh

125
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,519
it's important i have to remind myself

126
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,160
this sometimes is uh

127
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,719
you know the dna is is the code of life

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,040
it's it's the instruction manual

129
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,160
the issue right now and it's incredible

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
the technological

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,880
uh revolutions that uh have led us to be

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
able to now you know access

133
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,159
every letter in that instruction manual

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,399
many times over

135
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,439
for you know hundreds or just thousands

136
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,399
of dollars

137
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,800
for human and and plant plant genomes

138
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,239
and so

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
in the case of the cannabis genome

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,960
that's 800 million

141
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,879
or a little bit more base pairs so you

142
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,638
have all the information but we're still

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,399
we're still at the at the uh you know

144
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,280
this isn't jurassic park or anything so

145
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,319
it's not like

146
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,679
it's important to keep in mind that

147
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,439
we're not going to be able to take that

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,680
digitalized information

149
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,959
and go in and recreate some type of

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,879
unique strain

151
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,239
and in some cases we don't even know you

152
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,680
know we can't even interpret what it

153
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,079
would become

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,720
so there's there's uh it's still really

155
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,719
a

156
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,880
developing field in that sense and it's

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,880
uh important to keep that in mind

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,240
so to address some of those questions

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
it's uh

160
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,199
it's been an interesting process you

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
know i started at the university of

162
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,478
colorado

163
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,840
and uh you know just towards the end of

164
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,000
last year

165
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,758
um you know transitioned into uh the

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,439
medicinal genomics and it's it's uh

167
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,680
this this issue has continued get

168
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,439
getting samples out of different grows

169
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
has always been a unique challenge it's

170
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,959
uh not something where we can just pick

171
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,959
up a flower sample at your local

172
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,519
dispensary and then take it onto campus

173
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,560
legally so it's been some some

174
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,000
interesting stories there

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,478
driving around with a trunk full of

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,399
centrifuges and pipette tips and

177
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,839
training training people that have been

178
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,159
growing their whole lives to do these

179
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,119
dna extractions and then

180
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,880
dealing with bar coding and sample

181
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
labeling issues so

182
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,478
it's it hasn't been easy but um you know

183
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,478
this is

184
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:41,360
just a a small array of just one grow

185
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,439
a medical dispensary in colorado and

186
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,080
just some of the the interesting

187
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,079
shapes and leaflet blade morphologies

188
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,598
and colors that

189
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,598
that they had in stock at the time

190
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,198
so just a really quick overview on the

191
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,800
the sequencing technology i found this

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,439
the other night it's a nice white paper

193
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,120
by

194
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,279
fluorogenix so if you're interested in

195
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,840
the details i think this is a

196
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,119
a really nice schematic and so what it

197
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,359
does is it

198
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,360
it represents the genome as that that

199
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,160
dark blue line at the top

200
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
and then it goes through all the

201
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
different

202
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,720
steps that it takes to do the sequencing

203
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
and so

204
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,880
i i think the best to just look look at

205
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
the bottom down there and compare versus

206
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,360
whole genome shotgun sequencing which is

207
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,639
what uh

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,360
i started out doing it it fragments the

209
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,960
the original genome uh into random

210
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
little segments and then you sequence

211
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,359
all that and then you realign it back to

212
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,120
a reference and so as you can see uh

213
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,879
that create that that does cover the

214
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,439
entire genome but it takes

215
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:48,319
more uh more sequencing runs to

216
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,439
get that information compared to the rad

217
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,280
seek restriction

218
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,240
site associated techniques that we're

219
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,239
using now so if you counted the stacks

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,000
the number of sequences and the rad

221
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
stacks it would be fewer

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,918
than the shotgun sequencing and so the

223
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,038
important point there is that it's

224
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,959
uh these techniques have allowed us to

225
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,560
sequence more samples and gain enough

226
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,918
information to do the analyses we're

227
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,839
interested in

228
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,839
while keeping costs down

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,160
so to answer some of the relatedness

230
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
questions that i find really interesting

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,280
and i think have some direct

232
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,959
applications to

233
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,119
most people involved in the industry

234
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,598
i've i've relied on a series of

235
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,199
different

236
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,240
uh uh methods to infer relatedness and

237
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,440
um

238
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,680
behind you know there's a number of

239
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
different models and algorithms and so

240
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,559
forth but

241
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,080
i just wanted to point out some of the

242
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,158
the uh the nomenclature

243
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,759
that we use to uh interpret the

244
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,639
visualizations

245
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,200
and so the obvious ones are the toxon

246
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,838
those are the

247
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,600
the samples the strain or the variety

248
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,360
and then there's the uh

249
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,720
the branch which is really important and

250
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,879
so if you wanted to compare the

251
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
relatedness between for example

252
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,039
species d and e you would add up those

253
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,039
uh those branch lengths

254
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,719
on the x-axis and what's important to

255
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,240
keep in mind is a little bit misleading

256
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,160
about these renderings is that

257
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,680
the distance on the y-axis isn't

258
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,120
actually included

259
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:15,120
in that calculation so the other point

260
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,600
is rooted versus unrooted that's just a

261
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
way

262
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,759
of adding an extra orientation to the

263
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,759
order in which you think

264
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,039
different taxa have diverged and so with

265
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,600
cannabis

266
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,399
we don't have well we know that the

267
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,040
nearest

268
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,958
plant relative is hops cumulus but we

269
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,199
don't have the molecular

270
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,319
reference tools to really use that so

271
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,040
all the

272
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,600
phylogenetic trees i'll show are are

273
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,599
unrooted

274
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,958
so the other thing to keep in mind i

275
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,680
pulled this off of uh

276
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:49,838
icymag.com a few days ago is that uh

277
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,599
you know cannabis i mean it has a very

278
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,560
convoluted history i mean people have

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,480
been

280
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,958
doing this in their basement for decades

281
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,959
in terms of

282
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,959
prohibition era breeding and you know

283
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
moving these things around the world in

284
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,838
very small batches

285
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,320
and then there's the issue of course on

286
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,320
the production side where

287
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,000
you really typically do not want a lot

288
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,560
of pollen in your facility so

289
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,039
we've had a bottleneck in terms of male

290
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,399
genetics and so

291
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,719
this schematic that was just put

292
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,879
together through somebody's

293
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,480
recollection so i don't know how

294
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,480
accurate that might be but

295
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,920
you know it really looks more like a web

296
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,920
than a bifurcating tree

297
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:36,078
and so a compromise we came up with was

298
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,120
a tool that allow it's sort of a hybrid

299
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,120
that allows

300
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
inference of both network-like structure

301
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,120
relatedness and

302
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,839
tree structure and so this is from a

303
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,799
paper that

304
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,560
i did with nolan and the rest of the the

305
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,120
kane lab

306
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,319
and uh finally got it out in a review so

307
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,278
it was a quite a battle

308
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
with the editors and uh the point here

309
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:57,439
there are

310
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,360
of course sample names on all those i

311
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,959
think it's about uh it's just under 200

312
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,159
samples and

313
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,078
there's a full 4 mb high resolution

314
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,879
version if you want to check it out on

315
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,599
the pre-print server but after a number

316
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,919
of different

317
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,040
clustering and structural analysis

318
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,719
models

319
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,159
we were able to recover significant

320
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,120
evidence for

321
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,278
three broad types of cannabis diversity

322
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,240
and we borrowed nomenclature from

323
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,559
rob clark and mark merlin and so we

324
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
called those the broad leaflet drug type

325
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,399
and if you were to zoom in on those

326
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,839
you'd be able to see a lot of names that

327
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,000
have cush in them

328
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,640
and actually some samples that we have

329
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,278
pretty good confidence were actually

330
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,319
brought over from afghanistan so these

331
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,000
are

332
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,480
shorter stockier um biotypes that uh

333
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,399
we believe originate from the north side

334
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
of the hindu kush mountains

335
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,559
so then you have that big spray kind of

336
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,959
from 11 o'clock all the way down to

337
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,278
uh you know about five o'clock there and

338
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,278
that's that's just a whole mess of other

339
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,399
different varieties that uh we're

340
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,480
lumping in as the

341
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,240
narrow leaflet drug types and then uh

342
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
the most distinct one of course are the

343
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,959
european hemp groups that

344
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:14,000
those are seed and oil fiber types that

345
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:16,719
do not typically get used in drug type

346
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,720
reading so

347
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,399
if you're interested in any of the names

348
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,119
in there i mean some of them are

349
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,720
actually

350
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,320
you know we've been able to recover

351
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,079
clones from different states that are

352
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,399
totally identical but

353
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,479
some of these are not so consistent and

354
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,480
i'll go into some more examples with the

355
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,000
more recent data we've done at medicinal

356
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,959
genomics but i thought that was a good

357
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,639
example an old famous name jacqueriae

358
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,078
i mean it's just it's just all over the

359
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,600
place and

360
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:46,078
maybe there's a little cluster almost

361
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
a hope for some type of consensus down

362
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,439
there at six o'clock but uh it's

363
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,399
certainly uh

364
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,720
it's certainly uh not the same thing and

365
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,440
from

366
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,440
every source

367
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,039
so we don't have uh any of the the

368
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,919
resolution that

369
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,559
mark just showed but we were able to uh

370
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,399
in a way

371
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,759
confirm some of the validity behind

372
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,078
those genetic groups

373
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,799
through looking at the average

374
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,638
cannabinoid and terpene levels and

375
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,319
between those those three groups that we

376
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,000
recovered we found some significant

377
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,360
differences that are

378
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,879
noted with the brackets and the

379
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,320
different levels of significance and the

380
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,078
astra season

381
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,079
so maybe not not uh not huge magnitude

382
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,679
of differences in the thc and the cbd

383
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,399
but

384
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,958
you do find some very interesting hints

385
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,399
at

386
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,159
different genetic backgrounds may

387
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,519
correlate to

388
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,759
some of these different terpenoid

389
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,480
compounds the

390
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,480
the linole and the mercy in particularly

391
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,079
so now at medicinal i mean we've you

392
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,278
know we're really looking to ramp this

393
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,039
up and go from

394
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,360
dozens or hundreds of samples to

395
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,559
thousands and um go from just you know

396
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,320
what we could scrape together in

397
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,719
colorado and maybe stuff people wanted

398
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,440
to send us in california to

399
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,399
uh you know the the all the states where

400
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,440
there's access

401
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,759
and of course uh beyond

402
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,639
and so this is uh really just at the

403
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,120
onset of our launch for this but

404
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,079
we've been able to uh to already make

405
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,919
some great progress

406
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,439
and we're doing a rollout in colorado

407
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,360
and california with us

408
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,760
and we've really upgraded our our

409
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,039
version of the rad seek protocol so

410
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,399
we're getting a very large chunk of data

411
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,120
from the genome

412
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,000
it's a it's actually 10 times more than

413
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
i used in

414
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,720
in my paper and so that that's going to

415
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,959
be a great robust platform that can be

416
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,959
developed into a number of different

417
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,919
types of analysis down the road

418
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,799
and so i have a um actually as of this

419
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,198
wednesday

420
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,958
uh in the uh the colorado estate

421
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,919
tracking system there's going to be

422
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,799
over 100 000 uh products that came from

423
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,599
plants

424
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,639
that we certified and tracked through uh

425
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,560
all the way from

426
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,600
uh clone or seed to to harvest and

427
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,319
product whether that's flour or mips and

428
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,680
so that's

429
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,160
something like i have some other updates

430
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:11,679
here just came through

431
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:14,319
700 pounds of flour and that's uh

432
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,078
just just just at 41 strains so we have

433
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,399
the capacity to do

434
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,838
um hundreds if not if not thousands of

435
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
samples per week

436
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,519
at the the quarter gen medicinal

437
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,240
genomics facility so

438
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,560
um i'm really excited to see what kind

439
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
of

440
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,399
new patterns and stories emerge from

441
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,399
that

442
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,720
so something kevin touched upon uh i

443
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:40,240
think it was last night at dinner

444
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,560
so it was uh you know

445
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,600
trying to tap into to just this global

446
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,479
community

447
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,560
and uh so we've set up a website where

448
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,879
we're going to have different layers of

449
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,479
uh information from our genetic

450
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,600
sequencing efforts

451
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,440
and also our partner labs that are going

452
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,600
to provide chemical

453
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,680
analytics and then also a more

454
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,159
distributed open source section where we

455
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:07,198
can get reviews and

456
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:09,838
different types of feedback and comments

457
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,639
from everybody in the community so

458
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,839
that's we'll be rolling out um step by

459
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,839
step through april and may

460
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,240
so just a little uh a little a couple

461
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:26,239
little um stories from the

462
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,240
latest data hopefully this works

463
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,278
that resolution got downgraded

464
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,360
one thing that popped out to me was we

465
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,079
do have some good some good chemical

466
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,480
data from

467
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,120
sc labs actually generated this for us

468
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,159
and

469
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,600
uh what we can see is that uh you know a

470
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,759
lot of the strains that

471
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,800
are coming through with the higher

472
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,320
elevated cbd

473
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:56,000
to thc ratios are are clearly

474
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,040
quite quite closely related and so it

475
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
suggests that

476
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,240
there's certainly room for improvement

477
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,959
in terms of

478
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,558
introducing that trait with you know

479
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,318
some of the other varieties out there

480
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,119
that have different terpenoid compounds

481
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,639
or you know

482
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,958
other traits of interest that might be

483
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,439
useful whether it's disease resistance

484
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,439
or yield

485
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,599
another thing i thought was interesting

486
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,120
were the this cluster of green samples

487
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,438
you can't see the names there but

488
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,000
they're

489
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,839
they're all different and uh the genetic

490
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,798
distances to me suggest that we've

491
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,759
picked up

492
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:30,400
a breeder who's been using one male for

493
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,279
a variety of different females and so

494
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
um you know it's not uh it's not like

495
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,319
that makes those

496
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,600
those varieties useless or anything but

497
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,839
uh it's

498
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,918
uh it's it's it's interesting and it

499
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,558
shows uh some of the limitations of the

500
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,840
the current uh breeding techniques that

501
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,839
have been used

502
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,918
hopefully you guys can read that yeah so

503
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,319
there's an example of just a total

504
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,080
strain naming consistency so we have a

505
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,879
snoops dream sample that was picked up

506
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,720
from a dispensary in washington state

507
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,240
and that was that ended up being

508
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,480
genetically identical to

509
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,480
another variety that came out of

510
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,519

511
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,400
called blue dreams so i don't know which

512
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,798
one's which

513
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,720
or what was the original we can't say

514
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,480
that from those data point but

515
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,400
i looked it up on lethally snoop's dream

516
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,558
is supposed to be a hybrid between a

517
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,400
master kush and a blue dream

518
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,558
but so maybe it's the blue dream that's

519
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,759
mislabeled here in this case but

520
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,359
that's going to be the thing as we get

521
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,839
more and more samples we'll be able to

522
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,000
build

523
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,519
case studies on on some of these

524
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,798
inconsistencies and

525
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,240
go back and and hopefully

526
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,639
and hopefully clean up some of these

527
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,640
issues

528
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,279
and there's just another little uh

529
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,558
cluster issue there

530
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:53,359
so we have uh we have catatonic butane

531
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:54,558
uh bhutan and the catatonic ac dc

532
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,479
variety

533
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,160
those are all genetically identical

534
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,679
three different names

535
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
they all came uh two were from

536
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,559
california one where one was from

537
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,279
massachusetts

538
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:10,639
so i'm not sure what the original was

539
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:12,079
there either but well just

540
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640
i'll just leave you guys with this

541
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,240
little uh you know dream big here

542
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,720
so so this is something from pioneer

543
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,038
genetics and so what what this machine

544
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,960
is is the corn chipper and so they'll do

545
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,079
crosses this is a way to accelerate

546
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,200
breeding

547
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:30,720
improve strains novel traits

548
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,160
intragressed you can do crosses

549
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,079
dump the seeds in somewhere at the top

550
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,440
it's kind of cut out of the picture

551
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,759
labels each one rotates it around

552
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,400
takes a little cutting off of the embryo

553
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,798
the seed's still viable stores the seed

554
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,480
dna sequencing off of that little piece

555
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,558
that was removed

556
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,679
search for markers decide which ones

557
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,119
you're actually going to grow and do

558
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,280
field trials on

559
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:59,199
all automated you know genomic selection

560
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:02,319
marker selection so it's it's uh

561
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,519
obviously a work in progress but uh put

562
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:07,839
that on the

563
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:09,519
the wish list for your next grow

564
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,519
so just a quick summary there and

565
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,639
probably over the timeline here

566
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,918
so i think uh there's there's um you

567
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,440
know there's a lot of information you

568
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,200
can get out of dna sequencing and some

569
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,640
of it isn't interpretable but

570
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,519
some of it you can't really get

571
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,000
otherwise so it's important that

572
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,359
we consider these data but it's also

573
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,359
important that we don't

574
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,359
that we that we work together and we

575
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,199
blend these data and we layer them

576
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,639
so the genetic data without the chemical

577
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,279
data is

578
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,000
uh it's a little bit thin and together

579
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,839
they can make some really powerful tools

580
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,279
and so as we've uh we've heard in some

581
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,199
of these talks and some of the papers

582
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,200
that have come out recently there's

583
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,720
this number changes but i'm quoting a

584
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,558
113 different

585
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,640
phytocannabinoids have been identified

586
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,079
and at least 120

587
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,640
uh terpenoid compounds and so the caveat

588
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,558
there is

589
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,320
okay yeah it's found on the plant the

590
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,319
plant may not necessarily actually

591
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,439
synthesize all those as kevin brought up

592
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,240
there's

593
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,080
certainly the potential for some of the

594
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,720
alterations and the chemical structures

595
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,279
coming from

596
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,720
the microbiome but it's intriguing

597
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,839
nonetheless and

598
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,400
i think there's a lot of room for

599
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:25,599
improvement

600
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:25,600
thanks for listening
