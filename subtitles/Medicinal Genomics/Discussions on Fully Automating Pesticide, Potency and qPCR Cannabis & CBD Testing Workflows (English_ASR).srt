1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,599
good afternoon everybody thank you jeff

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,839
i understand i can kick off shortly

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
my name is toby astle i work for perkin

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,199
elmer i'm the global market manager for

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,760
cannabis and hemp

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,439
it's my job to listen to our clients to

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,279
understand the challenges they're facing

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,439
in testing cannabis and hemp

9
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:31,278
and hopefully deliver technologies and

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,880
the support to get better data quality

11
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,079
we're not a testing lab we're a

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,359
technology

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,200
provider

14
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,000
just by a quick show of hands in the

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
room

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,079
who is currently testing their own

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,039
cannabis or outsourcing their cannabis

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,039
to a third-party lab anybody in the room

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,280
all right so we're gonna we're gonna do

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,320
some science uh 101 probably in this

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
talk which is great

22
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,519
i'll probably keep this to be a little

23
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,519
shorter than 30 minutes but my goal here

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
is to show you some of the technologies

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,719
available to testing labs or quality

26
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,519
control labs to help get better data

27
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,519
quality in more time efficient manners

28
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,399
and ultimately what you heard jeff just

29
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,478
speak about is

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
understand where we can standardize some

31
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,519
of the testing

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,400
there's a lot of activities out there

33
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,399
but they're not always public

34
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:37,039
so we've all gathered in la um

35
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,640
coming from various continents and parts

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,560
of the country

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,879
as we know cannabis and hemp is an

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,759
exciting space for us to all be in there

39
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,359
are now global markets available for

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,840
both obviously some of them very

41
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,078
different to others but what we've seen

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,880
is our international team really embrace

43
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,679
this and share knowledge to deliver

44
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,039
answers faster than before

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,880
as a chemist

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,079
cannabis is one of the most challenging

47
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,319
matrices to test there's no plant that

48
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,799
is the same as its neighbor so that

49
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,229
presents challenges in the lab and now

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,640
we have seen a huge

51
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:15,359
[Music]

52
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:18,159
amount of a variety of products derived

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
from cannabis oil and hemp oil which in

54
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,359
itself can pose testing challenges once

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,959
it gets to the lab so our goal is to

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,640
understand what these

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,840
product types look like and how they

58
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,679
behave differently as they are tested

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,759
and provide guidance so that we can

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,680
generate better data so people can make

61
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,359
the right decisions particularly when it

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,360
comes to administrative medicine

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,080
what i'm going to talk to you today is

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,640
very much focused on the laboratory

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,519
environment but i think this

66
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,799
can be

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,400
looked at in other areas of the vertical

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,000
but what we'll look at today is

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,640
optimizing the core foundations in a lab

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,639
to generate good data and in my eyes

71
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,799
that looks like the three we see here

72
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,119
that's the choice of the soft goods the

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,360
reagents are consumables not all

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
suppliers are created equal

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
the instrumentation

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,000
some of these assays or state compliance

77
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,560
requirements are incredibly

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,598
demanding you need sensitive equipment

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,759
and instrumentation and lastly

80
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,158
cannabis labs are reaching a maturity

81
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,000
where we're seeing thousands of samples

82
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,199
being tested a month and that's

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,199
generating huge huge amounts of data and

84
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,359
ultimately as jeff just mentioned that

85
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,318
data needs to be made available if

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
needed

87
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:40,000
so managing that data in a timely and

88
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,759
qualified manner is important

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,759
and what i'll also say is particularly

90
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,199
as we come out of the pandemic

91
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,560
we've seen a lot of challenges around

92
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:51,280
the staffing or the personnel in labs

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,598
and there's been a lot of delays

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,479
ultimately getting samples processed or

95
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,479
data

96
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,919
produced because the staffing hasn't

97
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,679
been available

98
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,559
so what i like to add at the end is how

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,640
we've

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,878
adopted automation to take some of the

101
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,518
burden off the staff

102
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,919
and generate quality data in a timely

103
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,920
manner

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,239
as i mentioned cannabis is a complex

105
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,879
matrix and it's full of fats chlorophyll

106
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,279
terpenes cannabinoids and contaminants

107
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,439
like heavy metals and pesticides

108
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,359
so as a scientist it's it's key to

109
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,759
really understand what's going to maybe

110
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,280
catch you up in the lab or work with a

111
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,360
partner that's already encountered and

112
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,359
developed methodologies to overcome them

113
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,918
but we know testing is essential and

114
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,000
depending on what market you're focused

115
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,959
on or what you're looking into we know

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,879
it's key and core to generating a safe

117
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,439
product for the consumer both in the

118
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,040
medicinal and in the recreational market

119
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,279
and it's not hard to look at some of the

120
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,160
press releases or the media or the data

121
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,399
available to show that bad samples are

122
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,320
out there and it's the responsibility of

123
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,279
the industry to accept that testing is

124
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,399
essential and empower the labs to

125
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,799
be able to do that effectively and it's

126
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,679
an exciting time for us to understand

127
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,918
how these regulatory requirements differ

128
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,879
and support each of them in the various

129
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:14,879
states and countries

130
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,719
what i will focus on for the next few

131
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,478
minutes is the pesticide and mycotoxin

132
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,400
testing requirements in cannabis and

133
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,199
hemp and depending on where you're

134
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,319
coming from or what you're testing this

135
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,120
is a patchwork of requirements and as

136
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,599
you can see for pesticides and cannabis

137
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,319
in all the markets across the us they

138
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,140
have different regulatory requirements

139
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,478
so

140
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,399
[Music]

141
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,879
you may think you have it easier in a

142
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,279
state that has a lower number of total

143
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,199
analytes however the detection

144
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,719
requirements of those could be quite a

145
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,120
lot lower than say california so really

146
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,919
a lot of time has to be spent on these

147
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,439
methods and as a new lab that's not

148
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,839
ideal you want to be generating coas so

149
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,000
we've taken that responsibility on and

150
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,079
developed these methodologies fit for

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,160
purpose for these various state markets

152
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,439
and we'll focus on california because it

153
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,680
does still to this day have one of the

154
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,680
most comprehensive lists in the industry

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,399
but before we get to the instrumentation

156
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,599
i just want to take a step back and we

157
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,918
have a number of discussions in the

158
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,400
field where ultimately the data isn't

159
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,240
what the lab or the client expected

160
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,239
and what this means is there needs to be

161
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,000
a robust quality control or compliance

162
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,600
framework in that lab to understand

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,879
where potentially an error was

164
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,879
introduced

165
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,639
and this isn't for any not this isn't

166
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,879
just for cannabis labs this is for all

167
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,199
labs in general and what we can see is

168
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,918
that a huge amount of time

169
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,598
is associated with preparing the sample

170
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,120
for the analysis

171
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,000
and this is where we see a lot of

172
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,038
cumbersome steps typically done by

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,680
inexperienced personnel and a small slip

174
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,719
at the beginning can have a significant

175
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,720
impact on the final data result

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,560
so what we've done is looked at this

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
workflow taken one of the most

178
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,399
challenging assays to date which is

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,840
pesticide analysis and try to improve

180
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:25,758
the lab's chances of success by bringing

181
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,758
technology to their lab

182
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,639
and if we look at the incumbent or the

183
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,399
legacy scenario for sample preparation

184
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,560
what we see as

185
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,758
the norm is

186
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,800
labs having to utilize a large

187
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,800
number of suppliers to meet their soft

188
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,000
goods needs they need to

189
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,520
source reagents consumables labware for

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,720
multiple vendors and then they also have

191
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,758
to spend considerable time on the bench

192
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,520
preparing mixing diluting transcribing

193
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,199
recording inventory and this for a busy

194
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,240
lab can take up a significant amount of

195
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,160
time

196
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,840
so we saw this paradigm and wanted to

197
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,840
change it and what we were able to do

198
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,599
is put all those steps into one kit take

199
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,240
a lot of the heavy lifting and the wet

200
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,478
chemistry that's typically done

201
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,720
in that sample preparation procedure and

202
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,598
do that at the factory so that now we

203
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,520
can supply an iso so it's a certified

204
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,439
reference material regarding kit to

205
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,478
cannabis labs so they have more

206
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,279
confidence

207
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,038
in the calibration and the quality

208
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,799
control standards they're going to use

209
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,479
for the final determination and

210
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,799
we've seen

211
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,038
a lot of interest in making lives easier

212
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,199
and starting with the reagents which are

213
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,600
instrument agnostic has been it's been a

214
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,640
great step forward for us and i'm happy

215
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,040
to talk about this offline at the booth

216
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,919
after my talk

217
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,319
but what i'll say is we've tried to

218
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:59,120
aggregate all the pesticide and

219
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,839
microtoxin

220
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,399
requirements in this one kit for the u.s

221
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,880
and currently we have 77 pesticides and

222
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,360
five microtoxins down to one parts per

223
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,559
billion all the way up to 250 parts per

224
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
billion so

225
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,039
if you look at your state requirements

226
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,040
and see that it includes uh all or some

227
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,360
of these pesticides you know you can use

228
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,159
this kit out of the box with really no

229
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,959
prep time to improve your data quality

230
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,199
and improve your lab efficiencies

231
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,799
we also have included

232
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,120
internal standards and for those that

233
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,919
maybe aren't as familiar because of the

234
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,839
challenging matrix cannabis is we often

235
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,719
use a number of analytical techniques to

236
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,040
improve the data quality or understand

237
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,639
where we'll see suppression effects from

238
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,120
the matrix and one of those that we

239
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,199
suggest and recommend is the use of

240
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,320
internal standards which are similar

241
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,080
molecules but they are isotopely labeled

242
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,320
so they're a little bit heavier in their

243
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,160
mass so you can identify them more

244
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,080
specifically in the assay and account

245
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,079
for any fluctuations in that test

246
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,360
and again this is ready to use out of

247
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,439
the box

248
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,278
and i'm excited to see the feedback from

249
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,279
various labs that have struggled in the

250
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,679
past in getting their reagent prep

251
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:11,679
correct

252
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,839
no

253
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,078
no lab is equal however we've summarized

254
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,200
the time savings from a kit like this

255
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,159
and you see

256
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,480
up to 90 plus minutes of time savings so

257
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,919
in a busy lab environment running 500

258
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,278
samples a week

259
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,799
this ends up

260
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,720
helping them out a lot and getting

261
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:35,278
through to more important steps like

262
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,278
data review or coa confirmation

263
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,639
and together with our instrumentation

264
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,480
we're excited to provide the complete

265
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,480
workflow i'm not going to get into the

266
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,639
instrument per se but

267
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,879
we have established these verified

268
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,958
methods that work side by side with the

269
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,278
reagents and the hardware to meet the

270
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,479
testing needs in cannabis and hemp

271
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,320
and uh

272
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,000
we're very confident in the method and i

273
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,240
want to be able to demonstrate that

274
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,200
where possible we participate in the

275
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,440
emerald proficiency test yearly and last

276
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,560
year received our 2021 badge for this

277
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,200
assay

278
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,199
in particular

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,958
so what i was mentioning earlier is that

280
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,680
we're seeing

281
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,359
a maturity and the volumes across the us

282
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,599
and in canada

283
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,959
get to be quite sizable for labs trying

284
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,278
to handle thousands of samples per month

285
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,679
having cannabis being deemed essential

286
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,278
during the pandemic has only increased

287
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,879
the number of samples that have needed

288
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,559
to be tested

289
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,838
so it's an exciting time to be a

290
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,439
scientist in the space as every day new

291
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,760
samples new product types are being

292
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,480
manufactured and sold and they have to

293
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,559
be tested appropriately

294
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,320
but we saw this as being a challenge

295
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,319
because as i mentioned uh during the

296
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,640
pandemic in particular labs were

297
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,959
struggling to find the right personnel

298
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,439
or the right amount of personnel and

299
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:56,078
they were really looking to leverage

300
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,160
anything to get them ahead of the sample

301
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,120
preparation uh challenges they were

302
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,719
seeing

303
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,480
perk and elm is a big company we do a

304
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,639
lot of work in the diagnostics clinical

305
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,879
side of the world and we're able to

306
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,278
leverage a very mature automation

307
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,439
platform and develop something specific

308
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,958
for cannabis labs so i've been working

309
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,560
with labs in the team for the last year

310
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,199
and a half and i'm very excited to be

311
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:20,000
able to provide a fully autonomous

312
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,560
workflow to cannabis labs now so before

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,879
they may have had two three four people

314
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,000
preparing samples preparing reagents

315
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,120
that can be now replaced by a machine an

316
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,720
instrument

317
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,039
and i'll share some slides on what it

318
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
does shortly but we know that if we can

319
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,799
take some of the human influence or

320
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,278
human error out of the workflow the data

321
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,519
quality is likely going to go up

322
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,039
and it's going to be far more consistent

323
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,200
the instrument doesn't get hung over it

324
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,679
doesn't get tied it does the same thing

325
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,160
every day day in and day out

326
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,078
and this development we believe is going

327
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,360
to be important for the sustainability

328
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,359
of cannabis and hemp testing

329
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,559
but we wanted to make sure we weren't

330
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,719
just

331
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,078
tackling the hard goods so we have the

332
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,680
instrumentation now we have the

333
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,958
automation but that data is essential

334
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,120
in

335
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,439
maintaining the credibility of that

336
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,879
result and also communicating that data

337
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,720
to the client or the lab manager so we

338
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,838
looked at this holistically and realized

339
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,360
we needed to develop software to

340
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,440
communicate digitally between each

341
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,680
platform in the workflow and that starts

342
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,200
with weighing the sample on the balance

343
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,199
you'll talk to a number of labs where

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
they'll tell you that oh yeah we wrote

345
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
down the wrong way that has a massive

346
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,680
cascade into the quality of the data at

347
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,720
the end so to now take the data off that

348
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,599
balance

349
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,360
automatically at with the right value

350
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,920
offers a lot more security in that lab

351
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,919
workflow

352
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,920
and just to summarize what the platform

353
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
does

354
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,759
if you've been around a cannabis testing

355
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,639
lab for pesticide and microtoxins you

356
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,958
will have seen samples be homogenized

357
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,399
extracted

358
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:03,518
centrifuged vortexed filtered diluted

359
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,198
all very manual steps up until now but

360
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,360
they can now be accommodated on this

361
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,000
platform and the idea is you put your

362
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,399
flower sample in at the beginning press

363
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,120
go and you come back and take your small

364
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,120
lcms file off at the end and run the

365
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,198
quantitation after that and our

366
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,639
turnaround time is about 48 samples in

367
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,240
two hours so

368
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,079
we're very um

369
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,839
happy uh as we're seeing that being a

370
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:30,919
lot faster than what it typically takes

371
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,920
labs to prepare that amount manually

372
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,560
and just a quick snapshot on the data

373
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,958
this is just showing the reproducibility

374
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,719
of of the automation uh it's far more

375
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,239
consistent than a human

376
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,680
which which gives us the confidence to

377
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,519
meet some of the stringent state

378
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,039
regulatory requirements that are in

379
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,039
place for cannabis and hemp testing

380
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,120
and again we know that every state has a

381
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,198
different testing requirement so it was

382
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
important for us to make sure you're

383
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,399
running the technology on the right

384
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,039
application to meet the right

385
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,639
requirements this is just a summary of

386
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,879
the various states and some of the

387
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,639
differences in their action limits some

388
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,720
are higher some are lower but

389
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,320
collectively we can support all these as

390
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,079
needed in your market

391
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,959
and this is just an eye chart but this

392
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,838
gives you the data for the california

393
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,000
list

394
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,480
showing that we can successfully use an

395
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,600
automation platform to meet the dcc's

396
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,600
requirements in a busy lab

397
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:32,078
and i focused on pesticide and

398
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:34,399
microtoxins but we appreciate that

399
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,719
a busy cannabis and hemp lab is going to

400
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,919
have a number of workflows or testing

401
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,240
assays that could also be automated

402
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,958
we have had a lot of success looking at

403
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,720
the molecular qpcr prep using a similar

404
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,719
platform as they just mentioned

405
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,240
we can work with the kit providers like

406
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,160
medicinal genomics

407
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,000
and the qpcr instrumentation providers

408
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,838
to integrate that automation into the

409
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,639
software as well

410
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,639
for myself on the platform i just showed

411
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,120
we are automating the pesticide and

412
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,440
microtoxin and now the potency prep

413
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,959
shortly this summer so giving labs a lot

414
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,360
more

415
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:13,679
options into improving their throughput

416
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,680
and their workflows uh with technology

417
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,839
and lastly i just want to touch on

418
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,679
software um those that went to grad

419
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,440
school or those have been around labs

420
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,519
recognized lab notebooks being stacked

421
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,519
to the ceilings and we know that in a

422
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,879
compliance environment that's not ideal

423
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,720
or really

424
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,559
um allowed so we took a lot of the work

425
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
we've done in the farmer and the food in

426
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,439
the nutraceutical space and looked at

427
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,959
the frameworks for iso gmp

428
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
compliant environments that are now

429
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,198
being required in certain cannabis

430
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:46,319
markets iso being the more predominant

431
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,479
one in the us gmp being very common now

432
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,480
in canada but we were able to use that

433
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,800
framework and apply it to the state

434
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,120
specifics of cannabis and hemp

435
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:59,439
to deliver a software that now manages

436
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,600
and controls access to that data

437
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,519
this is a software as a service from

438
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,880
perkinalmer so this is a cloud-based

439
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
software that really starts at the

440
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,880
beginning where you can take your order

441
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,640
entry look at your inventory your

442
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,199
samples you need to process that day and

443
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,759
then follow that data completely through

444
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,759
the workflow to the final certificate of

445
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,759
analysis

446
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,639
and

447
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,759
we've looked at the entire regulatory

448
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,919
requirements

449
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,679
which is typically four or five

450
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,759
chemistry assays

451
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,360
one microbial assay and then foreign

452
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,279
matter moisture

453
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,639
and included those workflows in the

454
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,639
software so

455
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,640
you may or may not have instrument

456
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,240
already if you do have instrumentation

457
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,320
already you can work with the prokaryo

458
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,880
software to improve the data transfer

459
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,879
across your lab

460
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,240
the certificate of analysis and the

461
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,480
reports have been developed to be

462
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,480
configurable however we started with our

463
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,558
best attempt at looking at that specific

464
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,400
state requirement looking at the font

465
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,918
size the colors that have to be used so

466
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,360
that you are

467
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,280
going to be in a good position to submit

468
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,240
your data for the state

469
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,240
for it to be approved

470
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,160
and lastly

471
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,400
we're very excited about the science

472
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,600
in cannabis and hemp and helping labs

473
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,640
across the globe get or

474
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,558
produce better quality data so that the

475
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,679
right decisions could be made for these

476
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,119
markets

477
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,280
and what that looks like from our team

478
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,719
is having a dedicated cannabis team that

479
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,839
starts at the very beginning on the

480
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,000
installation of any instrument

481
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,319
we perform a specific cannabis

482
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,640
suitability test so we know that the

483
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,159
matrix you're trying to test ultimately

484
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000
is the one that

485
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,240
is being validated by us

486
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,038
and then we train with a dedicated

487
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
cannabis application team and uh let you

488
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,079
obviously go through the validation

489
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,400
process yourself um but then you're in a

490
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,240
position to to run client samples and

491
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,000
generate coas

492
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,000
and people like myself and the extended

493
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,798
team are always available

494
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,558
to

495
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:59,918
listen understand challenges or

496
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,879
opportunities where we can always work

497
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,880
together in the field

498
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,399
if you'd like to learn more please stop

499
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,359
by the booth or check us out on social

500
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,200
media

501
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,959
we are global we have a very strong

502
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,960
presence in the u.s i'd love to

503
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,120
introduce you to the local parking

504
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,440
number representative

505
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,639
and for those that like virtual reality

506
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,519
we have a new

507
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,720
