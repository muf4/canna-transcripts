1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,878
my name's michael levinson i'm a trial

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,679
attorney i usually speak to about 12

3
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,439
people right in front of me

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,040
uh so i'm going to imagine that there

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,199
are 12 people right in front of me right

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,559
now or everybody can move to the middle

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,679
either way

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,399
how many doctors do we have here

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,439
how many lawyers do we have here

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,799
okay

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,800
reason i do that is because when i do a

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,118
trial i usually i know a little bit

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,839
about the jury before i start talking to

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,839
them

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,600
i had thought about different ways to do

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,119
this and i think what i finally decided

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,039
on

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,119
not i don't think what i finally decided

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,359
on i know what i finally decided on and

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,679
i'm going to get my timer started so i

21
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,679
know exactly how much time i'm taking

22
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,719
uh

23
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,558
is

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,960
in simple terms

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,718
uh everybody remember the glamour

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,799
magazine back in the i think it started

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,520
maybe in the 70s the 80s used to have

28
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,599
the glamour fashion do's

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,920
and the fashion don'ts

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,840
so there were glamour do's and don'ts

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,359
well we're going to touch on some of the

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,920
more important medical legal cannabis

33
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,079
do's and don'ts

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,118
there's your glamour magazine

35
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,920
so

36
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,200
when it comes to fashion a dew as an

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,759
example

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,320
is always considered basic black for

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,560
formal affair never go wrong wasn't it

40
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,639
was coco and chanel or someone who'd

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,478
invented the the little black dress and

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,439
it's never failed anybody in a formal

43
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,840
affair

44
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,279
that's a do

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,520
this is a don't

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,640
don't do whatever this is supposed to be

47
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,478
i have i couldn't figure it out between

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,478
my wife and my friends nobody knew what

49
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,799
this was but everybody knew it was a

50
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:46,798
don't

51
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,280
the basic considerations for a doctor if

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,478
you're going to be recommending medical

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,079
cannabis

54
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,879
it really depends on what state you're

55
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,919
in

56
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,879
uh california is very kind of loose

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,840
so in california excuse me there are

58
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,078
several

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,079
listed conditions by the way

60
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,038
of the doctors here who were in

61
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,439
california

62
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,119
okay how many no doc no california

63
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,359
doctors how many obviously everybody

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,878
else is from another state

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
well the first thing you really need to

66
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:19,840
do is you need to make sure that you

67
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
know the rules in your state because

68
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,239
they really do vary in california the

69
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
first medical marijuana state

70
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
the rule was

71
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,239
the the way that it was put into

72
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,560
existence was through a voter initiative

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,200
called the compassionate use act and it

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,920
listed several conditions aids glaucoma

75
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,000
et cetera et cetera or any condition for

76
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,799
which marijuana provides relief which

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,280
was pretty vague

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,640
other states is very strict okay and so

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,959
you have to very much know what your

80
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,399
state rules are or you can run into

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,840
trouble and that's the whole point of my

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,879
talk is so that you don't run into

83
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,479
trouble

84
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,919
what kind of history and exam is

85
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,280
required these are the questions you

86
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,878
need to think about if you're going to

87
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,719
be doing this

88
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,959
in california now

89
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,519
the medical board does not have specific

90
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,439
requirements but it does require or does

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
recommend strongly

92
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,519
that you get medical records at least

93
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,518
relating to the condition for which

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,319
cannabis use is being sought

95
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,080
so if somebody says that they i i'll

96
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,560
disclose that i have a little bit of

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,400
pulse rate of colitis right so when i

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,239
went to the doctor to get a

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,439
recommendation for cannabis they said

100
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
what's your condition i said i have

101
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,158
ulcerative colitis they said that's fine

102
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,238
have your gi doc send me some records

103
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,878
uh that's basic you really need to do

104
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,039
that and if you think that if you think

105
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,399
that i'm telling you that because people

106
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,079
already know that

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,799
uh there's a lot of doctors that maybe

108
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,480
know it but they aren't doing it and

109
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,799
they're running into trouble for that so

110
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,479
you don't want that kind of trouble

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,080
what kind of cannabis would work best

112
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,598
for your patient

113
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,959
um well

114
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,598
i mean that's what seminars like this

115
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,360
are for i can't certainly tell anybody

116
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,878
really about that i mean i've had enough

117
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,159
exposure to this industry for long

118
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:01,919
enough i probably have some pretty good

119
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,598
idea but

120
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,919
you come to seminars you communicate

121
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,079
with other doctors there's literature

122
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,919
but it's not all the same i mean

123
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
you know the time was you know when i

124
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,598
was first litigating cases of this kind

125
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,119
the whole you know marijuana it's all

126
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,000
just marijuana how could that help

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,319
anybody well that that ship is long

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,800
since sailed that it's a it's really a

129
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,599
designer drug and there's various kinds

130
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,400
uh excuse me that last speaker i had a

131
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
chance to speak with her before today i

132
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,079
mean they're literally and they're and

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360
in the uh uh

134
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,758
you know exhibit hall where the

135
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,000
companies are you know selling their

136
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,879
wares they're selling genetic tests to

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
match

138
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,279
the patient to the drugs that they're

139
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,199
going to use and that's being done

140
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,799
already and some other kinds of medicine

141
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,478
and it will certainly be done in medical

142
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,639
cannabis

143
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,560
when it comes to quantities what very

144
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,439
and i say very general and the reason

145
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,280
for that is dosing dosing is like the

146
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,240
one of the biggest issues

147
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,000
and it's a tricky problem for doctors

148
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,079
both medically and legally and the

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,079
reason for that is because

150
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,758
you can't really prescribe it in the

151
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,918
same way that you do other medicines

152
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,000
because you don't really know when that

153
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,519
person you don't know when you write a

154
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,319
script for

155
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,159
50 milligrams of whatever it is and they

156
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,000
take it down to the pharmacy you know

157
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,120
what they're getting okay you know that

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,560
they're getting

159
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,759
the medicine that you've prescribed for

160
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
them you can't really know that when

161
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,038
they go down to a medical cannabis

162
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,038
dispensary you can have some idea a

163
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,240
pretty good idea now that they've honed

164
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,120
the medical

165
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
uh

166
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,120
production so you have six to one and

167
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,120
four to one and so on but you also don't

168
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,240
have the analytical data that you would

169
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,759
otherwise have it just doesn't exist so

170
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
you have to be

171
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,759
very careful about talking about dosing

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,839
and i'm going to probably say this two

173
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,680
or three times as i go along but one of

174
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,719
the things that you

175
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,120
for sure

176
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,039
want to be careful about saying is that

177
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,199
this is what i think you should do

178
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,279
it's better to say this is what i have

179
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
found through my patients or my

180
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,359
experience with my patients to have

181
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,879
worked for them

182
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,439
and that makes it which is if true is

183
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,360
really what you are saying anyway

184
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,399
but you need to be very careful about

185
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,720
how you word your medical orders or your

186
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,318
medical advice

187
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,479
will i ever have to go to court to back

188
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,479
this up well you know let's hope you

189
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,360
don't but you always have to be thinking

190
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,279
about that because you may need to go

191
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,879
into court somebody that you have

192
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,079
recommended cannabis to could get

193
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,719
arrested

194
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,318
or i've had this happen where i've had

195
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,160
to represent parents who had their

196
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,080
children taken away

197
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
because a doctor recommended cannabis

198
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,120
for their child the child was

199
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,279
smelled like it at school

200
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,598
the children were taken away luckily

201
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,119
they got to me we got the case beat

202
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,199
pretty fast

203
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,439
but that's not an experience that that

204
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
parent will soon forget and it was a

205
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,279
protract once we got them back into the

206
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,038
home pretty much right away it was about

207
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,598
a two months protracted legal battle

208
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:06,318
that cost some good deal of money and

209
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,240
uh you know untold amount of stress and

210
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,360
that's not you know something you want

211
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,598
to deal with

212
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,439
that that particular scenario will come

213
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,918
up a couple more times in my talk but

214
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,680
the gist of it is if you're going to say

215
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,000
something to a patient and recommend a

216
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,680
can a cannabis treatment to them

217
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,519
you should you have to keep in the back

218
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,439
your mind somebody may ask you about

219
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,680
this one day and you may want you may

220
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,000
need to show why you did this why you

221
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,879
did it the way that you did it how much

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,439
when who etcetera

223
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,399
uh well er well will i ever have to

224
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:41,360
justify my actions to the medical board

225
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:44,638
and let's hope not but you might

226
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,160
um in california currently in order to

227
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,280
recommend cannabis what you're supposed

228
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,199
to be

229
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,198
is you you are now required to consider

230
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,520
yourself the attending physician which

231
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,080
means you are taking primary care

232
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,159
primary responsibility for the patient's

233
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,079
care at least as it relates to their use

234
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
of medical cannabis

235
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,878
uh that doesn't mean you have to treat

236
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,720
them for everything it doesn't mean you

237
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,479
have to be on call for them 24 hours a

238
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,639
day it means

239
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,800
that you are responsible for their use

240
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,960
of cannabis and for being able to

241
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
explain to the medical board why for

242
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,839
example

243
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,919
uh

244
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,918
this schizophrenic patient that you

245
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,839
didn't get the records for

246
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,159
and didn't really inquire into then

247
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,839
wound up having all of these problems

248
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,280
because you didn't pay attention to the

249
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,839
fact that you probably shouldn't

250
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,839
recommend cannabis to a schizophrenic

251
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,158
uh that's a problem that three of my

252
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,838
clients have had before they got to me

253
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,838
so that's something you want to pay

254
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,279
attention to

255
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,839
okay that's something you want to pay

256
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,838
attention to

257
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,278
do remember we're doing the dues and the

258
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,519
don'ts this is a medical cannabis dude

259
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,838
do get sufficient medical records before

260
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,320
evaluating a patient you would think

261
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,320
that that would be just

262
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
you know der-riguer right nobody would

263
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,600
ever think about not doing that and you

264
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,278
would be wrong

265
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
uh you can now

266
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,159
very easily

267
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,319
this is well

268
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,319
you can walk into some dispensaries that

269
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,120
sell the cannabis in the state you can

270
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,120
do plink plink plink on an ipad that

271
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,639
they have in the front lobby and then

272
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,320
you will going back and they'll say did

273
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,679
you get approved and they'll go plink

274
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
plink plink and you will have been

275
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,519
approved you'll have never spoken to

276
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,039
anyone you'll have produced no medical

277
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,360
records you will have done nothing more

278
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,240
than show them your driver's license

279
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,159
okay

280
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,959
there's a word for that

281
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,719
illegal okay all of that

282
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,799
is illegal and it's being done now you

283
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,080
might ask well ha how do they do it how

284
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,479
do they get away with that if it's

285
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,320
illegal well you know i mean i drove

286
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,720
down here from the bay area

287
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,120
on late monday and i was going about 85

288
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,120
miles an hour i didn't get a ticket well

289
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,720
why you know just not enough cops to

290
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,959
catch everybody that's speeding and it's

291
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,200
sort of the same thing in this business

292
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,958
they just don't police it that tightly

293
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,440
and nobody really reports these things

294
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,278
the way that they should i suppose and

295
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,600
so that's what happens

296
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,720
excuse me

297
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,360
don't

298
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,440
don't tell your patient a list of

299
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,120
complaints that would qualify and tell

300
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
them to pick one

301
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
okay

302
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,240
i have had two doctors as patients who

303
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,200
did that excuse me as clients who did

304
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,639
that

305
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,959
somebody came into their office they

306
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,278
said you know i really don't

307
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,039
want to use i don't really you know have

308
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,958
a medical problem i just want to get an

309
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,519
excuse that i can use medical care or i

310
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,759
can use cannabis i can smoke marijuana

311
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,799
okay now that was before

312
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,720
uh prop 64 which made it a lot easier if

313
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,879
you're over 21

314
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,639
to use cannabis you can just buy it you

315
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,039
can possess it you don't have to have a

316
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,838
medical excuse for it

317
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,240
but

318
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,839
uh you can still run into this problem

319
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,120
with someone who's between the ages of

320
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,880
18 and 21 in this state and and in any

321
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,278
other state they still have to have a

322
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,159
genuinely qualifying condition right

323
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,000
well

324
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,600
what happened in these two cases

325
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,799
essentially somebody told the doctor

326
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,320
look i don't really have anything wrong

327
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,319
with me i just want to be able to use

328
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,000
cannabis and i said well look the doctor

329
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,399
said well look i can't

330
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,159
give you a recommendation unless you

331
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
tell me there so here here's the list

332
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,519
just point to one and we'll write it up

333
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,720
that way

334
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,560
now that doctor did that twice

335
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,040
and then the third time and the fourth

336
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,479
time and the fifth time that he did it

337
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,159
the people that he did it to were

338
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,240
undercover investigators for the

339
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,039
california medical board

340
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,879
and he was then brought before the board

341
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,519
very serious charges

342
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,120
they had this all recorded okay because

343
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,959
they were wearing a wire when they were

344
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,240
in his office

345
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,679
there were different people they were

346
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
very convincing they're very good at

347
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,479
this

348
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,920
and

349
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
he ran into some trouble he didn't

350
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,599
remain my client

351
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,838
throughout the entire process because he

352
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
was quite indignant about

353
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,360
the thing that he was frankly most

354
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,680
indignant about was the fact that they

355
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,440
had recorded him inside of his office

356
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,120
how could they do that this is a private

357
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,600
medical consultation

358
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,000
this is a violation of my rights and

359
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,079
their privacy and so on and so forth

360
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,919
and the only answer to that is yeah but

361
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,319
how else would they catch somebody doing

362
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,519
this without recording

363
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,639
excuse me he was this was a you know

364
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,078
basically

365
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,720
what my grandmother would have called me

366
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,638
suga and he just couldn't

367
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,200
get it and he wanted running into some

368
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,959
serious problems but the point being

369
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,959
don't do that or don't do anything

370
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,479
similar to that just find out what's

371
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,239
wrong with them if they can say and if

372
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,240
you feel that there's sufficient records

373
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,159
to support it and if you feel that it's

374
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,159
appropriate then you can recommend

375
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,639
cannabis

376
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,480
do start by recommending the least

377
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,240
amount necessary to relieve symptoms

378
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,600
correct correct me if i'm wrong is that

379
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,720
not

380
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,759
the basic medical rule for uh

381
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,839
prescribing medicine how much do i do

382
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,278
well if you're not sure the least amount

383
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
necessary with the least amount

384
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,439
necessary to relieve symptoms

385
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,519
start i guess i don't know whether it's

386
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,160
visible there start low

387
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,679
and go slow is what it's supposed to say

388
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,879
there and i think that is

389
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,199
that is generally the rule and

390
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,399
particularly when it comes to cannabis

391
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,920
because

392
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,278
again even if you know now if you can

393
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,199
know that you're recommending a four to

394
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,879
one or a six to one oil or something

395
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,639
like that

396
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,000
you don't know exactly how much they're

397
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,079
using it you don't know the regular

398
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,559
basis that they're using it on and

399
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,559
there's the i mean the overarching

400
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,559
scientific problems i guess with

401
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,319
recommending cannabis or the reason it

402
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,399
can't really be prescribed traditionally

403
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,240
is there are there far too many

404
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,440
variables to know

405
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,440
which of the variables is is at play in

406
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,519
changing the patient's condition either

407
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
to the positive or to the negative

408
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,480
because you don't know for sure which

409
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,399
one of the multiple variables in the

410
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,440
chemical itself let alone their

411
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,559
variables are affecting this so rather

412
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,240
than

413
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,919
the the simplest way to deal with that

414
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
problem is to just

415
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,559
titrate

416
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,720
small

417
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,919
increments and see what changes you get

418
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,480
and then

419
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,799
evaluate and that requires infinitely

420
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,639
more work than most of the doctors that

421
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,319
i know unfortunately and have dealt with

422
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,600
in this business

423
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,920
there are

424
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
some very very good ones and what they

425
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
do is they're in constant communication

426
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,599
with their patient emails telephone

427
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,399
calls it's a lot of work to do this

428
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,440
right and and it's not just a matter of

429
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,278
you know

430
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
taking the

431
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,958
money with the left hand and handing the

432
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,519
letter with the right hand and then

433
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,958
saying see you later which is what many

434
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,799
of these unfortunately many of these

435
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,039
businesses still do at least in this

436
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:37,359
state

437
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:39,679
okay don't don't use a pre-printed form

438
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,000
this particular doctor right was the

439
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,078
doctor for a client of mine

440
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,240
who got in trouble for how much he was

441
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,719
growing this is recent this is the kind

442
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,079
of thing that used to happen before prop

443
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,600
64 all the time and it's still happening

444
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,519
in a different way these are not

445
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,560
currently charged generally as crimes in

446
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,360
california this is a civil uh violation

447
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,198
with this gentleman as being excuse me

448
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,600
they're trying to get multiple thousands

449
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,599
of fines against him for how many plants

450
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,278
he grew but if you see at the top it

451
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,879
says he got a 99 plant recommendation

452
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,838
and he can it can have a certain amount

453
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,078
of weight okay that's a big big

454
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,079
don't you can't do that

455
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,479
because first off you're not an expert

456
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,559
in cultivation second you don't know

457
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,639
what strain is this person is growing

458
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,799
you don't know how large these plants

459
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,560
are et cetera et cetera there's so many

460
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,519
things that you simply cannot and do not

461
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,758
know

462
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,278
that you cannot write it that way not

463
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,480
there there's a whole

464
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,720
legal explanation for the 99 plant

465
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,440
letter which was sort of like the big

466
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,519
deal in the in the between about 2004

467
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,040
and about 2016.

468
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,560
uh excuse me that that was all

469
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,639
it's not worth the time to explain it

470
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,638
was all sort of this way to kind of do

471
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,198
this little dipsy do around federal law

472
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,839
and state law and medical cannabis

473
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,159
uh it doesn't never work

474
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,240
now the other problem this is this is a

475
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,198
don't i'm gonna give you a i guess a

476
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,440
double don't off of this one which is

477
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,198
that 99 plant recommendation that was a

478
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
pre-printed form when i asked the doctor

479
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,000
about it i said so why did you write a

480
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,680
recommendation for 99 plants and she

481
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,320
said i didn't write it we had two forms

482
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,519
there was the 50 plant one and the 99

483
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,440
plant one

484
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:32,720
the 50 plant one that's 145 bucks

485
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,639
the 99 plant one that's 245 bucks okay

486
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,240
now there's a word for that

487
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:41,120
what's the word illegal okay

488
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,120
very illegal you go to the doctor

489
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,320
i if i had some shoulder surgery a

490
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,078
couple years ago if i'd have gone to the

491
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,879
doctor see doc you know my it's a lot of

492
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:48,239
pain

493
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,879
can you get me something for it and he

494
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,399
says well listen i can get you the 25

495
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,320
milligram one week oxycontin

496
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,320
that's the hundred bucks but if you want

497
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,399
to go full bore you you want to really

498
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,320
roll with this thing you want the 50

499
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,599
milligram you want three weeks that's

500
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,160
250 okay there's a word for that

501
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,838
illegal very illegal and

502
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,319
this doctor when i spoke to her about

503
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,918
this was absolutely flabbergasted she

504
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,519
this is what she told me when i had and

505
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,959
this was recent this

506
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,720
that kind of thing right there that was

507
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,439
a little more common

508
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,679
10 years ago maybe right

509
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,279
i asked her i said you know we were

510
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,959
discussing this and i said well look you

511
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,720
know i mean you really i don't know if i

512
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,519
can use you as a witness because now you

513
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,759
have

514
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,038
a fifth amendment problem if you testify

515
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,000
to what you did there you'll be

516
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:35,759
admitting

517
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,720
if you your truthful testimony is the

518
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,319
admission of a crime okay i'm not saying

519
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,079
you're a criminal i'm just saying i

520
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,000
can't as a lawyer i have to advise you

521
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,519
about that you'll have to get counsel if

522
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
i'm going to call you as a witness she

523
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,759
said really everybody does this which is

524
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,759
all this is common practice in the

525
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,679
medical business in this state

526
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,038
and i was like well okay well you know

527
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,400
it's like what did your grandmother tell

528
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,839
you just because everybody else is

529
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,120

554
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,000
when they have a legal issue

555
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:52,960
the client that i was telling you about

556
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,640
whose

557
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
children were taken away

558
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,759
the doctor that recommended cannabis to

559
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,240
her

560
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,400
for her daughter who was autistic was an

561
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,480
orthopedist who was moonlighting as a

562
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,160
medical cannabis doctor writing letters

563
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,279
for i don't know how much a pop i never

564
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,200
asked him that

565
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,038
it took me

566
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,279
for calls to just have him get on the

567
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,079
phone with me and explain what why he

568
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,160
did this and what he had done but

569
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,558
one of the reasons that this mom's

570
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,640
children were taken away was because the

571
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,480
child protective service when this was

572
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,400
going on before they took the children

573
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
away called him

574
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,240
four times

575
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,240
never picked up never responded to their

576
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,839
calls okay so they just figured out he's

577
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,599
a schlockmeister we're not going to do

578
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,199
it we're not going to worry about this

579
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,719
and so then they wrote

580
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,558
in their affidavit

581
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,079
for taking the children

582
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,000
the warrant that they got to take the

583
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,079
children they said that she had not

584
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,079
consulted with a medical professional

585
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,720
even though they had a written

586
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,399
copy of the recommendation letter they

587
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,759
assumed they just said later in court

588
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,679
they thought it was fake they didn't you

589
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,119
know the doctor never followed through

590
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,519
never called called them etc okay not to

591
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,199
mention excuse me just as a

592
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,599
as an aside this is the number one

593
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,120
complaint when it comes to lawyers

594
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,879
and doctors in that sense are probably

595
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,000
not terribly much just different in this

596
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,080
regard

597
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,759
the number one complaint for since i've

598
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,879
been practicing law every time i go to

599
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,879
one of the

600
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,640
continuing legal education

601
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,360
seminars how to not get in trouble with

602
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,600
your clients return their phone calls

603
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,759
return their emails be

604
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,599
responsive to them some of the some of

605
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,839
the clients that have liked me the best

606
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,359
and sent me the best referrals are not

607
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,399
necessarily the ones that get the best

608
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,038
outcomes

609
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,159
they're the ones that felt like i

610
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,519
cared about them you know that i

611
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,440
actually and i do care about them but

612
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,480
i'm saying you have to

613
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,400
respond to them so plea and even if it's

614
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,000
not just for a business from a business

615
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,038
standpoint your

616
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,279
patients can get in trouble and if they

617
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,038
don't get if somebody who's looking into

618
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,839
their status doesn't get through to the

619
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,000
doctor that can be a problem

620
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,119
do evaluate the patient's needs for

621
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
cannabis this one's a little bit

622
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,558
repetitive when i was putting this

623
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,960
together i was working with my son and

624
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,759
he was teaching me powerpoint and i

625
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,440
i tripped a couple of times but this is

626
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,599
about getting medical records that

627
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,519
should be the first question you ask

628
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,759
when someone calls can you send us

629
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,558
records i have a very good friend who's

630
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,960
a pretty prominent uh cannabis doctor

631
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,480
and the first question that their

632
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,279
uh uh

633
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,120
uh staff asks when somebody calls is

634
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,759
can you when can you send us or to the

635
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,119
effect of can you send us your records

636
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,720
and if they say they don't want to do

637
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,319
that they just say thank you we can't

638
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,919
help you

639
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,639
you get the records you look through

640
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,120
them

641
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,440
then you make the appointment then you

642
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,079
go from there

643
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,000
don't recommend specific amounts unless

644
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,079
it is required in your state which i'm

645
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,400
not aware that any state recommend

646
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,240
requires doctors to describe excuse me

647
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,960
to prescribe specific amounts of

648
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,599
cannabis but otherwise don't because you

649
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,600
can't really prescribe cannabis in the

650
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,439
same way you just can't do it there

651
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,959
isn't the analytical data there are too

652
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,240
many variables

653
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,400
and there are too many other there are

654
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,960
too many variables in the product that

655
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,919
may end up in the hands of your patient

656
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,880
so it's all about go start slow start

657
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,440
low

658
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,440
go slow

659
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,440
don't i'm going to shift gears a little

660
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,599
bit to driving this always comes up when

661
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,798
i give this talk or something similar to

662
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,359
this talk

663
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,359
about driving don't fail to advise your

664
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,439
patients on the effects of cannabis

665
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,798
combined with alcohol or prescription

666
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,038
drugs for driving okay don't do that

667
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,440
cannabis itself excuse me isn't

668
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,960
necessarily all that damaging when it

669
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,200
comes to driving in california excuse me

670
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,759
one has to be considered impaired not

671
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,038
just under the influence but impaired if

672
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,319
they're driving and there is a

673
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,640
difference

674
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,960
under the influence means that the

675
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,559
medication or drug is having its

676
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,000
intended effect

677
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,279
that is not necessarily impairment

678
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
um

679
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,519
the general uh let's see if i got this

680
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,798
in the right order

681
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,240
okay

682
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:10,798
the general the general uh admonition

683
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,120
that doctors and please correct me if

684
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,639
i've got this not quite right but this

685
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,798
has come up in my court cases the

686
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,960
general admonition the doctor is to give

687
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,798
a patient about driving is

688
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,279
with the exception of alcohol which has

689
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,119
a per se limit of blood alcohol

690
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,798
concentration that everyone agrees at

691
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,158
least legally speaking agrees is

692
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:29,519
unlawful to have in your blood when

693
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,799
driving

694
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,798
that's not true for cannabis it's

695
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,038
actually not true for any drug

696
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:38,000
in california for example it is unlawful

697
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,759
to drive under the influence of alcohol

698
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,880
any drug and that includes prescription

699
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,879
medications or the combined effects of

700
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,320
alcohol in any drug

701
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,240
so excuse me but when it comes to a drug

702
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:54,158
if it is having its intended effect you

703
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,720
are not presumed to be impaired okay the

704
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,159
the general way in which uh the courts

705
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,159
have now ruled the way in which to

706
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,000
determine whether someone is genuinely

707
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,760
impaired by a drug

708
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,880
is primarily by the way that they're

709
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,798
driving

710
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,400
and then if it

711
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,200
actually involves a police officer

712
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,919
called a drug recognition expert who has

713
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,840
to do this kind of complicated exam when

714
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,278
it comes to cannabis there are largely

715
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,199
only two

716
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,400
sobriety tests that are supposed to

717
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,558
really matter

718
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,720
one is lack of convergence

719
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,278
so presumably the doctors know what this

720
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,400
is right it's a as an object moves

721
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,319
toward

722
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,080
your eyes they're supposed to converge

723
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,599
and if they don't converge just right

724
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,359
that's evidence that you may have

725
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,959
cannabis on board

726
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,399
but i guess it's also the case that

727
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,319
something like 25 percent of the

728
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,360
population has lack of convergence

729
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,599
anyway

730
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,359
so it's maybe not all that conclusive

731
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:49,359
the other one is called the

732
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,879
slowed internal clock which means

733
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,798
that what they typically do is they have

734
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,960
you close your eyes and estimate when 30

735
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,639
seconds have passed

736
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,000
oh okay

737
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,240
close your eyes and have you estimate

738
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,240
when 30 seconds have passed if it takes

739
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,558
you too long then they can say that

740
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,960
cannabis may have may have caused that

741
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,839
it's consistent with cannabis use

742
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,919
do familiarize yourself with the laws of

743
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,158
your state your their state's many

744
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,559
doctors on the possession and use of

745
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,440
cannabis

746
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,200
don't

747
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,400
think that an hour or two of legal

748
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,798
consultation is too expensive

749
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,640
i'm not saying this for myself i i do

750
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,720
mostly criminal defense

751
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,520
i get i mean i've been around long

752
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,679
enough i get pretty good fees from

753
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,599
people that do really twisted stuff so i

754
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,600
don't need to worry about consulting

755
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,439
with doctors all that much

756
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,439
so this isn't some sort of advertisement

757
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,519
for me this is

758
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,679
for your own good just you know find a

759
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,798
good lawyer and wherever you practice

760
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,480
medicine

761
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,000
uh and just you know pay for a couple

762
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,599
hours of their time an hour to their

763
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,400
time to make sure that you're not you

764
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,918
know

765
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,038
bumping up against the law because the

766
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,080
law is an unfriendly cat

767
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:02,879
don't give legal advice to your patients

768
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,119
boy oh boy people i the doctors i know

769
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,720
that do this that i do consult with

770
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,959
they're constantly saying well what can

771
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,278
i tell my patient about the laws and

772
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,919
what what's legal for them to do

773
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,119
and the answer to that is

774
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,038
nothing

775
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,479
you have to refer them to a lawyer you

776
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,240
really can't give legal advice that's

777
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,440
excuse me that's a very dangerous game

778
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,599
to play

779
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,278
refer them to a lawyer you can if

780
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,278
there's published materials in your

781
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,278
state which there probably is certainly

782
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,119
refer them to that but do not give them

783
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,640
legal advice even if you think you know

784
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,000
you're right even if you think you know

785
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,080
you're right

786
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,079
do tell your patients what you have

787
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,240
found to be effective in your practice

788
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,199
for your patients

789
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,038
that's the best way to prescribe it or

790
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,278
to recommend it

791
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,119
is don't say this is what you should do

792
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,278
there's in california for example it's

793
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,798
extremely tricky because doctors are not

794
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,558
allowed to have any financial

795
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,798
relationship with any producer or

796
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,119
provider of cannabis

797
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,798
so you can certainly run into trouble if

798
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,399
you start going down that road so just

799
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,119
say this is what i have found my

800
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,440
patients have found to be effective

801
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,918
don't recommend specific amounts this is

802
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,840
one of those somewhat redundant ones

803
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,400
oops did i miss one

804
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:19,519
do understand the the difference between

805
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,120
hemp and marijuana the long explanation

806
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:26,000
is that the fda has not yet approved

807
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:29,038
or given its signature to hemp

808
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,960
for medicinal use and if you that's why

809
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,640
when you hear those ads on the radio for

810
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,120
it's legal in every state and it's the

811
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,080
greatest minimum what's that last

812
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:41,359
tagline this is not in this uh product

813
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,158
is not intended to diagnose treat or

814
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,398
cure

815
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,960
any medical condition okay

816
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,879
if you're if it is being advertised as a

817
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,640
medical product as a health related

818
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,880
medical product

819
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,080
then there's a word for that

820
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,399
illegal and the fda has not approved

821
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,720
this yet

822
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,879
they're not policing it because like

823
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,839
when i'm driving 85 they just don't feel

824
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,440
like it's something they're going to

825
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,119
expend that much and they feel that

826
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,480
eventually they will

827
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,759
and they're changing their rules but

828
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,159
right now they they haven't and

829
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,519
everybody knows that marijuana

830
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,840
is the plant with three percent of thc

831
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,798
uh delta nine et cetera et cetera and

832
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,319
there is a difference but that that farm

833
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,558
bill that everybody thought you know

834
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:28,158
just turned the world around in it

835
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,158
not yet and we're not there yet

836
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,960
do excuse me don't think that hemp is

837
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,199
legal to buy and sell as medicine i

838
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,440
think i've already covered that

839
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,080
do understand the difference between

840
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,320
clinical data and trial data clinical

841
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,398
data and i'll let a doctor correct me if

842
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,720
i'm wrong clinical data is your

843
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,119
experience with your patients

844
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,880
trial data is what pharmaceutical

845
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,879
companies produce through

846
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,399
double-blind studies which really

847
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,399
haven't been done with the exception of

848
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:59,359
a couple of medications that are

849
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:02,319
currently approved do realize that with

850
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,839
medical cannabis what you do is more art

851
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,240
than science i remember when i was a

852
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,480
little kid my pediatrician i remember

853
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,480
seeing this sign that said medical arts

854
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,759
building and when i got older i used to

855
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,000
take the bus by the building they

856
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,759
thought medical arts isn't medicine

857
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,640
science all right

858
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,158
well there's a lot of art to this

859
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,679
practice of medicine and if it's

860
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,080
particularly when it comes to cannabis

861
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,000
because the science is limited uh but

862
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,000
that doesn't mean that a good doctor

863
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,519
can't practice in this regard

864
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,880
uh but you have to

865
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,038
you know kind of get a feel for what

866
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,960
you're doing and have a feel for your

867
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,879
patients

868
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,440
do finally ultimately make what the the

869
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,919
ultimate standard the thing you'll have

870
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,840
to answer to for the medical board in

871
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,840
court whenever you have to ultimately

872
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,359
answer to it is what is

873
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,439
the standard of care

874
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,278
and the standard of care is nothing a

875
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,600
hundred percent set in stone it's what

876
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,000
an expert in your field would say it is

877
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,519
and what would be this uh agreed upon

878
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,359
standard of care

879
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,960
excuse me i think probably most people

880
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,119
know it most doctors know what it is

881
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,640
it's some intuitive level you get

882
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,759
records for people that you're going to

883
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,919
look into

884
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,640
you stay in contact with them you follow

885
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,880
up

886
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,559
you make sure that you don't over

887
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,159
recommend or over prescribe you don't

888
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,158
ignore your patients

889
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,000
i feel like i'm my grandmother telling

890
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,000
me what to do but that's what that's

891
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,679
what it is you know sometimes for myself

892
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,519
my standard is what would my grandmother

893
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,120
have said i should do and that's a

894
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,720
pretty good standard and it probably

895
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,278
works most of the time

896
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,360
you know it's common sense but it's it

897
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,880
it doesn't always you know in any

898
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,719
particular situation you just have to

899
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,320
take a step back what is the standard

900
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,839
what kind of what do i feel comfortable

901
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,678
with what would i want

902
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,519
someone to do for me what would i expect

903
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,798
others to do for me

904
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,798
so i made it 30 minutes

905
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:53,740
[Applause]

906
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,798
hi michael thank you sure um i'm uh i'm

907
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,240
not a doctor but i play one on tv

908
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,158
i'm also the host of a co-host of a

909
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,759
podcast with chella cannabis helps

910
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,480
dementia i think she spoke to you last

911
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,119
night about uh ryan's law brian's law

912
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,679
and rcfes and could you uh speak to

913
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,719
ryan's law in california and is it going

914
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,600
to help us get cannabis into rcfes or is

915
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,440
it specifically six months to live

916
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,319
hospice well there's six months to live

917
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,720
part i'm not it is hospice this is

918
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,158
i think it's one year actually is the uh

919
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,839
okay so

920
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,480
ryan's law is a law that says

921
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,678
essentially that the state passed a law

922
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,599
that says

923
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,080
that

924
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:40,719
hospice care hospice providers are now

925
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:43,439
required to allow the use of cannabis by

926
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,440
patients who are in hospice

927
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,798
i didn't look up the the time factor but

928
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,640
i believe it is

929
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,519
if they are terminal which means one

930
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,960
year uh predicted life

931
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:57,919
uh based on the current dog prognosis

932
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,720
the the provider is required to allow

933
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,960
the use of it and to create a protocol

934
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,480
for how it's to be used and distributed

935
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,880
the other big uh requirement is no no

936
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,038
inhalation of cannabis is allowed so no

937
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,120
smoking and no vaping interesting so it

938
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,000
has to be either be philosophy orally

939
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:19,678
consumed which means either an edible or

940
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,278
an oil right and and that that's it now

941
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,200
if someone's sick and in hospital

942
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,200
hospice care in california they almost

943
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,360
certainly have a primary caregiver which

944
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,360
is someone who cares for them that's the

945
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,359
person who's going to be buying it and

946
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,558
bringing it to them or finding it or

947
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:36,000
growing it and bringing it to them

948
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,678
that would have to be allowed they'd

949
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,278
have to have they'd have to allow a

950
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,480
primary caregiver to bring it out of the

951
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,480
premises

952
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,960
a primary caregiver is also someone who

953
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,599
administers it which is there's a whole

954
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,519
legal uh definition of administering it

955
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,199
but more than likely in this scenario

956
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,839
somebody's pretty sick it means putting

957
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,880
it on the spoon or and giving it to him

958
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,918
you know

959
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,399
uh the hospice personnel are are not

960
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,038
required to store it or administer it

961
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,798
but there are required to allow it

962
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:09,079
got it so i hope that's a pretty good

963
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,079
explanation yeah thank you sure

964
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,960
okay

965
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:16,960
[Applause]
