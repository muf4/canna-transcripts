1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:11,199
so I'm gonna start off with just some

2
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:15,579
mention and thanks to collaborators on

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:18,070
this project people at cordage and nets

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,469
Christine who runs our clinical group

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,079
and some of our bioinformatics folks who

6
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:24,939
help analyze the data as well as our

7
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,739
collaborators on the data I'm going to

8
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:30,248
talk about today Eric marsh and Oren

9
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:32,589
divinsky yours ADA plea is a statistical

10
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:34,479
geneticist at Boston University and she

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,199
helped on some of the analysis as well

12
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,569
and Kevin who initiated the project so

13
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:43,659
I'm gonna have two parts to this talk

14
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:46,109
one investigation of genetic factors

15
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:48,698
that influence response to cannabidiol

16
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,948
for treatment of epilepsy and this is

17
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:52,599
actually looking at the same group of

18
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:55,089
patients that you just heard about from

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,039
Elizabeth and Orion in this open label

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:02,140
trial and so some of the things that we

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,920
may have found there are some response

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:08,170
differences in CD kl5 patients patients

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,840
with mutations in that gene and then

24
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,340
some regulatory snips in another gene

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,640
that may be associated with better

26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,900
response but it's still early days so

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,060
and then the second part i'm going to

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,380
talk about rare variation and and

29
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:26,230
cannabinoid system genes and here we we

30
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:29,289
found rare variants and the cannabinoid

31
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:31,240
receptor type one and diacylglycerol

32
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:36,969
lipase which are associated with

33
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:40,060
neurological phenotypes so early on we

34
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:44,890
got involved with folks running this

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,150
trial Oran and Eric Marsh and more

36
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,409
recently we brought on other

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,810
collaborators who are also participating

38
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,909
in this trial the open label trial and

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,670
so what we've been doing is essentially

40
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:57,519
analyzing the DNA of the patients who

41
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,409
are in the trial and looking for factors

42
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,640
that are involved with response and what

43
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,890
I'll tell you about today are the

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,689
results from the first 75 patients that

45
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:11,409
we've analyzed so courtesan our main

46
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:13,620
sort of thing is neurological testing

47
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:16,210
testing for neurological disorders

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,219
epilepsy and seizure disorders

49
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,780
developmental disorders autism

50
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,979
mitochondrial and functional disorders a

51
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,210
whole series of different gene panels

52
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,519
comprehensive panels with large numbers

53
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:35,409
of genes and actually whole exome

54
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,650
sequencing as well so the panel we used

55
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:42,549
for this study is called epi seek

56
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:46,450
comprehensive it has 471 genes it covers

57
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:50,890
the major epilepsy associated genes GABA

58
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:53,979
pathway genes we included in the panel

59
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:56,859
from very early on the major into

60
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:57,719
cannabinoid system genes so the cb1 cb2

61
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,670
receptor

62
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:05,349
daegil and and mag lipase and then it

63
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:08,049
also contains a number of genes that are

64
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,689
actually associated with endocannabinoid

65
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,250
system response so this was more or less

66
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:15,159
by accident but when we actually went

67
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,830
through and analyzed a lot of data from

68
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:21,490
a large number of genes we found a list

69
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:25,600
of genes there that when patients are

70
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:29,439
either given cb1 agonists or various

71
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:32,939
other compounds that the activity of

72
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:36,219
these genes or their expression changes

73
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:42,129
and it also includes genes involved in

74
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:43,449
drug metabolism so basically we're

75
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:47,409
looking for a genotype-phenotype

76
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:51,399
correlation so significant variants are

77
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:52,960
identified reviewed and verified the

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,099
clinical data is considered in relation

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,290
to the patient's disease and the known

80
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:04,439
effects of mutations in various genes

81
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:08,379
and then we basically score the variants

82
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:13,240
on a five-point scale so they're from

83
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:15,669
benign to pathogenic and and in many

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,560
cases were able to identify what we call

85
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,479
a driver variant which is simply a rare

86
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,608
variant in a particular gene that

87
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,660
explains the patient's disease and

88
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:30,008
phenotype and so from this study the 75

89
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:32,829
patients we identified those

90
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:35,619
types of driver variants in about 40

91
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:40,629
little over 40% of the patients 32

92
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:43,149
patients okay and this actually shows

93
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:46,838
kind of a distribution of of those

94
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:50,889
driver variants from that we identified

95
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:53,319
in these patients with the response

96
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:55,418
curve so each one each bar there is a

97
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,098
patient and it's the same kind of

98
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:59,348
response diagram that Elizabeth showed

99
00:04:57,098 --> 00:05:01,959
you so we've got you know the good

100
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:03,788
responders are down here and the poor

101
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,999
responders are up here and when we

102
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:10,048
actually look at the genes across that

103
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:13,119
spectrum of response we see Sen one a

104
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:16,028
this pretty much covers the whole range

105
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:17,499
of responders even though we know

106
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:19,598
there's a good response and travail

107
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:22,809
patients which have these STM 1a

108
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:24,808
mutations there's no actual statistical

109
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:28,509
correlation with the presence of an SCO

110
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:32,409
what a mutation and response on the

111
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:35,259
other hand we'll see kl5 they kind of

112
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:37,478
stack up towards the poor responding end

113
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:39,249
of the spectrum and there there are no

114
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:41,618
really great responders that that have

115
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:44,499
CD ko5 mutations it's not reaching

116
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:47,949
significance here it's you know still

117
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:50,979
above point O five so it's a it's a

118
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:52,718
possible indication but and we need more

119
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:56,908
data to really investigate this further

120
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:56,908
but that's that's where we are right now

121
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:03,329
KL 5 was interesting it's a protein

122
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:07,439
kinase involved in transcriptional

123
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:13,028
modulation of synaptic plasticity the

124
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:16,049
process is dependent on NMDA r of the

125
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:19,298
NMDA our system and there are other

126
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:21,688
genes in that pathway that we know also

127
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:27,068
are associated with refract I'll

128
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:28,718
seizures so I'm not sure she be a just

129
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:31,179
may not influence this pathway as

130
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:35,588
strongly as other pathways but obviously

131
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:38,318
need more data to look into that so the

132
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:41,618
next thing out move to is drug drug

133
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,330
interactions you heard already that

134
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:45,069
Colaba Sam

135
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:50,050
his paper actually by Elizabeth feels

136
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:51,340
group is is has an influence and that

137
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,158
there's an interaction between club

138
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:56,709
clubs and can have a dial which leads to

139
00:06:54,158 --> 00:07:00,908
increase of this metabolite and does

140
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:04,089
methyl clubs and we looked across these

141
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:06,370
patients all 75 patients and here you

142
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:08,378
can see them sort of sorted by response

143
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,269
again so the good responders are down

144
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,879
here and where we smaller stir up there

145
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:17,288
and we actually looked at the data that

146
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:19,870
was available for club as M levels which

147
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:22,360
are the green dots across the middle and

148
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:26,500
and this methyl Club of Sam which is the

149
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,180
blue dots here there is limited data so

150
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:33,218
not all the data is complete for this

151
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:35,728
for these patients so well we do see and

152
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:38,168
this is reported in the paper there's

153
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:40,568
most of the patients down with the good

154
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:42,818
responding and happen to also be taking

155
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:46,870
clubs am so there is clearly an

156
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:48,158
interaction there that's significant on

157
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,750
the other hand if you actually look at

158
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,439
the investment for clubs M levels

159
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,120
there's no correlation with the response

160
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,930
relative to the level so it's not just

161
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:03,189
simply a level of investment clubs or

162
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:07,150
clubs in itself we also looked at the

163
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:09,490
drug metabolism variance from this data

164
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:14,709
set we don't see anything popping out in

165
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:18,009
terms of that any one of these enzymes

166
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:20,168
which influence the metabolism of CBD is

167
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,569
associated with a good response or a

168
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:25,000
poor response but again we have limited

169
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:29,528
data here so this is early days from

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,059
that so this may be think

171
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:38,610
I mean clubs am and CBD perhaps they

172
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:41,259
acting on the same pathway Klopas m15

173
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:44,110
benzodiazepine it targets the GABA

174
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:47,740
receptor particularly the alpha tubes

175
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:51,940
ones with alpha two subunits there are a

176
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:56,080
number of GABA signaling genes involved

177
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:58,840
in various epilepsy syndromes and so

178
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,110
you know this is interesting perhaps CBD

179
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,850
acts on this pathway and in fact there's

180
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,159
a regional publication that just came

181
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,870
out in journal of pharmacological

182
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,939
research by Bacchus at all

183
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,720
let's show us that CBD is actually an

184
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,450
allosteric agonist of the gaba receptor

185
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:20,259
and also prefers these subtypes that

186
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:22,420
have the alpha 2 subunits so this is an

187
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:25,029
interesting finding and perhaps these

188
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:28,389
things are both kind of working in an

189
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:34,329
additive way in patients that are

190
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:36,429
receiving both so I'm going to shift and

191
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,470
talk about common genetic variants now

192
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:43,899
so so far these have all been about rare

193
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:45,129
variants that we've been seeing so you

194
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,199
can take an approach of genome-wide

195
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:48,639
Association studies to study common

196
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,090
variation and its association with

197
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:55,240
disease the CBD studies sample size is

198
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:58,360
too small for this so what we are doing

199
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:12,940
is using the data at whoops sorry back

200
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:15,879
using the data from the using the data

201
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,680
from our gene panel and essentially

202
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:21,939
taking the common variants which are

203
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:24,159
nearby the exons of known genes and and

204
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,150
looking there for a signal that might be

205
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,620
associated with response and so we took

206
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,179
we recalled all the data so we had

207
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,629
consistent variant calls on the whole

208
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:37,409
data set filtered the variants for minor

209
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:40,679
allele count and hardy-weinberg

210
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:43,240
compliance and then basically look for

211
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,219
the allelic distribution of individual

212
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,370
variants and essentially testing for

213
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:52,540
correlation with response in that

214
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:57,450
distribution of variants so an initial

215
00:10:52,539 --> 00:11:00,759
pass at this back in 2015

216
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:03,940
looking at the entire panel it was about

217
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:07,210
6,000 variants we immediately realized

218
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,110
that we had too many variants to reach

219
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:12,100
us at these

220
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,950
significance level for this data set but

221
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,320
just looking at a very small fraction of

222
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:21,160
the data we noticed that some of these

223
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,839
genes that we're seeing there are

224
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,269
actually genes that have some

225
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,240
association within the cannabinoid

226
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:31,000
system and the response of the end of

227
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,950
cannabinoid system so what we decided to

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,958
do was focus in on just the genes there

229
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,660
are 39 genes in the panel that are

230
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:44,559
associated with the endocannabinoid

231
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:49,528
system as I described earlier either

232
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:52,268
oops that either bind cannabinoids or

233
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:55,299
have activity it changes associated with

234
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:57,159
them those genes are only about 8% of

235
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,019
the panel but three out of four of the

236
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,778
top genes that we saw in this initial

237
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:03,639
past were in that category so we thought

238
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:07,028
that was significant and we should just

239
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:10,269
focus in on those and so we repeated

240
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:15,278
that analysis on the 75 patients here

241
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:17,259
we're seeing one particular gene is is

242
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,409
approaching the significance level that

243
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:25,360
we would like to see still not enough

244
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:27,519
data or enough patient samples to give

245
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,949
us a significance level but it is

246
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,610
approaching it this gene is interesting

247
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:36,490
it's Leo fibrillar e acidic protein

248
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:43,509
which is involved in differentiation of

249
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:45,879
astrocytes and essentially the cb1 and

250
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:48,698
cb2 blockade results in persistent over

251
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,889
expression of this gene and anandamayi

252
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:52,990
promotes neural precursor cell

253
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:55,480
differentiation into gf a positive

254
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,930
astral glial cells these variants that

255
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,209
we're seeing there is 11% minor allele

256
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:03,219
frequency they're in a regulatory region

257
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:06,669
that has promoter elements enhancer

258
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:09,550
elements and actually changes messenger

259
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:11,379
RNA levels for a few different genes so

260
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:13,719
so there's something going on there that

261
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:15,519
looks interesting but but again we

262
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,009
haven't really reached the significance

263
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,259
level to say that that this is

264
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:24,939
actually a response elements at this

265
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:28,360
point so I'm gonna switch and talk about

266
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:31,510
the second part of the talk this is

267
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:35,110
really a separate study looking at the

268
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:39,220
core ECS genes in our panel and it's not

269
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,659
just the epic battle but also our so

270
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,860
called nuke seek panel that looks at

271
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:46,569
mitochondrial disease has these genes

272
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:50,590
include a number of these genes included

273
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:53,100
in it so we have the C n R 1 C n R 2

274
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:58,230
those are the the two major receptors

275
00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:03,009
which is breaks down an and amide

276
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:05,830
Maglite place and diacylglycerol light

277
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,450
base alpha which produces 2 AG so

278
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,300
basically what we're doing is looking

279
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,420
for rare variants in these genes in a

280
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:15,009
large data set so since these genes were

281
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,409
included in these panels and we've been

282
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:20,110
basically sequencing patients and

283
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:22,299
delivering tests for several years now

284
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:29,159
on these same panels we have large

285
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:35,769
numbers of samples so over 3800 epi C

286
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:37,480
tests and 2100 nuke C tests that we're

287
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,220
looking at and so basically what we did

288
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,170
is just parse out all the phenotypic

289
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,259
terms for all the cases where these

290
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:46,269
variants were observed select terms that

291
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:50,289
were present in at least 20% of those

292
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,879
cases and then if there were some rare

293
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,309
variants shared amongst those we

294
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,809
included those select a bunch of random

295
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:58,149
controls that do not contain those

296
00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:00,759
variants and just perform a fisher exact

297
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:04,480
test to test for the phenotypes present

298
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,009
or absent in cases versus controls when

299
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
we did this we did not see anything

300
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:13,080
significant for CNR too far or mac

301
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:15,459
maggle but we did first C n R 1 and

302
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:20,259
Aguila and that's what I'm going to tell

303
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:25,930
you about so here for instance in C n R

304
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:28,480
1 we found 24 cases that had rare

305
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:30,819
variants rare potentially deleterious

306
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,019
variants in this gene

307
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:39,290
and looking at cases versus controls for

308
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:41,840
migraine and headache we see significant

309
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:44,480
association of the four fold four and a

310
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,820
half fold increase of migraine headaches

311
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,129
same for sleep disorder a larger

312
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,260
increase associated with those rare

313
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:52,970
variants anxiety did not reach

314
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:56,240
significance by itself but in

315
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,879
combination with migraine or headache or

316
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,320
sleep disorders was very significant and

317
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:06,139
a significant increase in risk so so we

318
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,450
think you know there are people walking

319
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,879
around out there who have these kind of

320
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:14,360
rare variants in their scene or one gene

321
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:19,399
and this could be an explanation for for

322
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:22,039
part of this disorder and in actually so

323
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,350
interestingly there are two out of six

324
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:27,799
cases that had one particular variant

325
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:30,529
that shared the same variant and they

326
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,449
have combined sleep disturbance anxiety

327
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:33,980
and abnormality of the autonomous

328
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:41,509
nervous system completely unrelated

329
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:45,470
patients with similar phenotypes so when

330
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:49,549
you knock out the cb1 gene in mice they

331
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:52,810
display behaviors of elevated avoidance

332
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:56,389
freezing risk assessment type behaviors

333
00:16:52,809 --> 00:17:00,699
they have an early accelerated early

334
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:00,699
learning as well as early memory decline

335
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:06,680
actually see when you knock out the gene

336
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,199
oops sorry

337
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,060
[Music]

338
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,550
and there's also this thing called

339
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:16,639
clinical and a canary deficiency which

340
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:19,490
many of you have heard about theory

341
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,079
promoted by Ethan Rousseau for many

342
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,750
years

343
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:26,240
it posits that disorders like migraine

344
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,549
fibromyalgia and irritable bowel

345
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,329
syndrome are related manifestations of

346
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:34,879
low in to cannabinoid tone and these

347
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:38,750
things these frequently occur together

348
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,060
and they're they respond well to THC so

349
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:45,569
what we're seeing in these rare

350
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,190
cases seems to parallel that and so it

351
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:50,730
kind of suggests that these patients

352
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:56,519
would be good candidates for cb1 agonist

353
00:17:50,730 --> 00:18:01,769
therapy so given that there is a crystal

354
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:03,900
structure of cannabinoid receptor we

355
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:06,660
decided to just take a look and see

356
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,570
where the variants map on that structure

357
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:13,710
so it turns out they actually map to the

358
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:17,339
to the what the injury that seven

359
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,440
transmembrane domain near someone near

360
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:21,599
the binding pocket or around that domain

361
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,539
relatively few in the cytoplasmic

362
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:28,349
signaling domain so we think that's

363
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:33,769
interesting perhaps that this domain is

364
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:40,799
more tolerant to variation in in humans

365
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:44,970
so in for diacylglycerol lipase we see a

366
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:47,190
similar thing different phenotypes so

367
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,850
here we're seeing an excess of seizures

368
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:55,740
in these 36 cases that had rare variants

369
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:58,649
excess of developmental disorders one

370
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,650
particular rare phenotype simply label

371
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,410
as abnormality or brain morphology we

372
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:07,340
see that it increased at significant

373
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:09,420
levels and then combinations of these

374
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:14,069
and these these are all quite

375
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,269
significant so it looks like we have an

376
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:18,599
associated with increased susceptibility

377
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:23,940
to seizures and developmental disorders

378
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:29,099
these are enriched in our database by

379
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:31,080
about seven times compared to nomads

380
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:34,049
which is actually a database of

381
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:37,379
ostensibly normal people about 130,000

382
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:41,519
individuals so so significant enrichment

383
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:48,030
in a disease population and a number

384
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:50,549
with zero frequency and again we see

385
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:54,389
some shared phenotypes so this this

386
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:55,109
particular rare abnormality of brain

387
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,610
morphology

388
00:19:55,109 --> 00:20:01,949
I was highly rich in Taglit variants

389
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:08,808
including two of five patients with one

390
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:11,250
particular variant that they share so

391
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:14,279
there's no crystal structure for Degla

392
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:16,410
but you can see that these variants kind

393
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:19,470
of cluster in the three prime end of the

394
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:22,440
protein or at least of the secondary

395
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,569
structure this particular domain has a

396
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:31,650
lot of phosphorylation sites and was

397
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:35,909
probably more tolerant of variation so I

398
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:41,450
won't go into this but essentially Degla

399
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:43,519
is involved in neuronal developments

400
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:47,250
there are a number of studies and

401
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,869
knockout mice that show it alters nerve

402
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:54,720
development in different parts of the

403
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:56,579
brain when it's knocked out and so so we

404
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,519
think this is is interesting and

405
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:01,548
significant and it just definitely

406
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,519
warrants a digital study on other

407
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:07,679
endocannabinoid system genes so

408
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,839
basically we've found these rare

409
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,890
variants we have some punitive

410
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,109
associations from the CBD response study

411
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,520
and we're basically working now on

412
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,139
following up with some additional

413
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:23,369
patients from Elizabeth Steele's group

414
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:26,040
and Jersey so far skiis group about 144

415
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:29,298
additional patients plus Eric Marsh that

416
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:32,399
we should be able to push push these

417
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:35,700
associations over the top hopefully and

418
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,440
I'm just gonna end on a quick note we're

419
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,210
always seeking new collaborations for

420
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,490
these kind of genetic studies try to

421
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,410
understand from the genetic side what's

422
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,990
going on when we treat patients with

423
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:49,490
cannabinoids we've been developing some

424
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:51,470
new resources panels to look at pain

425
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,519
syndromes migraines abdominal

426
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,058
fibromyalgia a whole bunch of genes that

427
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:59,359
we basically pulled in so that we can

428
00:21:56,058 --> 00:22:01,379
use this in in a study to identify

429
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:04,619
additional factors that might be

430
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,320
involved in response and courtesan has a

431
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,879
new subsidiary called Avant rajan Eric's

432
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,189
which you may be

433
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,890
arrested in we have panels from migraine

434
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:18,150
abdominal pain autoinflammatory disease

435
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:19,410
and other conditions and so you can

436
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:24,410
actually talk to the folks out at the

437
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:24,410
booth and give you some helpful advice

438
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,369
you
