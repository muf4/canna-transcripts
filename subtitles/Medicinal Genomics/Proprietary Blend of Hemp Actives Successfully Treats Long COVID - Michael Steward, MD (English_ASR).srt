1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:09,900
thank you I'm Dr Michael Stewart uh Mike

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:12,058
or Dr Mike if you want to be formal

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,699
um and before I start today I need to

4
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:17,640
share some breaking news that was

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,100
published yesterday from the AMA

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,439
they have actually found that in several

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,380
different chronic disease States medical

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,740
marijuana patients have a higher quality

9
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,739
of life

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,660
um just some of the western backs maybe

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,020
a little bit behind us here and that is

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,839
my training as well but um anyway I was

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,239
board certified in Family Practice in

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,040
the 1990s that's a little bit after the

15
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,578
Jurassic period for some folks in the

16
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:50,759
room here I did mostly HIV care I

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,920
started doing that in residency and then

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,280
that wound up being the focus of my

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,679
office and uh so I became experienced in

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,640
bringing novel therapies into clinical

21
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,680
practice and although cannabis is not a

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,739
novel therapy our use of it kind of is

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,740
so I'm applying that

24
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:12,899
that experience that I have here into

25
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:15,179
cannabis my history as I ran with fire

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,540
rescue for seven years and that's how I

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,820
entered uh into the field of medicine I

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,340
taught paramedicine and fire science for

29
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,559
a while and I learned a lot of very

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,340
valuable information about medicine even

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,719
before I went to medical school and uh I

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,939
can remember while I was in medical

33
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,340
school and I had Advanced cardiac life

34
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,379
support certification that had lapsed

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,560
and I was still running in the field on

36
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:42,179
weekends and my physician advisor gave

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,400
me some very good advice when I said

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,280
what do I do if I come across somebody

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,740
my certification is lapsed and he looked

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,439
at me and he said you know what if you

41
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:55,618
keep your patients best interest in your

42
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:58,919
heart I will always back you up

43
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,019
and if I ever find out that you didn't

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,780
do something you knew how to do because

45
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:08,639
of a bureaucratic issue you're in a lot

46
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,259
of trouble and so that stayed with me

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,259
um anyway so I have a little bit

48
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:16,199
different entry into medicine if we

49
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,000
arrive with fire rescue a car is down an

50
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,799
embankment in a creek

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,120
you know and it's four o'clock in the

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,520
morning you don't say this is

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,319
inconvenient we'll come back later these

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,239
people are suffering and we need to do

55
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,759
something now

56
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,599
um so I was involved in some repurposing

57
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,039
of medications when it came to HIV a lot

58
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,899
of resistance to that that I'm

59
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,759
understanding much better now than I did

60
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,860
back then

61
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,939
um but people were dying we needed to be

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,220
bold

63
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,739
and I did a lot of uh

64
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,659
um interesting care

65
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,759
um the Ivory Tower delay kind of

66
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,098
confused me because that wasn't a part

67
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,399
of my training

68
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:58,979
um and uh I had a lot of HIV patients in

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,219
fact I was the largest Family Practice

70
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:05,039
provider of HIV care in a five-state

71
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,139
region I noticed that my clients who

72
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,598
were using medicinal marijuana were

73
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,598
doing even better than my clients that

74
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,299
we're not and you would think as an

75
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,039
early adopter and a bold person who has

76
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
a little bit of a renegade too that I

77
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,759
would have been using medicinal

78
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,760
marijuana back then

79
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,378
um regretfully it was a time when

80
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,199
Amendment two had passed in Colorado

81
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:30,479
where my office was we were the only

82
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,579
office advertising as gay and lesbian

83
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,500
friendly in the state of Colorado at the

84
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,300
time an amendment to allow

85
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,539
discrimination based on sexual

86
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,060
orientation my attorney told me not to

87
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,798
do medical marijuana and I listened I

88
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,459
was afraid

89
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,879
um

90
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,060
so at any rate ultimately

91
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:53,479
the office that uh I called my Adult Day

92
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,000
Care Center for my staff

93
00:03:53,479 --> 00:04:00,598
really did become a great Institution

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,818
for folks who had HIV and I wound up

95
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,878
sitting in multiple pharmaceutical

96
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:08,098
advisory boards I was involved in some

97
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,899
clinical studies although I can

98
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:12,359
understand the frustration of most

99
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,459
investigators when I said no to their

100
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,840
studies because we're using very toxic

101
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,939
medications and Do no harm was important

102
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,799
um I've been the medical director for

103
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:25,620
one of the largest hospices in the world

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,540
one of their divisions anyway a home

105
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,639
health care agency I was the medical

106
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,740
director for a medicinal marijuana

107
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,199
company in California before they went

108
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,418
recreational I'm a member of the

109
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,340
American Academy of Family Practice the

110
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:40,439
American Society of addiction medicine

111
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,339
and more importantly the Society of

112
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,779
cannabis clinicians I think if I could

113
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:46,619
physically I'd go back to fire rescue

114
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,918
though

115
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,620
let's see today we're here to talk about

116
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,839
long covid so

117
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,819
um this is a chronic disease and as we

118
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,859
all know that allopathic medicine

119
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,659
sometimes doesn't treat these chronic

120
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,000
diseases quite as well as other

121
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,740
practitioners do

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,300
um but what are we talking about here

123
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,240
it's just the lingering symptoms from

124
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,000
the covet infection typically fatigue

125
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,918
brain fog shortness of breath anxiety

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,899
depression and sleep disturbance

127
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,839
although more than 200 symptoms have

128
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,459
been associated with long covet now guys

129
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,918
start to think about something else

130
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,019
myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic

131
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,939
fatigue syndrome

132
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:30,060
um anyway the first patients came out

133
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:33,600
around 2020 I came in contact with them

134
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,699
we put on a 10-week podcast for these

135
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,620
long haulers where I talked for about 10

136
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,780
or 15 minutes and then we did questions

137
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,879
and answers

138
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,739
um 28 percent of coveted patients are

139
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,259
expected to experience long covet

140
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,538
according to the CDC there are four

141
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,000
million Americans unable to work that's

142
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,819
according to the Brookings Institute but

143
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,439
I just invite you guys to go out into

144
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,659
the service industry and look around

145
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,639
it's a little harder to get work done

146
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,300
these days and I think part of this is

147
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,460
people are are feeling poorly it's a 3.7

148
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,259
trillion dollar cost according to

149
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,159
Harvard

150
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,479
um

151
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,699
anyway let's go on to the next one here

152
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,219
um when covet began I was in the process

153
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,478
of actually moving to Denver for my

154
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,400
company

155
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,800
um but I used to live in Palm Springs

156
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,959
and their HIV Center was becoming a

157
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,360
covid center they asked if I would give

158
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,399
them a hand and so I returned to Palm

159
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,160
Springs I still had a place there at the

160
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:34,739
time and I noticed all the continuing

161
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,620
medical education that I was doing with

162
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,019
covid the inflammatory markers were all

163
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,259
attenuated by cannabis and or its

164
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:45,359
constituents and uh you know we're

165
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,520
talking about cannabis stocks having new

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,139
and diverse ideas well I don't know if

167
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,538
it was really new or diverse but it was

168
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,000
like guys what about the endocannabinoid

169
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,699
system I've been studying that for about

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,918
10 years now and it sure seemed to me

171
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,780
like the endocannabinoid system was at

172
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,758
least involved here and if it was

173
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:05,579
damaged in the acute covet infection

174
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,740
could restoring that or supporting that

175
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,839
help with the symptoms you know could we

176
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,460
get them to disappear

177
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,978
um or at least attenuate those symptoms

178
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,599
illness you know I'm a hammer and

179
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,699
everything looks like a nail when it

180
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,080
comes to cannabis don't ask me if you

181
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,079
should use it just ask me how

182
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,819
um so the human endocannabinoid system

183
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,739
uh this is review for most people here

184
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,259
um I'm still a little gun shy because

185
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,240
during the covet Arena if I talked about

186
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,919
anything like the endocannabinoid system

187
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,439
or if I came out with something that

188
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:41,879
might help with covid

189
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:44,219
um boy it was censored I remember that

190
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,259
with a conference with Dustin sulak him

191
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,180
being censored once so I felt like I was

192
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,639
in good company anyway

193
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,280
um the endocannabinoid system

194
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,680
um it's definitely involved we've got a

195
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,719
lot more receptors than the CB1 and CB2

196
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,639
involved here but what I really want to

197
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,680
point out here is take a look at the CB1

198
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,098
and the CB2 receptors and they have

199
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,019
different actions and we know that THC

200
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:10,139
is going to interact with that CB1

201
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:12,180
receptor we know that CBD also does as a

202
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,000
negative allosteric modulator but we

203
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,740
want a little activity in that CB1 and

204
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,959
so this is why we're going to look for

205
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,660
the full complement of cannabis we're

206
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,638
not looking for

207
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,379
isolates of it here

208
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,300
um anyway we'll go into a little more of

209
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,720
the endocannabinoid system on the next

210
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,720
slide

211
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,599
um so how are we going to balance the

212
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,240
endocannabinoid system remember this is

213
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,640
a three-part system and fortunately

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,860
Dustin sulak's lecture talked a lot here

215
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,080
about these receptors which get up

216
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,720
regulated when we are cannabis naive and

217
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,420
come and contact uh with cannabis so

218
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,639
we've got the The receptors that we know

219
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:53,519
can be involved we know we've got the

220
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,199
ligands those are the endocannabinoids

221
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,240
or naturally occurring cannabinoids or

222
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
the phytocannabinoids

223
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,039
um and then we have the enzymes that

224
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,319
break them down so specifically for long

225
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:07,139
covid we looked at the nine most common

226
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,300
long coveted symptoms

227
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:13,379
um and we chose a

228
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:15,419
phytocannabinoids that we knew would be

229
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:18,919
balancing to the endocannabinoid system

230
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:21,000
and then I selected medicinal terpenes

231
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:22,979
that I knew had some additional

232
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,360
qualities and assumed the flavonoids

233
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,420
that went along with them were

234
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,159
consistent with what was going on there

235
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:33,719
um so this is a full blend of

236
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:37,699
cannabinoids and terpenes and let me

237
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:41,339
just see the CBD to THC ratio here is

238
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,560
non-euporic or intoxicating and when I

239
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,720
was doing HIV care I was combining

240
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,699
anywhere from really a minimum of three

241
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,980
medications but most of the time about

242
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,019
12.

243
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,440
and back then I was combining single

244
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,659
molecule medicines together and they

245
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,480
were toxic I had to be very careful I

246
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,860
was chasing side effects all the time

247
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
um I've been accused of creating

248
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,659
chemical chaos because I'm I'm blending

249
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,579
chemovars of cannabis together that have

250
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:11,219
hundreds of different components in them

251
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,820
and I maintain I don't create chemical

252
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,160
chaos when I trust Mother Nature so I'm

253
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,560
not blending synthetics I'm not blending

254
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,719
isolate I'm not taking the plant apart

255
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,359
isolating it concentrating it in

256
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,580
frankensteining it back together we are

257
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,060
using concentrations that occur in

258
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,060
nature

259
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,480
um so uh

260
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:38,339
I published a paper on the uh mechanisms

261
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,639
of action on how cannabis handles

262
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:45,000
constituents could attenuate what was

263
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,860
going on with covid and long covid

264
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,139
um basically if you're interested this

265
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,879
is kind of a scientific paper it runs

266
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:53,220
through the fact that we have a complex

267
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,980
immune system at the endocannabinoid

268
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,839
system is its Master regulator outcomes

269
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,940
are correlated with inflammatory

270
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,000
responses and we can kind of measure

271
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,279
these with pro-inflammatory cytokines

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,039
goes through some of the mechanisms by

273
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,778
which cannabis can be helpful with

274
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,659
preventing The Binding of the viral

275
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:15,299
Spike protein we up regulate you know a

276
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:18,480
whole bunch of different Pathways anyway

277
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:21,179
if we want to go into detail uh we we

278
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,860
can but I don't have time to do it today

279
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:24,859
I don't think unless we have questions

280
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,200
um

281
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,079
so what did we do we

282
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,879
we applied what we learned here and we

283
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:34,919
produced a product here and if you take

284
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,679
a look on the right hand side of the

285
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,159
slide here this is what we list on every

286
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,139
one of our products just on the bottle

287
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,939
and I know sometimes I'm accused of

288
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:48,240
telling people how to build a clock when

289
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,760
they ask for the time but I think this

290
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,560
is absolutely necessary on the bottle we

291
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,559
do have a barcode or what do you call

292
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,559
them instead of a barcode now uh QR or

293
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,899
something you see I was born in the 60s

294
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,239
um at any rate if you scan the code

295
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,620
you'll come up with our full COA that

296
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,360
not only includes the terpenes

297
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,419
cannabinoids but it's going to go into

298
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,459
the safety of our product as well if you

299
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:14,099
can find a cleaner product than what we

300
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:16,619
have go ahead and buy it and please

301
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,700
don't believe me but listen to me and

302
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,740
compare this so we are from hemp

303
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,320
um and I think everybody here knows that

304
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,200
hemp is cannabis it just has a lower THC

305
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,100
concentration I don't have a schedule

306
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,420
one license and I do want to do research

307
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,220
from the one person I know who has a

308
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,319
schedule one license I don't think I

309
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,440
want one

310
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,260
and I also believe that I can do 90 to

311
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,600
95 percent of the work that cannabis can

312
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:49,200
do medicinally and I can do it with low

313
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,620
THC concentration cannabis that meets

314
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,320
the legal definition of hemp

315
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,360
um so we're federally legal

316
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,040
um there are a lot of talk about dirty

317
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,839
hemp and when people are talking about

318
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,399
dirty hemp

319
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,079
um we're really talking about the

320
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,360
political environment we're not talking

321
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,458
about the plant it's the same plant as

322
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,399
marijuana just different THC

323
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:13,559
concentrations in the issues of dirty

324
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,980
hemp in my opinion are political and

325
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:19,859
they can be resolved with integrity

326
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,740
um a lack of Regulation does occur in

327
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,000
the hemp industry

328
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,820
we take care of that by being

329
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,958
responsible and I also invite folks here

330
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,019
in the room

331
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:33,000
just to think about whether or not there

332
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,100
might be a competing industry to the

333
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,539
Cannabis industry that is trying to pit

334
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,800
the hemp people against the marijuana

335
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,078
people

336
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,240
because state of Colorado has

337
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,039
out-of-state money coming in trying to

338
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,820
cause fights

339
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,458
um

340
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,920
anyway uh that was a dirty issue sorry

341
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:52,078
and the lack of Regulation our goal is

342
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,019
to maintain our products the way Mother

343
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:57,479
Nature Made Them and and really when I

344
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,159
start with the cannabis plant and I keep

345
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,539
it as close to the way Mother Nature

346
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,059
Made it

347
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,939
um I'm starting with a food rather than

348
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:08,699
a poison although we know that dosage is

349
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,279
important but the body knows what to do

350
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,740
with full flower cannabis

351
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,720
um apparently the way we can produce

352
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,220
things is a little bit ahead of what

353
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,440
other people are doing in the industry

354
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:24,120
right now because we do have the ability

355
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,760
to produce wet flour and we use flour

356
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,919
not biomass in our products the reason

357
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,139
for that is the terpene concentrations

358
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:34,439
and their integrity is really important

359
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:36,839
to me and I can't get that kind of

360
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,519
result with biomass although biomass can

361
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,940
produce good medicine it's not what I

362
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,339
use I believe I maintain the enzymes in

363
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,680
the terpenes and flavonoids and the

364
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,079
integrity of this plant much better by

365
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,299
using ambient pressures and ambient

366
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,299
temperatures

367
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:56,519
in the production of our products and

368
00:14:54,299 --> 00:15:00,299
please again don't believe me but listen

369
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,159
to me our coas are very clear and if you

370
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,439
can't read them please reach out to me

371
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,319
and we can guide you through the coas

372
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,120
but we are a transparent company this

373
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,879
product here was designed specifically

374
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,220
for long covet

375
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,620
so it was really focusing on those nine

376
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,220
symptoms that who was saying were the

377
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,860
most common for long covid again

378
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,100
Botanical Fidelity is important to me

379
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,139
we're only using cannabis Blends in our

380
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,778
products so we don't use other

381
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,940
Botanicals in our products I know the

382
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:35,879
FDA doesn't like it but I see it quite

383
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,220
commonly in the field and when you see a

384
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,919
COA that is really sky-high in terpenes

385
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,399
think I think maybe it's not cannabis

386
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:46,799
terpenes so we're not using isolates or

387
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,019
synthetic we're blending full Kim of

388
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,299
ours together

389
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,980
and obviously the CB1 and CB2 receptors

390
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,198
are both important when it comes to Long

391
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,778
covet and our products do contain small

392
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:00,120
amounts of THC

393
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:03,419
um Dr sulak did a beautiful job talking

394
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,120
about low dosing here and ultra low

395
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,759
dosing I've always maintained that the

396
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,220
way cannabis works I look at it in some

397
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,019
ways more like a nutrient than a

398
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,079
medication and sometimes more like a

399
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,639
medication than a nutrient

400
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,859
if you're out and about for a long long

401
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,500
time and you don't get any vitamin C you

402
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,060
might develop scurvy and if you're going

403
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,799
to treat your scurvy you can treat it

404
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:28,319
pretty well with low-dose vitamin C

405
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,019
eating orange maybe take a 150

406
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,180
milligrams of Vitamin C that scurvy

407
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,820
should go away if you want to use

408
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:37,739
vitamin C as an anti-inflammatory it's a

409
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,839
good anti-inflammatory and I've used it

410
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,579
myself

411
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,699
you need to use liposomal preparations

412
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:46,559
or you need to use it IV because bile

413
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:49,620
tolerance can be reached and it's uh

414
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:52,799
it's pretty uncomfortable but it can be

415
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,078
used as an anti-inflammatory so cannabis

416
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,458
is kind of the same way at low doses I

417
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:59,758
really think it balances our

418
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:01,159
endocannabinoid systems and Dr sulak

419
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,539
gave us a beautiful

420
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:07,439
mechanism of action of that through

421
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:09,740
hormesis and at any rate when we start

422
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,058
to use cannabis as an anti-inflammatory

423
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,578
anti-convulsant anti-cancer agent we

424
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:16,740
need to go up higher in the doses but

425
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:19,558
even small doses of getting this plant

426
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,220
into people for any reason I think is a

427
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,220
pretty good idea

428
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,798
um so we took formula C for a test drive

429
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,259
I'm gonna have to speed up maybe a

430
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,879
little bit here we got a really strong

431
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,160
signal

432
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,020
um it was out in the market our chief

433
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,940
Revenue officer talked to a bunch of

434
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:38,460
people he found 10 people who'd used it

435
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,320
for long covet all 10 had a good

436
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,480
response from it

437
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,339
um so that's all perfect it's not you

438
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,079
know scientific information but a couple

439
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,659
of these people actually started crying

440
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,000
on the phone because it had helped them

441
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,298
so much so we took that as a very strong

442
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,919
signal in Formula C and we put together

443
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:57,660
a post marketing because this was

444
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,440
already out in the market by definition

445
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,600
this is a phase four clinical trial we

446
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,660
went through full institutional review

447
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,639
board approval up on

448
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:11,460
clinicaltrials.gov we did not go for an

449
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,759
investigational new drug application and

450
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,038
in so doing I forgave the ability to

451
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,859
patent this product but our patients are

452
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,740
more important than our patents are and

453
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:25,859
so we were able to go into a days for

454
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,960
clinical trial and this product is for

455
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,538
long coveted covet hasn't been going on

456
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,340
that long and we already have a product

457
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:35,220
that has been produced and through a

458
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,659
phase four clinical trial I think you

459
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,960
know we're moving in the right direction

460
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,940
at least I come from a family of

461
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,579
business people we had patents on many

462
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,100
products but we always want in the

463
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:49,558
marketplace so what I'm doing anybody

464
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:51,119
else can do I don't see them doing it

465
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:56,399
right now

466
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:58,859
um but I do believe that it can be done

467
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,100
um let's move on here the trial had two

468
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:05,339
parts to it first part of 28 days either

469
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:08,759
active product or Placebo second part 28

470
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:11,058
days everybody goes over to open label

471
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,058
product

472
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:16,619
um what did we find first 28 days nine

473
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,480
out of nine symptoms improved at the end

474
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:20,399
of the study we had eight out of nine

475
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,700
that have had improved two are

476
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,038
statistically significant over Baseline

477
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:29,400
no serious Adverse Events were noticed

478
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:31,319
and our patients uh Global impression of

479
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,900
change is really pretty impressive we'll

480
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,519
go through a little bit of that here we

481
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,980
do have some follow-up work being done

482
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,940
at the Bateman horn Institute in Utah as

483
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,460
well

484
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,259
and so here's what we found this is kind

485
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,960
of a busy slide

486
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:48,000
um but it shows in the green here where

487
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,919
we reach some statistical significance

488
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,019
again this is over Baseline not over

489
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,080
Placebo I can't go into those reasons

490
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:58,079
right now because I'll be out of time

491
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:00,000
um in the yellow was areas where we

492
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,399
reached clinical significance rather

493
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,140
than statistical

494
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,000
this is the patient Global impression of

495
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,000
change I can't guarantee you people were

496
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,759
doing three times as well but guys this

497
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,140
is a really strong signal something is

498
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,720
