1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710
my gym we're going to be discussing some

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:08,129
metadata about the effects of cannabis

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,199
and cognitive function you know it's

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,639
quite an honor to close the conference

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,678
with your presentation it does feel a

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:15,919
little bit like Jimi Hendrix at

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,919
Woodstock

8
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:21,029
while people settle down I'd also say

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,038
you know this is a controversial issue

10
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:25,890
what effect cannabis has on the brain

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,929
and I encourage you cannabis users not

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,390
to take it personally you know don't be

13
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:34,769
so vain that you you think this data is

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,750
about you so I like to say that I do

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,629
have a disclaimer and that's largely

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,670
because life has been good lately and I

17
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:44,359
do provide consulting advising to

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,870
businesses the government the industry

19
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:53,460
as well as work in academic circles so

20
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:56,609
today I'm going to discuss a little bit

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,620
about cannabis as a factor at health it

22
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,109
can be a good factor it can be a bad

23
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:03,179
factor but ultimately what this data

24
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,558
shows this is a bit of a spoiler so if

25
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,810
you don't out for the rest of the talk

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,118
this is all you really need to know is

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,040
that in the younger you are more

28
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:15,569
cannabis you use more likely there will

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,030
be issues associated with that use but

30
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:21,269
for most individuals cannabis does not

31
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,609
pose a significant health risk but don't

32
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:25,739
appear to be long lasting effects any

33
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:28,530
cognitive deficits appear to go away

34
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,030
with abstinence and all this is what I'm

35
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,180
presenting to you X actually is from a

36
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,310
paper that my colleague Adrian Lee who's

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,210
a student at Oxford for Canada

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:44,759
mathematics PhD have compiled and it is

39
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:46,469
a review on the metadata alright so

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,759
we're going to just kind of go through

41
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:49,140
this a little bit and one of these have

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,239
to remember is that this data is far

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,310
from being predictive there is no like

44
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,989
if you use cannabis this part of your

45
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,299
brain will shrink or this part of your

46
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:59,728
brain will increase in size there's

47
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,380
lacking a lot of longitudinal data so

48
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:04,140
I'm gonna start off with talking about

49
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,209
some cannabis research issues on what

50
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,459
type of data is there we often hear this

51
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:11,479
erroneous thing about there is no

52
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,459
research on cannabis or certain kind

53
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,500
produce all the research on cannabis and

54
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:17,930
things like that but we'll talk about

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,818
some of these spurious correlations and

56
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,319
why you should never use the c-word when

57
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:22,579
you talk about cannabis if you don't

58
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,789
know what that is you'll learn what the

59
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,739
see where it is we'll talk about some of

60
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:29,929
the political and health observations so

61
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:31,670
before we had meta analyses on the

62
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,409
effects of cannabis we have

63
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:35,238
international reports we'll talk about

64
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,189
some of their outcomes and their impacts

65
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,200
and then we'll jump into what these

66
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:42,049
systematic review of some of these

67
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,089
studies what they found and then I'm

68
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:46,670
going to share with you quotes from

69
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,170
researchers about their own research and

70
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:51,108
what they think it means and we'll end

71
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:54,318
with how I stopped you know learn to

72
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:58,099
stop worry and love research on

73
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,539
cognitive effects of cannabis so let's

74
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:02,090
start with this cannabis research issue

75
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:04,068
so always be careful with saying

76
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,799
cannabis causes anything whether it's a

77
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:08,738
therapeutic effect or a negative effect

78
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,870
for this good factor bad factor

79
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:14,209
Association does not equal causation and

80
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,159
we'll go over a number of reasons why

81
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,250
this is not true this is the most common

82
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:24,348
mistake proponents and opponents of any

83
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:27,068
sort of drug legislation or marijuana

84
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:29,388
legalization tend to make so you know

85
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:31,399
cannabis is a factor it's often

86
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,200
associated with things but it is not the

87
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,969
cause of a lot of things I think that's

88
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,310
an important thing to think about is

89
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:42,318
this cannabis as effect so we have our

90
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:44,329
pyramid of data so at the very bottom we

91
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,458
have like case reports and a total

92
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:49,310
reports from the foundation of data

93
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,469
quality then we have our observational

94
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,919
studies these are often like the easiest

95
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:56,840
to do but also are these are some of the

96
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,329
weakest studies in terms of they're here

97
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,829
they're at the mercy of their methods so

98
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,480
if you're relying on self reporting

99
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:04,730
about cannabis use for a financial

100
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,289
incentive hey I'll give you ten bucks if

101
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:08,090
you tell me you use a lot of cannabis

102
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,769
you can see there could be some biases

103
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,409
in that but also a lot of these studies

104
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,329
on cognitive function don't confirm what

105
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:16,788
people are using or if they're actually

106
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,889
using cannabis presently or having the

107
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:20,569
passes a lot of it is all surveillance

108
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,150
these studies have gotten more

109
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:26,209
sophisticated recently and what kind

110
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:27,709
go through their evolution bless you at

111
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:29,930
the top of the pyramid we see more like

112
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:32,918
the randomized controlled studies at the

113
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,840
very top we have reviews and and what a

114
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:37,490
meta-analysis is you take clinical data

115
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,529
individual clinical report like we saw

116
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,600
some dr. Staci Gruber presented a that'd

117
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,309
be one study you take ten of those

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,650
twenty of those forty of those together

119
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,839
you got yourself a meta-analysis but you

120
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:50,810
can treat them as one study and look for

121
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,728
similarities but it's very very

122
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,168
difficult so you wrote this article for

123
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:56,389
nature last month which is discussed

124
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,680
that while there is research allows of

125
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,449
candidates there are these terrific

126
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,250
hoops that they live on fire that you

127
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,978
can jump through to be able to do

128
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,990
cannabis research you still really it's

129
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:09,139
not legal to study products on the

130
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,120
market if you're federally funded so and

131
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:12,860
you'll see disclaimers if you look for

132
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,509
them in publications about cannabis

133
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,400
varieties we'll say here's the chemical

134
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:18,139
profile of the plant but due to

135
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,149
regulations in the state we cannot

136
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,870
publish any of the physiological data

137
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:25,069
because it's still federally illegal

138
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,538
just a fun fact I know many people

139
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:28,459
assertive unfamiliar with drug

140
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:31,250
scheduling but just as a fun fact but I

141
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:32,750
like to throw this up there THC actually

142
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,240
appears in three different scheduling

143
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,430
categories why nobody really knows the

144
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,470
past FDA there's no clear answer on this

145
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,209
but if it appears in the marijuana plant

146
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,120
it's a Schedule one if it's a liquid

147
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:45,649
form by syndra's as scheduled - it is

148
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,899
purified in a pill that's Schedule three

149
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:52,069
and then way by itself and schedule five

150
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:53,598
we have a dial answer purify it CBD but

151
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:55,848
again these are the sort of the

152
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:58,009
limitations of research we don't see a

153
00:05:55,848 --> 00:06:01,069
lot of products here that are on the

154
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:03,139
market the current sort of holy grail of

155
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,829
medical cannabis among a lot of circles

156
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,569
is National Academy of Sciences report

157
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:11,658
again and this is really nice because it

158
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:13,129
does provide some conclusions about what

159
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:15,379
cannabis will be effective for there's

160
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:17,478
the whole three plus one right it's been

161
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:20,269
shown to be effective for pain multiple

162
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:22,908
sclerosis and other evidence as well

163
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:25,158
including a late one addition to that

164
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:27,918
was for pediatric epilepsy it also

165
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:30,168
contains some associations

166
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,180
it doesn't say cannabis causes mental

167
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:32,870
health issues but it is associated it's

168
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,509
a fact

169
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,550
in this way to be very careful by just

170
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:40,579
you know getting upset at people who say

171
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,090
it causes psychosis or causes violence

172
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:45,409
because we lose the ability to develop

173
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:47,000
studies that you own if you're looking

174
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,310
for extreme effects of cannabis you will

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,759
under power your study to be able to

176
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,319
detect those and why why do I tell am i

177
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,689
talking about associations so much

178
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,389
well wrote an article for project CBD

179
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:01,399
called channeling and slinger

180
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,310
you know cracks in a crackpot theory

181
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:06,228
about a pop book and there's a lot of

182
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,149
spurious correlations out there I just

183
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:09,709
put up a few here for posterity say

184
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:11,359
you're welcome to take a picture but

185
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:14,629
there there's so many out there

186
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,060
for example ice cream sales increase as

187
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:18,740
do drowning deaths on the same day

188
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,019
you know the ice cream sales are not

189
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,590
count causing the drowning deaths there

190
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:26,240
might be relations there having a high

191
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:27,918
intelligence is actually linked to

192
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,620
developing mental illness later in life

193
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,599
getting straight A's in high school is

194
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,209
linked to developing ADHD this doesn't

195
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,160
cause it but it is linked there so let

196
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:39,109
me make these correlations and think

197
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,630
about them really really think about it

198
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,430
I mean you know high blood pressure is

199
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:46,370
linked to violence high blood pressures

200
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,660
are causing the violence so there's some

201
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,430
things I think of it as you go out in

202
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,500
the world and are trying to disentangle

203
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,538
some of the messaging about cannabis

204
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,759
especially with what's going on with

205
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:58,490
product safety concerns if you know

206
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,529
cannabis and it's decisions are a factor

207
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,139
probably not the cause but what they

208
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:04,699
aren't present so we're gonna talk a

209
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:07,009
little bit about and this is coming

210
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,529
straight out of the paper a review not

211
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:12,348
only of the clinical cannabis and

212
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:14,839
cognition studies but what have we seen

213
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:17,120
before these meta-analysis and basically

214
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,310
these are the Commission and Academy

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,019
report so the Indian hemp drug

216
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,139
Commission's which is a very short

217
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:26,180
report and with the digital access today

218
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:28,460
you can read an original copy of it

219
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,209
online but basically it said you know

220
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:33,168
cannabis there was a lot of cannabis use

221
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,089
going on and people were really

222
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:38,028
concerned about it was the cause of

223
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,800
violence and murders and also and mental

224
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:42,500
health issues it turns out that the

225
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:46,309
Commission concluded it was it and that

226
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,860
was far more widespread than anyone had

227
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:51,279
ever considered across classic costs

228
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:55,279
religious values in the cross cultures

229
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,559
following up to that was a 1925 Panama

230
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,879
Canal Zone report and basically they

231
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,829
conclude a very similar thing you know

232
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,379
this is not the cause of all societies

233
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,930
mills and they shortly refill out the

234
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:09,289
military personnel to carry cannabis on

235
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:11,779
them because of the perception shortly

236
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:14,209
after that in the u.s. due to concerns

237
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,549
of you know this is when you saw kind of

238
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,769
henry Anslinger coming rising to fame

239
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:20,479
and his ill same things like you we use

240
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,059
cannabis and you'll fall under the

241
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,200
influence of listening to jazz and they

242
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:27,769
say you only have to do something about

243
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,930
this this is the first time you ever saw

244
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:33,860
cannabis or hemp being described as a

245
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:36,139
narcotic words like addict and addiction

246
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,659
were replaced by a moral street user and

247
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:40,549
don't feed and we start to see these

248
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:42,350
gears or the turn and how people

249
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:47,659
discussed and perceived it it was blamed

250
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:50,210
for causing a lot of societal issues we

251
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:53,000
fast forward to the the LaGuardia report

252
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:55,910
which is again Fiorello LaGuardia was a

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,070
beloved mayor of New York his name

254
00:09:55,909 --> 00:10:01,219
actually literally means little plant

255
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,840
and he commissioned this report done by

256
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,860
the National Academy of scientists have

257
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,970
found that there was nothing to

258
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:12,740
substantiate these claims about cannabis

259
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:14,840
causing negative effects shortly after

260
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,060
that there was under Nixon the Shafer

261
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,330
Commission report as it's commonly known

262
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:22,039
another bloke politician said you know

263
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,330
after doing their own research looking

264
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,029
at all available evidence they said it

265
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,680
should be decriminalized and it doesn't

266
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,199
constitute a major public health threat

267
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,519
which is why it ended up in schedule one

268
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,440
shortly after that

269
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,649
so it's you know disconnect between the

270
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,060
science and the policy they're

271
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:40,159
fast-forwarding I'm gonna skip one of

272
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:43,219
the National Academy reports from 1999

273
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,289
but the most recent one as we know has

274
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,899
shown that cannabis is effective based

275
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:51,589
on looking at you know tens of thousands

276
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:53,449
of articles on the subject so what about

277
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,830
cannabis use in the brain well I'm going

278
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,970
to go through a little bit of a history

279
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,180
here

280
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,250
and take some liberties with what these

281
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:03,469
people may have said a little bit this

282
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,659
is our clinical distillation and then

283
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,340
I'll share after this like I said quotes

284
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:11,509
from the researchers from their own

285
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:14,300
articles about this stuff so Nadia so

286
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:16,549
Louise is a brilliant researcher threw

287
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:18,289
the gauntlet down in 1999 with her book

288
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:20,750
cannabis at cognitive function there was

289
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:23,779
really nothing available at the time I

290
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,149
have even used this handbook to design

291
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:28,069
studies and around memory retention and

292
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:29,899
reaction times camps a very useful book

293
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,640
but it did conclude that the weight of

294
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:34,879
the evidence suggests that you know

295
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,069
cannabis does not result in any severe

296
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,470
or gross debilitating impairment of

297
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,540
cognitive function right regardless sort

298
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,550
of the amount of use remember these are

299
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:45,919
just surveys people who are admitted to

300
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:48,379
using cannabis and they're putting them

301
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:52,519
through a battery of cognitive and IQ

302
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:53,929
tests following that study another

303
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,639
person said well you know there are

304
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:58,339
metabolic changes and we look at all

305
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,710
these observational reports but there's

306
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,590
so many discrepancies like some cannabis

307
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,629
users their IQ increases over time some

308
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,070
decrease what you know this is one of

309
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:09,139
the things is used there's a really

310
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,930
poorly done study that talks about

311
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:14,629
cannabis users experience at eight

312
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:16,489
points of IQ decrease over time if you

313
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:18,470
look at this statistic on that it's plus

314
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,360
or minus 8 IQ points they're the

315
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,700
greatest increases and the greatest

316
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:28,220
decreases over time from the group so a

317
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:30,410
lot of discrepancies hope in 2003 or - I

318
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,240
can't read it from here to us - he

319
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:34,370
actually threw another novel down so

320
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,169
actually you know what during impairment

321
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,450
there are changes to the brain there's

322
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:40,339
changes to how the brain is functioning

323
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,890
and how it's adapting and having a ton

324
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,139
of THC floating around in there but any

325
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,299
measurable effect in the clinic

326
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,580
disappears after about 28 days of

327
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:52,250
absence you cannot detect it through a

328
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:56,120
battery of cognitive tests regardless of

329
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,740
the amount of use another researcher

330
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,210
seemed to conclude something similar

331
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,528
saying well there's a small magnitude of

332
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,050
a

333
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:05,139
here especially while people are using

334
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:06,729
it actively using cannabis but if

335
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:09,100
cannabis does have therapeutic effects

336
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:12,249
this is an acceptable margin of safety

337
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,980
for a medicine like this Sola we came

338
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,389
back almost ten years later and said you

339
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,110
guys are all wrong

340
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:21,188
there's actually impairment past 28 days

341
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,769
but I don't know what it means because

342
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:25,149
it's not significant but there really

343
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,068
she really counted that there are

344
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:29,860
effects on the brain but they didn't

345
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:32,318
seem to be clinically impacting any of

346
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:36,699
the battery tests that were administered

347
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:38,860
to people then we started to see a

348
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:40,049
change in 2006 with the meta-analysis

349
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,740
teams became more sophisticated

350
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:46,120
equipment became more sensitive quick

351
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,490
fallen colleagues were like actually

352
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,528
we're seeing adaptive changes of the

353
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,970
brain from long-term cannabis and if you

354
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:54,068
went to Stacy troopers talk today you

355
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,660
got to see some of that data and some of

356
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:57,068
the differences when you start to drill

357
00:13:55,659 --> 00:14:00,009
down or people using this as an

358
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:01,419
intoxicant or as is a medicine there can

359
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,860
actually be significant changes they

360
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:07,899
started to draw a line a little bit

361
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:09,490
about their so and we started to see a

362
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,730
couple papers you know the next one

363
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,740
they're looking at these effects which

364
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,480
are associate with heavy use of cannabis

365
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,938
that yeah there are changes in the brain

366
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,399
if while they are using cannabis but

367
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:22,389
there are adaptive changes in the brace

368
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,448
you're not just saying an

369
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:30,549
across-the-board atrophy of the brain or

370
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:32,049
things like that and you know they're

371
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:35,008
basically starts to build up that there

372
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:38,109
is minimal evidence of these long-term

373
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:39,818
effects and some researchers started to

374
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,178
look back through this data at about

375
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:45,000
this time 2009 they discovered that some

376
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:47,259
of the studies that had found a

377
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,818
difference of significant difference in

378
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:51,639
the effect of cannabis on brain we're

379
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:54,250
actually looking at two sets of data

380
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,350
that were identical from Finland they

381
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,698
actually had combined them this one to

382
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,558
come it was one to six it's like oh we

383
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:01,479
have two men analyses but they pick two

384
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:03,909
groups they combine it so there was a

385
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,110
correction they're done and they said

386
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:06,519
actually there's no differences in

387
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,649
global measurements

388
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:15,669
and brain volume and there's not a lot

389
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:19,689
of evidence there as well so moving

390
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:22,059
forward closer to our time you know

391
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,260
there is residual effects people have

392
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:25,809
thought but one of the things that came

393
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:30,970
up around this time was that if users

394
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:32,500
reported using CBD again just reported

395
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,220
like this literally questionnaire do you

396
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,620
use cannabis that contains CBD

397
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,019
surprisingly these patients or users in

398
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,669
New Zealand did not have any cognitive

399
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:45,819
deficits regardless how much THC

400
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:48,549
cannabis they use which seems a little

401
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,690
weird because you know if you know

402
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:51,370
anything about cannabis you know there's

403
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,140
always a little bit of CBD in there is

404
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,669
that what's doing it or you know they

405
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:58,779
did not test any of the products of

406
00:15:54,669 --> 00:16:00,459
history we're using so again we start to

407
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:03,220
see more refinement of these things

408
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,139
people are began really thinking about

409
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,910
what abstinence means from candidates

410
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:07,870
due to its half-life on the body and how

411
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:11,769
long it stays there

412
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,889
not seeing cognitive impacts after

413
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:17,019
abstinence

414
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:18,610
you know chronic cannabis use may or may

415
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,889
not alter brain structure this was a

416
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,570
conclusion from a research study because

417
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:24,699
they saw it in some people but not

418
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,379
others remember they're not controlling

419
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,810
for things like how they're

420
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:30,789
administering it what they're using are

421
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:32,469
they getting it from a legal market or

422
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,209
getting it from an illicit market is it

423
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,740
tested for things they don't even

424
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,620
confirming if they're actually using

425
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,139
cannabis and a lot of times these are

426
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,210
confounded as some of these studies are

427
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:44,590
I'm sharing here more recently because

428
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,389
they would go to New Zealand and other

429
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,830
European countries and do these studies

430
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:50,080
to try and see if they could find the

431
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,480
same effects what they call a joint in

432
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,120
Europe and New Zealand Australia is not

433
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,730
what you call it here in California but

434
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,500
a joint out there is a lot of tobacco

435
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,180
with a little bit of cannabis sprinkled

436
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,159
in it and once they controlled for that

437
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,838
a lot of their effects disappeared

438
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:07,750
especially in the effects panel essence

439
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:10,029
so you know tobacco you seem to be more

440
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,759
highly associated with many of these

441
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,740
cognitive deficits impairments and you

442
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:18,029
know less academic achievement and

443
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,549
things like that a lot

444
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:22,828
researchers started to think about what

445
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:24,629
is the mechanism of this data how is it

446
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:25,649
translated and they says that you know

447
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,800
this means that there is a lot of

448
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:32,070
causality here it is a factor it can't

449
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,849
be a good factor or a bad bad factor but

450
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:38,429
you know the regular use of cannabinoids

451
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:40,409
exerts structural and you know changes

452
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,200
in the brain that all seems to be

453
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,480
temporary and transitory you know we

454
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,980
have you know our brains are very neuro

455
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,529
adaptive and it's taken a while for

456
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,990
people to accept that stem cells it's a

457
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:53,339
relatively new thing before the 1990s

458
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,069
people just thought hey you had brain

459
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,480
cells eventually he'll lose them all but

460
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:58,889
now we know that they get replaced by

461
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,079
stem cells they don't just sort of

462
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:05,220
slough off like leaves on a tree than

463
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:08,759
you're done one day so they started in

464
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,740
look more and more at acute THC and

465
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:12,569
another group found that there is

466
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,529
evidence for a protective effect from

467
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,139
cannabidiol

468
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:18,690
so if patient if people in these studies

469
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,430
observations report using CBD they don't

470
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,779
see them performing poorly in these

471
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,210
cognitive tests they don't see the

472
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:31,139
differences in brain bond it's much much

473
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:33,660
less likely and so when it gets stiff

474
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,509
functional alterations it started to be

475
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:40,710
more and more cemented that these

476
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:43,440
findings are largely compensatory for

477
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:47,309
the brain to adapt in a life of swimming

478
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,700
in THC and so these changes go back to

479
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:54,659
baseline or to other levels after say 30

480
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,069
days or so of use yeah and a little bit

481
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,769
more the same I know it gets a little

482
00:18:56,069 --> 00:19:04,259
redundant but as we start to come to a

483
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:07,500
crash here in 2018 and 2019 people start

484
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:09,150
to try and Link candidates to it's very

485
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,279
specific changes in the crane and

486
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:14,370
they're they're failing there's a lot of

487
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,230
issues here there see things are not

488
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:19,679
expecting they're seeing increases

489
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,720
decreases across the board so there is a

490
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:26,640
reason why and I'll get to that in just

491
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,319
a second so when we think about cannabis

492
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
and themes from this metadata I know I

493
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,799
flew through it

494
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,869
that of the day I want to keep you guys

495
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,690
here too much but basically cannabis use

496
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:38,539
is associated with changes in the brain

497
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,820
and that is from acute use if you're

498
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:43,879
impaired on cannabis oddly going to

499
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:45,759
perform poorly on a variety of cognitive

500
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,230
tasks especially if it's just pure THC

501
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:51,140
that is something that's been shown

502
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,230
fairly conclusive however it seems to

503
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,280
differ with experience tolerance and

504
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,710
things like that so when you talk about

505
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,990
cannabis naive users are getting exposed

506
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:03,350
to th so you will see effects less

507
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,150
likely in people who have used it but

508
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:06,919
again this stuff is far from predictive

509
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,110
you know it's science I'm always trying

510
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,450
to figure out how to predict things how

511
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:14,240
things will behave what will be the

512
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,069
outcome you know that's why you know

513
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,410
astronomy Rose the power to predict the

514
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:20,119
phases of the Moon right really far from

515
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,980
that with this brain to skin so if you

516
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,808
can't say a child who's using a lot of

517
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,849
cannabis is going to have this part of

518
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:27,950
their brain be affected we know for sure

519
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:30,109
it's far from predictive we don't have

520
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:33,440
the ability to identify who's at risk

521
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:35,449
and who isn't but one of the biggest

522
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,029
issues with this data and why we decided

523
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,860
to write this paper was in response to a

524
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:43,670
science fiction book that was published

525
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:45,589
earlier this year and basically when you

526
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,370
when researchers go out there and are

527
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:50,599
trying to take hyperbolic messaging and

528
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,889
inflammatory messaging and then just

529
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,289
sort of dramatic sensationalistic

530
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,240
headlines and you use that to guide

531
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:58,308
their research their data their

532
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,109
experiments design would be under power

533
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:04,009
to find those results I'll give you an

534
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:06,589
example if you believe say just bear

535
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:08,359
with me a cannabis use even a single

536
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:10,549
one-time use will cause irreversible

537
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,678
changes to the brain lead to psychosis

538
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:15,529
and violence and you say that the study

539
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,470
to find it you're probably going to have

540
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:20,359
a really tough time finding evidence for

541
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,160
that right but if you start to ask more

542
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,928
subtle questions about whether or not

543
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,460
it's a factor and what is the good

544
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:26,900
factor of that I start to drill down a

545
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,799
little bit you might actually generate

546
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:34,160
some good data but you know don't take

547
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,409
Adrian and ice words for it we're going

548
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:42,830
to talk some quotes from the researchers

549
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:45,320
about their own research so so one of

550
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:48,049
the authors we talked about this grant

551
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:49,849
makan and so basically said current

552
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:52,159
human observations on the effect of

553
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:55,869
marijuana for cannabis on development

554
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,160
are sparse and contradictory you know

555
00:21:55,869 --> 00:22:01,369
very very interesting so they're the

556
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:06,050
result of our meta-analysis study to

557
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:10,129
reveal I see a substantial effect of

558
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:11,990
long-term effects on cannabis yeah you

559
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,850
know basically they're saying they can't

560
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,009
find it there I see I can think I can

561
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:17,809
read this next one I apologize the way

562
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:20,720
of the evidence suggests that long-term

563
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:22,970
use of cannabis does not result in any

564
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,579
severe gross ability aiding impairment

565
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,860
of cognitive function actual quote and

566
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:30,289
she's done a lot of these observational

567
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:35,319
studies and meta analyses you know the

568
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:38,539
long-term risks do not appeal sorry

569
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:40,519
intermediate risk for most users are not

570
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:43,579
severe and their effects are remarkably

571
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:45,829
subtle so again these are actual quotes

572
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:48,230
from researchers about their papers and

573
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:51,019
again was cherry picked and taken out of

574
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,750
context a skill I learned from each

575
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:56,420
Andrew so who is like the god added on

576
00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:00,890
if you read any of his work but my she's

577
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:02,750
he phenomenal at this so why do they see

578
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,850
these differences in these studies some

579
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:07,819
studies see in effect a dramatic like

580
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:09,379
some don't some see this impairment some

581
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,689
don't what what are some of the factors

582
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:15,230
so in our paper it wasn't just a you

583
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,809
know unload on this these studies but to

584
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,250
try and make them better so one of the

585
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,250
things that you really have to start

586
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,500
asking about it maybe even testing for

587
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,180
is what are people using what it's the

588
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,369
chemo type of candidates and how are

589
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,060
they delivering it another really

590
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:33,259
overlooked aspect is genetics genetics

591
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:36,649
especially pharmacogenetics the mouse

592
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:38,900
Hafsa is dirt cheap it's easy to do it's

593
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,390
rapid you can some places do it in-house

594
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,009
there we collaborate with a sexual

595
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,380
health clinic in New York they have

596
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:47,359
on-site genetic testing from certain

597
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,970
markers this is really easy to do and

598
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,719
the reasoning

599
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:53,490
this is your how fast you metabolize THC

600
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,620
could play a role in how often you use

601
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,859
it and the effect so there's a whole

602
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:00,599
spectrum of people yeah low like very

603
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:02,339
people who metabolize stuff really

604
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,339
really slowly you have sup to metabolize

605
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:07,648
up really fast if you're using cannabis

606
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,869
you know just conceptually one person

607
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:11,339
might get smoked 20 joints a day and not

608
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:13,378
feeling well one person might have a

609
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,569
little bit of cannabis but stays in

610
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:18,558
their system a really really long time

611
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:20,638
the other thing is defining withdrawal

612
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:23,038
for cannabis which is again it's

613
00:24:20,638 --> 00:24:25,798
controversial but when do you consider

614
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,778
someone cleared out of cannabis when is

615
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,839
that some people say 20 days some people

616
00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:33,750
say 30 in those studies it range some

617
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,668
people had no apparent cognitive

618
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,609
deficits that could be detected 7 hours

619
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:41,340
some people that lasted 20 days what are

620
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:43,048
those differences this also isn't a lot

621
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:45,509
of longitudinal data here they're not

622
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:47,940
looking at before and after people

623
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:52,110
initiate cannabis but this never

624
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:54,899
happened and so that would be two veils

625
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:57,178
and also objective measures of use how

626
00:24:54,898 --> 00:24:59,158
are people using this is you know if you

627
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,950
use it one time or you included this

628
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,230
study what is the cutoff and what is a

629
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:07,019
cannabis user you'll see this term used

630
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,389
without ever being defined in a study

631
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,919
day this is the user group and it's like

632
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:12,990
willing to use like five times in the

633
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,919
last year maybe its whole life this is

634
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:19,079
that a user there really is not a good

635
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,389
discussion there gender differences are

636
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:25,378
also an important thing to control in

637
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:27,148
these studies men and women respond to

638
00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:29,308
cannabis differently and even endorse

639
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:31,258
different positive and negative aspects

640
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:33,388
of cannabis use in terms of relations

641
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:37,019
with their family effects on job and

642
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:38,819
things like that and that's something

643
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:40,798
that's not often taken to account when

644
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:44,339
you love all these brain scans and

645
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:47,220
observational studies together I'd also

646
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:50,009
say do not really rely on IQ scores

647
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,730
especially don't use them alone now my Q

648
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:54,690
scores and IQ testing has been misused

649
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,118
throughout the history of the United

650
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,740
States we really got it wrong I don't

651
00:25:57,118 --> 00:26:00,259
know if you knows but they used to be on

652
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,190
the IQ test or M

653
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,650
it's coming in through Ellis Island

654
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,750
you'd begin a list of names you had to

655
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,660
identify which one was a New York Yankee

656
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:11,119
that was part of the IQ test and so what

657
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,370
IQ tests are incredibly subjective and

658
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,109
based on cultural values like complete

659
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:17,839
this picture that could be a picture of

660
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:21,229
an airplane or a pipe or some sort of

661
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:26,359
object so these tests are notoriously

662
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:29,089
unreliable and they're not intended to

663
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:31,849
establish someone's words or criminality

664
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:33,109
it really went on IQ test is the only

665
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:35,089
thing I can really compare it to would

666
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:36,349
be like going to ophthalmology

667
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:39,798
appointment and getting a prescription

668
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:41,539
for glasses that is the only intent in

669
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:45,410
the only way that's ever been approved

670
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:47,119
to use IQ tests really is to correct

671
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,950
identifying correct learning

672
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,139
disabilities much like you might correct

673
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:54,470
your vision by going to see an eye

674
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,500
doctor you also need to adjust for body

675
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:59,808
size this was perhaps the most shocking

676
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,089
thing different people of different

677
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:04,428
heights will have different brain sizes

678
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:06,889
and so let's imagine you got a bunch of

679
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:08,720
tall people who don't use cannabis with

680
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,540
a bunch of short people who do cannabis

681
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,640
you might be like my gosh these cannabis

682
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:15,619
users have really small brains quit

683
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,880
supply and this is something that has

684
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:18,859
never been controlled for in these

685
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,809
studies so again something else really

686
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:23,779
simple it seems to make intuitive sense

687
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:25,339
brain and body size are linked why not

688
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:27,980
adjust for that in these studies

689
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:29,980
especially small ones the biggest one

690
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,720
the biggest ask I've had is

691
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,669
pre-registration how are you going to

692
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,380
conduct this study you can put it online

693
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:38,990
and have people from the community

694
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,580
review and make recommendations so you

695
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,220
can incorporate all these things I'm

696
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:45,048
talking about but I think that that is

697
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,079
one of the things you really want to

698
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:50,150
adjust in the future is getting the idea

699
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,730
of we live in this community it's very

700
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,290
accessible you want to do a study post

701
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,298
the methodology and how you're going to

702
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:58,779
do it online so that you can make sure

703
00:27:56,298 --> 00:28:03,029
you're not you know

704
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:06,129
confirming your own bias and vacuum so

705
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:09,490
again just to reiterate about these

706
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,960
studies you know THC or cannabis this is

707
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,370
not debatable it does lead to

708
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,990
intoxication it is associated with

709
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:19,658
impairment and temporary alterations in

710
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:23,380
brain signaling if it wasn't it wouldn't

711
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:24,909
have fair pubic effects you know more

712
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,740
like a lot of whom say THC is not

713
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:28,990
psychoactive it's like well it goes into

714
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,909
the brain and it's certain receptors the

715
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,470
same targets as anti-anxiety medication

716
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,299
it goes in the brand it's adenosine the

717
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,089
same target as caffeine it alters

718
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:39,759
cognition right even if it's improving

719
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:43,109
cognition that's still psychoactive so

720
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:46,658
again it's an on a toxic ating component

721
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:49,269
again all the effects of cannabis in

722
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:51,460
terms of deficits impairment appear

723
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:54,279
reversible and time who has never been

724
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,529
any confirmation that there are severe

725
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:58,629
debilitating conditions we actually used

726
00:28:56,529 --> 00:29:00,460
some of this data to sue the DEA a few

727
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:03,370
years ago to change their website they

728
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,860
changed some of these things because on

729
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:07,769
their website actually said a single use

730
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:10,329
of cannabis leads to irreversible

731
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:12,400
changes on the brain or irreversible

732
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:15,879
toxic effects to use their terminology

733
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,280
but in their denial of the petition to

734
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,539
reschedule cannabis they actually cited

735
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,569
other research that said there were no

736
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:24,700
lasting cognitive impacts and in you

737
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:25,269
know in the case we visually said well

738
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,069
which is it

739
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:29,259
are there no lasting impacts from

740
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:31,569
cannabis on the brain or does a single

741
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:33,700
use permanently change the brain there's

742
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,288
about 20 points that they ended up

743
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:39,940
changing on the website in terms of

744
00:29:35,288 --> 00:29:43,058
claims about these things so the main

745
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,610
takeaway is that the the clinical impact

746
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:48,308
of cannabis on the brain and cognitive

747
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,689
function is inconsistent and and you

748
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:50,980
could probably appreciate a little bit

749
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,630
more why because this these

750
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,950
observational studies are like a Hail

751
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:58,240
Mary pass to figure something out and

752
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,100
we've reached a point where they're not

753
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,159
really helpful anymore they're getting

754
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:05,439
tingly misused in the media getting used

755
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,240
to influence policy but you know give

756
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,529
you an example

757
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,019
Massachusetts wanted to propose putting

758
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:11,920
cannabis may cause psychosis on a

759
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,109
cannabis

760
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,360
well you know what put it in there with

761
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:18,669
the other 30 warnings that no one's ever

762
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:20,919
going to read ever if I did a study

763
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,950
right these release these piece will

764
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,690
relate to the party because a study came

765
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,580
out saying that even experienced

766
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,620
cannabis users cannot comprehend

767
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:31,389
labeling of a lot of cannabis products

768
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:33,459
and the labeling and warning labels

769
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:36,310
actually covers up useful information

770
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,960
like dosing dosing size how much in the

771
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:40,119
prize in the product and how long the

772
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,370
effects last for and most experienced

773
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:43,869
users could even identify the universal

774
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:47,500
symbol for a product containing

775
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:49,389
marijuana a more rational sense solution

776
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,220
to this would be to rotate the warning

777
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,800
labels like you see on tobacco and other

778
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:59,710
products versus listing all 30 of them

779
00:30:53,799 --> 00:31:05,379
on a 1 you know 10 milligram serving so

780
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:06,910
I guess you know in conclusion we really

781
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,370
start to have to start controlling these

782
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,410
studies better and not jumping and

783
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:13,899
dropping the c-word about cannabis and

784
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:16,050
really fight back on anyone who talks

785
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,700
about positive effects of cannabis

786
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:23,049
things are associated things are linked

787
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:26,080
and thinks are factors and with that I'd

788
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:28,750
say please feel free to email me I'm

789
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:33,099
happy to share this presentation and to

790
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:40,660
take any questions thank you

791
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:43,369
[Applause]

792
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,080
well I've answered all your curiosities

793
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:46,699
about candidates on the brain it jobs my

794
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:51,639
first time ever give me this top so

795
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,640
that's pretty good alright

796
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:14,969
yes a lot of these studies claim to look

797
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:18,000
at healthy populations and they try to

798
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,440
control for diseases but yes there's

799
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,409
there's a lot of these very interesting

800
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,570
case reports of people who say severe

801
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:26,220
muscular disorders it was a truck driver

802
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:29,129
in Germany he couldn't pass his driving

803
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:32,250
test cos of muscle spasticity and he

804
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:36,809
passed and got his license with a very

805
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:40,288
called a very legal amount of THC in

806
00:32:36,808 --> 00:32:43,259
your blood like a skyrocket amount of it

807
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:45,359
and so yeah we have to think about the

808
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:46,919
context of use when it comes to this

809
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,990
because there are a lot of studies where

810
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,100
people who again if you have suffer from

811
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:54,720
tremors and it approves your tremors

812
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:57,209
that is a case and even with visual

813
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,548
processing and cannabis on the brain

814
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,288
cannabis seems to affect the mechanics

815
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:03,778
of the eye but not the actual visual

816
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:06,359
processing of information that is a

817
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:10,740
great point yes sir

818
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:13,439
hi Christian associate when you when you

819
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,288
do your MIT analysis how do you factor

820
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,330
in the political environment right

821
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,980
because we've seen it in your own slides

822
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,379
we've heard it a few times I think in

823
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,750
the conference you know a lot of it is

824
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,679
about the governor and the rules that he

825
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:31,859
puts in his state and or hers and and

826
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,990
you end up with a lot of skewed science

827
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:35,668
essentially apparently according also I

828
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,740
believe to some of the examples you are

829
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:41,940
given so when you do the meta-analysis

830
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:44,190
do you classify politically which gets

831
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,769
obviously very dangerous what how do you

832
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:51,259
do what you do with that data interpret

833
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:54,388
that yeah that's an interesting question

834
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:56,028
ultimately you want to start thinking

835
00:33:54,388 --> 00:33:57,869
more about how do you generate

836
00:33:56,028 --> 00:34:01,829
scientific information that will

837
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:04,638
actually influence policy and this is is

838
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:04,638
very difficult

839
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:09,418
yeah there is no I don't think there

840
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:11,849
really is an answer how do you factor in

841
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,829
political information you can definitely

842
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:16,470
tell when you read some of these papers

843
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:19,949
like man they have a chip on their

844
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:20,609
shoulder about this issue there are

845
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:23,699
implicit

846
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:27,200
and I think you know as humans we're

847
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:32,519
kind of evolved to look for patterns and

848
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:33,779
and people are being really lazy out

849
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:35,880
there with a lot of this data to be

850
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,760
quite frank a nature is lazy right so

851
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:42,329
official have said so it's human nature

852
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,400
and so part of that I think it is by not

853
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:47,130
being lazy and by doing your due

854
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,559
diligence around this work because it

855
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:51,780
wasn't the researchers who combined the

856
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,579
same population twice there were like

857
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,380
oops they're like well hey this is

858
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,920
politically good for us to show this

859
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,840
effect so it was other researchers who

860
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,820
had the guts to step up and say actually

861
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,519
you made a mistake here let's correct

862
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,640
this so I think if you find a mistake in

863
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,630
the literature find a mistake out there

864
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,609
you know it happens all the time

865
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,500
something that people just accept

866
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,059
something they hear all the time they

867
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,150
just don't question it gets cited

868
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:19,559
repeated repeated repeated you know I

869
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,639
think that's what it's going to take and

870
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,070
more people are being more comfortable

871
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:26,000
with taking those stances

872
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:29,370
so also I'll assume that motor

873
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,739
impairment also varies greatly among

874
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:35,309
individuals including you know their

875
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:37,019
abilities to drive a car I also

876
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:40,289
understand a breathalyser who's also

877
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:43,889
about to hit the market so you know is

878
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:45,239
that is that technology that whatever

879
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:47,219
we're going to face is it going to be

880
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,489
accurate or a lot of the people gonna be

881
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:53,189
swept up or not impaired and what are we

882
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:58,500
looking at in in that realm I think

883
00:35:53,190 --> 00:36:01,470
there is for those devices but it also

884
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,619
you know begs the question of there are

885
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:06,859
a real aside from alcohol just to speak

886
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:10,769
simply about blood levels no other

887
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:13,800
pharmaceutical drug blood levels do not

888
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:15,840
correlate to impairment it's very

889
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,880
surprising right there isn't if this was

890
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,090
the case you'd have a benzodiazepine an

891
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,829
opioid roadside sobriety test right

892
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,559
doesn't exist

893
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:28,440
why because blood levels do not

894
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:31,318
correlate to impairment and also the

895
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,539
thing is if you're using a product

896
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:37,150
CBD rich with a little bit of THC you

897
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:39,490
could get popped for the THC content

898
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:43,210
product they're not testing for CBD as

899
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:44,469
well it's a very broad stroke the some

900
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,358
of the ones that concern me are

901
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:48,639
definitely false positives you might get

902
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:51,219
especially the mouth swaps like you

903
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,768
might never have touched cannabis but be

904
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:55,088
around people the vapor vampires are the

905
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:57,518
people who just changed smoking cannabis

906
00:36:55,088 --> 00:37:00,518
and you could fail one of those mouth

907
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:02,199
swab tests but they do have their I

908
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:05,889
think they do have their applications

909
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:07,659
and potentially looking at recent use

910
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:09,358
but there still are some issues of how

911
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:14,108
do you address the most positives and

912
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:15,788
what's the goal here we did a study with

913
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,828
American Chemical Society that we talked

914
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:20,140
about where we suggested that the

915
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:22,359
roadside sobriety test that's already

916
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:24,699
used the horizontal gaze and the

917
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:27,159
three-point turn walk is actually more

918
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:30,608
reliable than urine or blood testing it

919
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:32,288
but detecting impairment for all

920
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:34,119
substances I mean you could be too

921
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:37,539
sleepy to drive you could still be

922
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,210
classified as impaired so there are a

923
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:42,160
number of reasons there but as a

924
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,599
confirmation about the substance that

925
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,219
people were using at the time of being

926
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,798
impaired that's probably in Seoul's

927
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:51,879
menus but I think those devices have a

928
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:54,130
long way to go but again law enforcement

929
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,680
party has a great tool that's routinely

930
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:59,650
used to check for impairment and whether

931
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:05,649
or not you can drive regardless of the

932
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:09,210
reason but I will help anyone develop a

933
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,210
breathalyzer that it's looking to do it

934
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:14,049
yeah I think they're used clinically as

935
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,309
is also potentially in these

936
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:16,778
observational studies if you could

937
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:18,190
convert quickly whether or not people

938
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:19,599
are actually using cannabis and

939
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,460
participating the study that'd be a

940
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:28,180
great use of these devices moreso than

941
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:31,619
looking for intoxication but alright is

942
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:34,730
that it okay thank you so much

943
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,730
