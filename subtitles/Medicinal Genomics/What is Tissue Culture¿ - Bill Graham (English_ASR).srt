2
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,278
let's talk about tissue culture and I

3
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:20,719
know this is a a propagation method that

4
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:23,879
you've been evangelizing for for quite

5
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,399
some time and with the emergence of hopl

6
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,198
and vroid and other plant pathogens it

7
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,159
seems like now more than ever tissue

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,960
culture is top of mine for many Growers

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,960
so so let's dive into it um and let's

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,160
talk about what tissue culture is and

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,759
what advantages that it may have over

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,439
the cloning that a lot of Growers are

13
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:47,558
doing now so um so let's start with that

14
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:50,558
so give us a high level view of what is

15
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:53,959
the tissue culture process and uh we'll

16
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:56,159
take it from there oh happy to uh

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,320
ordinarily tissue culture is going to be

18
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,358
practiced in uh in four stages uh and

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,239
then incidentally I might just take this

20
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,320
opportunity to kind of tell everybody

21
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,880
what tissue culture is in especially as

22
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:13,039
it pertains to plants and very simply it

23
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,039
is Hydroponics with sugar so we're using

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,320
the same nutrients we've got some uh

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,439
special amino acids uh usually there may

26
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,559
be um hormones to give it Direction uh

27
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,199
but uh what makes tissue culture special

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,478
from the Hydroponics that Growers are

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,040
already doing is going to be adding

30
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,920
sugar uh to give that energy source

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,560
directly to the plant sugar can be

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,240
directly absorbed by the stem and uh and

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,320
and surface tissues without roots um to

34
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,438
provide that energy so we can make

35
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,718
plants from pieces that would be too

36
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:47,718
small to uh clone very fast themselves

37
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:49,718
however because it's sugar everything

38
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:52,599
else wants to grow on it and that's when

39
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:54,319
you start seeing the scalpel and forceps

40
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,158
and the HEPA filter and the laminar

41
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,839
hoods and the pressure cookers all those

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,680
things are to be able to make the

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,640
growing medium clean the plant hand it

44
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,439
uh and grow it so that uh the fungus and

45
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,038
bacteria and those things don't get back

46
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:12,359
onto it um but uh given that uh tissue

47
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:16,878
culture is fantastic for being able to

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,080
make lots of uh brand new clones from a

49
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,840
a sterile uh Source once the plant's

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,360
clean and it's growing in um it's

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,560
growing in the jar so the four usual

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,200
steps of of tissue culture are going to

53
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,360
be uh introduction multiplication uh

54
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:35,518
rooting in culture and then rooting back

55
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,280
out of culture but you uh you probably

56
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,239
already know that I've kind of made a

57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,039
little special version of that uh to

58
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
make it easier for for Growers and to

59
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,519
make it more effective for uh a lot of

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,479
our producers right so at a completely

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,239
high level what we're talking about is

62
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:55,079
using small pieces of an established

63
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,158
plant to make new copies of a plant so

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,239
not too dissimilar from what you would

65
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:01,919
do with cloning just with much smaller

66
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,560
pieces right oh yeah yeah and in fact

67
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,079
it's funny I'm actually calling it

68
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,199
tissue cloning because we're using

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,120
tissue culture to clone uh and um and

70
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,839
that's kind of part of my uh the

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,519
shortcut that I've made up and that is

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,759
to um uh top veg plants uh taking a two

73
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,280
or three centimeter uh cutting off of

74
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,919
the top so that the plants will branch

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,199
which is valuable for indoor growth

76
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,598
especially um and this is primarily for

77
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,919
our our vertical Growers but works for

78
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:33,280
anybody who uh is Raising plants uh

79
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,359
indoors and vegetative growth but that's

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,360
uh but that's putting a uh a tip cutting

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,959
directly on to rooting medium which is

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,360
sort of a a shortcut of the usual uh

83
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,360
four stage

84
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
dis

85
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:56,080
[Music]

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,120
