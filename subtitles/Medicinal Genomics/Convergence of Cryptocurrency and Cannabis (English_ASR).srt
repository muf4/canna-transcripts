00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,330
I'm Rob big Leone I'm co-founder of

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,308
horizon formulas em cash and I'm gonna

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,589
talk about cryptocurrencies and

5
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,839
blockchain technology in general at Ken

6
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:20,519
Med conference and there's a few really

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,829
important themes that I want to go over

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,629
one is on the payment side and how

9
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,909
applicable equipt of currency payments

10
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,839
are to the medical marijuana industry

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,159
for a variety of reasons one being that

12
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,109
regulations and access to banking

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,299
services do vary quite significantly

14
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,429
across different states on different

15
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,779
parts of the world so having a kind of a

16
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,128
unifying payment system why

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,230
cryptocurrencies I think it's very

18
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,238
useful for the industry and the second

19
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,578
big aspect is blockchain technology

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,589
lends itself very well to as an

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,448
entrepreneurial platform a framework

22
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,489
upon which businesses can now start

23
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:54,479
leveraging the technology and making

24
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,519
services

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,679
you know easier for their users so I'm

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,020
going to talk about these two general

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,729
strands and one big unifying element to

28
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,650
all of this stuff is the commonality of

29
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,959
philosophy I think between the the

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,320
Bitcoin world and the original movement

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,969
where we are resigned and horizon and

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,769
where the medical marijuana industry is

33
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,868
is it there's a kind of a fundamental

34
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,390
belief and the right to privacy and

35
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,739
personal choice so these are really big

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,000
themes that I think linked the

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,539
industries together so I'm really happy

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,560
to talk to the conference

39
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:32,618
[Music]

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,618
