1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,040
hello my name is TJ Martin today I'm

2
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,160
going be talking to you guys about the

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,960
chemical origins of fruity and savory

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,960
exotic cannabis

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,519
Aromas and

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,960
so so why are we looking into this and

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,358
why should we all care about why

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,199
cannabis smells and tastes the way it

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,760
does well a lot of what when consumers

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,320
are going to a dispensary and they're

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,920
making their purchasing decisions a lot

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,480
of it may be based on te HC content it's

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,039
obviously a very well-known quantity in

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,759
the industry bag appeal especially when

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,519
you're thinking about things like how

16
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,079
the flower butt itself looks or when

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,800
you're looking at concentrates what's

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,239
the color of the concentrate and the

19
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,198
consistency but another thing to

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,280
consider is also how does it smell and

21
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,878
taste right when a consumer takes this

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,840
product home they are going to smoke or

23
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:54,399
and consume it um they they have some

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,680
predisposition or some thought about

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,719
what it's going to Smart taste like when

26
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,920
they bring it home and if it's something

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,840
they enjoy it's going to be something

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,000
that may um Drive these decisions for

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,640
why they decide to repurchase said

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,799
products and the r of cannabus has this

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,719
broad range right it can range anything

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,118
from gassy and sweet Woody and citrus

33
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,400
spicy

34
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:21,438
creamy even things such as grape

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,359
tropical gassy Citrus skunky chemical or

36
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,319
even more more nuanced things like

37
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,319
papayas and

38
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,400
pineapples and so what is some of the

39
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:33,719
chemistry that we know right now a lot

40
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,680
of it this a sanky diagram what a sanky

41
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,959
diagram does it breaks down the

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,560
metabolites of Interest into how they

43
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,959
are based on weight and so this is these

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,280
are proportional to the weight that's

45
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,559
inside the actual cannabis flower

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,960
material obviously canab noids take up a

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,759
large portion of it specifically thca

48
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:55,158
because what I'm looking at today is um

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,840
THC high THC cannabis but then also

50
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,840
breaks down into other things like other

51
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,399
class which would be flavonoids fats

52
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,560
waxes

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,079
um and Aroma compounds and Aroma

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,439
compounds you break down into things

55
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,959
like tpin or flavorant tpin are a subass

56
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,159
of flavorant but for the purposes of

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,520
this I will keep them separate and

58
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,400
flavorants break down into Esters

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,439
alcohols alahh can of sufur compounds

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,159
and these are some of the lowest weight

61
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,598
com um weight content materials in the

62
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,039
plant but they may have some of the

63
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:30,479
highest odor impacts to the actual

64
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,479
material itself

65
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,360
and so the AR

66
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,759
Aroma aromatic categorization of

67
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,280
cannabis as we know it today obviously

68
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,959
have prototypical that's your

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,158
traditional OG kushes things like

70
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,800
wedding cake Gorilla Glue are very spicy

71
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:47,079
herbal and gassy as well as Jack herror

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,719
and hazes that have some Citrus notes

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,000
them very piny very terpenic but when

74
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,359
you start thinking outside of the

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,280
classical range you think of things

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,159
about like sweet Exotics and savory

77
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,840
Exotics so when we started this we

78
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,199
really wanted to understand what makes

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,200
Mak sweet exotic cannabis smell and

80
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,399
taste the way it does obviously we know

81
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,839
a lot about tpin tpin are in the plant

82
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,360
have been studied heavily but what are

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,719
the correlations in the plant that lead

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,720
to make a strain like zittles have some

85
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:17,158
of its unique candy notes so more exotic

86
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,039
Berry cannabis like blue icy blackberry

87
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:22,280
kush have their dark berry notes and as

88
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,878
we're going through this we running some

89
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,959
um more sensory panels internally and

90
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,878
ask giving people free questionnaires

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,319
like hey can you please describe this

92
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,280
cannabis hiid as liberal of terms as you

93
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,399
can be open and honest about it we were

94
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,479
originally starting to look at just how

95
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,560
does sweet differentiate from

96
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,119
prototypical and we were using actually

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,640
garlic cookies as a control and one of

98
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,280
our panelists we asked them like hey is

99
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,639
this would you consider this a exotic or

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,039
not they said well it's not a sweet

101
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,199
exotic but in the context of is it

102
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,598
prototypical no not really either right

103
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,639
it's more of a Savory exotic and so as

104
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,039
we started going through this we're

105
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,158
wondering like hey is there chemistry

106
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,000
behind this that explains how there's

107
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,679
also SA exotic and cannabis and as you

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,680
start seeing the trends in the industry

109
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,879
today we're seeing things like Donnie

110
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,439
burger and pot roast coming in more

111
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,878
popularity the meat breath strains right

112
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,719
obviously funny name right but that's

113
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,438
just how the industry goes but these are

114
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,798
new more Nuance strains that are

115
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,279
definitely not sweet but they're also

116
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,879
not prototypical either so there's got

117
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,518
to be some chemistry there that can

118
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,519
explain those

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,759
differences and so we started everything

120
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,159
from specifically rosin in this study

121
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,759
the reason we used cin was it allows us

122
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,680
to get more a higher concentration of

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,680
the volatile flavorant than flour flour

124
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,600
has a range of half% to 3 or 4%

125
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,079
depending on the specific Cult of our of

126
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,720
choice whereas rosin can from 5 to 15%

127
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,800
depending on the C of our and how it's

128
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,000
extracted it also allows us to get a

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,400
homogeneous sample going onto our GC

130
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,439
when someone makes rosin they're using

131
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,239
multiple plants that are going through

132
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,879
its extraction process if you take just

133
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,759
a singular flower Bud you're pulling it

134
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,839
from Just just one plant depending on

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,439
where you pull it from the plant may

136
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,959
have different impacts on the aroma this

137
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,560
allows us to get a homogeneous sample

138
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,680
also has minimal processing we're not

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,160
worried about solvent carryover solvent

140
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,680
contributions to anything it just

141
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,960
strictly allows us to get what is truest

142
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,439
to the sample with as minimal processing

143
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,439
and most hity

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,478
possible and so some of the data that

145
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,679
came through our initial sensory panels

146
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:29,758
we running through this um we have on

147
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,560
top our four most sweet varieties and on

148
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,240
bottom are for most Savory varieties as

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,319
you can see on what we have here are

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,478
density plots this allows us to

151
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,080
demonstrate how much some of these terms

152
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,560
were used to describe these strains so

153
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:47,318
things like grape pie doido had a lot of

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,800
sweet fruity dark berry notes claimed

155
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,600
and things like papaya Peach and

156
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,478
Juiceman had a lot of sweet fruity as

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,879
well some tropical and citrus notes

158
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,279
being claimed but not very many Savory

159
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,680
notes um whereas the Savory varieties

160
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,439
had a lot of these savory acious

161
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,759
sulfuric chemical notes coming up and

162
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,399
the reason we did this is with the study

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,680
we really wanted to correlate Trends and

164
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,879
sensory data to actual hard chemical

165
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,759
data on the samples that we were

166
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,120
measuring and see if we can start to

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,639
find certain compounds that are highly

168
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,759
responsible for why these strains smell

169
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,038
and taste the way they do if you look

170
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,319
something you'll notice as well is that

171
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:26,120
all these all have the prototypical AR

172
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,800
of cannabis always noted Within These

173
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,639
strains there's slight variations from

174
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,319
cultivar to cultivar but is always there

175
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,478
which is really important to

176
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,120
note and one of the first things we need

177
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:41,279
to know is is this is any the Exotic

178
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,360
Aroma due to specifically the uh the

179
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,198
main turbines that are present the major

180
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
weight

181
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,720
compounds and so we plot here on the

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,759
left in figure a is we have exotic score

183
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,639
from 0 to 100 how was ranked by the

184
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,199
panel as well as where that ranked in

185
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,319
relation to one another and as you look

186
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
through the plot there is no real Trend

187
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,360
but between any of the major turbines

188
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
it's kind of all over the board same

189
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,080
thing on the right when we try and trend

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
is it is there any specific Trends with

191
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,839
the total number of Aroma classifiers in

192
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,159
the context of sweet exotic there was

193
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,359
when it gets more of a sweet exotic it

194
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,960
gets a lot to the consumers it's more

195
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,038
nuanced it gets more difficult to

196
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,959
explain so you get a lot more

197
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,639
descriptors versus savoring prototypical

198
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,638
there's not as much

199
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,199
correlation so we went ahead and looked

200
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,478
at what however all these correlated to

201
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,800
one another so we have here is a

202
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:36,199
correlation Matrix um and from

203
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,478
decreasing exotic score from the top to

204
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,800
the bottom and what this plot allows us

205
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,680
to do is compare each cultivar to one

206
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,520
another from all their sensory

207
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,120
descriptors and say hey how are these

208
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,719
similar or not are there any

209
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,158
relationships between each cultivars and

210
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,840
so the lighter the color the more

211
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:54,839
similar they are the darker the color

212
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,519
the less similar they are and we noce

213
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,478
there was a huge diversity here which

214
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,799
was great that's what we wanted we

215
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,279
wanted a lot of diversity because that

216
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,360
allows us to start looking to the

217
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,839
chemistry find Trends and start to

218
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,639
understand more about this complex field

219
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,839
of cannabis science um something was

220
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,079
interesting we saw Gorilla Glue was this

221
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,439
specific sample was very similar to

222
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,959
garlic cocktail number 7 I'll come back

223
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,439
to that a little bit later but it's

224
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,680
important to note that these should not

225
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,759
really have much similarity to be

226
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,120
honest so now we have our sensory data

227
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,680
now we can go in and start actually

228
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,598
doing some of the hard chemistry what

229
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,440
we're doing is we're using uh GC cross

230
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,918
GC with a Toof Mass Spec detector and an

231
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,000
FID GC cross GC is a type of

232
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,838
two-dimensional gas chromatography what

233
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,599
that means is allows us to employ a

234
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,599
traditional gas chromatograph where you

235
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,800
separate based on compound size but then

236
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,519
at the end it has a pulse flow modulator

237
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,000
which allows you to then separate on a

238
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,000
second column in that same GC but then

239
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,759
bipolarity so you can get a greater

240
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,759
degree of separation and you can see

241
00:08:53,759 --> 00:09:00,000
more of what's in these samples than

242
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,000
what you'd originally have access to

243
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,560
and as we are going through this we used

244
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,679
we built out a custom standard for all

245
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,278
of our quantitation worked with

246
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,439
different standards companies to get as

247
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:15,159
many compounds as commercially available

248
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,120
in an actual calibration standard so

249
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:19,439
these can based on calibrated values and

250
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,320
really try and find these Trends we're

251
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,959
also using direct injection over headp

252
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,879
space this allows us to get as accurate

253
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,359
reproducible data as possible and get

254
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:30,000
more mass on column and see more of

255
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,159
those low analytes because a lot of

256
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,759
these like I showed in the sinki diagram

257
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,120
are very low weight amounts so you have

258
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,439
a high chance that you may not be able

259
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,720
to see it if you don't get enough

260
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,720
material on the GC

261
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:45,000
itself and this is the data we got we

262
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,360
ran through all 30 samples ranking from

263
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,958
Super Savory to classical to Exotic and

264
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,039
everything pretty much looks the same

265
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,559
when you look at a top down view of it

266
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,919
because what you see on the GC is a lot

267
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,799
of the major compounds which don't

268
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:02,759
differentiate that much between cultiv

269
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:05,559
tic cultiv are and so unfor when you

270
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:08,879
look at it it's like here we have great

271
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:11,319
py doido are most fruity exotic and GMO

272
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,838
are most Savory and the chromatograms

273
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,839
look almost identical the set the monot

274
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,760
turpine region looks very similar the

275
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,720
sasat turpine later region looks almost

276
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,200
identical so I'm going to dive deeper

277
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,959
into this so what we know aromatically

278
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,200
from sensory these are different they

279
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:28,399
smell different they taste different but

280
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
the GC data looks very similar so it

281
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,919
means there must be some minor compounds

282
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,920
that are heavily contributing to these

283
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,319
differences and so went back to our

284
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,120
correlation matrices but instead of

285
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,920
looking at actually just the sensory

286
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,839
differentiation now let's actually do it

287
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,639
on all analytes so here on the left we

288
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,800
have all analytes detected for the

289
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,320
samples we put it into a correlation

290
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,039
Matrix again based this is based on how

291
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,560
light it is is how similar they are how

292
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,679
dark it is how different each strain is

293
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,278
to one another and you can see some

294
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,319
differences

295
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:05,600
but not a ton to be honest other than

296
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,959
bubble gum Zid um Gorilla Glue and train

297
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
wreck train wre obviously is a high

298
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,919
tpine based strain which is one of the

299
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,320
few turpening based rosins we actually

300
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,639
find in Southern California for this

301
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,680
study so that one is going to be

302
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,839
different but if you go down and now

303
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,199
break it down and Well's look at just

304
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,440
compare just monot Turpin and

305
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,120
monoterpenoids it looks pretty similar

306
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
you don't see a lot of heavy differences

307
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,039
again showing that monot Turpin

308
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,000
monoterpenoids while important to canab

309
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,360
aren't the differentiating factor in

310
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,200
these exotic Aromas and if you go

311
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,759
further and look at sespan and

312
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,000
sesquiterpenoids they look almost

313
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,759
identical like these are all

314
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,559
09599 or even 10 similarities meaning

315
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,879
it's they're 95 99%

316
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,719
similar now if you take it a bit further

317
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,320
and go just the flavor and remove

318
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,680
everything else out move all the

319
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,519
turbines monps cesco turps out you see

320
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,239
huge differences this is where you start

321
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,039
seeing a lot of the variation but

322
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,919
between these cultivars and that plot

323
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,399
now looks a lot more like our sensory um

324
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,399
correlation

325
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,959
matrices and we started looking and data

326
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,439
we found is a whole bunch of different

327
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,518
flavorings and these are some of the key

328
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,120
ones we wanted to call out because they

329
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,600
are really important to these various

330
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,399
Aromas so and some of these are these

331
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,839
are all well-known compounds by and

332
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,679
large in the traditional flavor

333
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,560
chemistry realm but not necessarily in

334
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,399
the context of cannabis and what it does

335
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,599
in cannabis flavors and Aromas and so on

336
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,639
like the flu fruity side fruity floor

337
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,360
you have things like methyl anthranilate

338
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,480
really common like concord grape purple

339
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,680
grape soda

340
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,240
flavor um some of the really interesting

341
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,239
ones are the creamy sweet compounds

342
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,519
these like six AML Alpha pyone and some

343
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,959
these are compounds in that around that

344
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,360
of purple these are very much your stone

345
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,838
fruit coconut flavors chemical napil

346
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,240
these are heterocycles we've never

347
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,839
really seen nitrogen heterocycles in

348
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,399
cannabis nor we think about flavoring

349
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,480
we're thinking of carbon oxygen POS

350
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,639
sulfur these are super interesting to

351
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:08,399
see um tropical Citrus is a new class of

352
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,560
tropical sulfur compounds in cannabis

353
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,600
that they've been found other places but

354
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,759
these are driving some of these unique

355
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,480
flavor notes that are in tangu strains

356
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:19,399
these weird Citrus notes you don't get

357
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,680
anywhere else um fusil Suite these are

358
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:25,919
seates these are when you're thinking of

359
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,838
think of strains like Zid um runts

360
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,078
gelados really heavily in zittles to be

361
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,760
honest these comp compounds give it that

362
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,399
what makes zittles unique and different

363
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,879
from other Exotics that are even Berry

364
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,078
notes is these CIO compounds and in the

365
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:42,519
fruy suite these ethylate ethy isov

366
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:44,879
valorate really important EST uh very

367
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:48,240
sharp top note that helps again push

368
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,240
this Aroma for

369
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,560
cannabis and so when you think about

370
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,839
Savory Exotics why does SA EXA why do

371
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,919
these GMOs these garlic cookies have

372
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,279
this unique scent to them

373
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,399
and so we found we were looking

374
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,600
comparing our sensory data to our GC

375
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,320
data we notice as there are some key

376
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,480
non-turing compounds that correlate with

377
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,639
this intensely Savory Aroma and these

378
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,159
was indol and Scat scat is found in

379
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,240
human feces and malean feces it gives

380
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,919
poop it smell um and has a wider range

381
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,159
of aromatic impact it's used heavily in

382
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,639
the fragrance industry as well because

383
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,078
depending on the dose rate you use it it

384
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,720
can impact things from we know savory

385
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:34,159
Bary and cannabis all the way to just

386
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,000
chemical napthol like moth ball scent

387
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,360
and very pretty offputting to be honest

388
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,559
but if what's interesting if you look at

389
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,440
chemical structure it's actually very

390
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,439
similar to what you see in melatonin and

391
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,120
this is again indol and Scat all pretty

392
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,920
ubiquitous in nature is interesting to

393
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,519
see in

394
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:53,679
cannabis but to highlight just how

395
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,560
difficult it is to actually see these

396
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,479
this is just um we're looking here is

397
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,758
GMO rosin which is some of the richest

398
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,399
in these compounds we've measured

399
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,839
on the top plot there you have a linear

400
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,480
scale I've highlighted in the box with

401
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,160
the red circles you can't see them now

402
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,440
if you put on a log scale and start

403
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,559
really blowing it up you can see it a

404
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,639
little bit you really have to zoom into

405
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,958
the region and see that there's these

406
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,120
tiny little Peaks that are really buried

407
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,078
in the chromatogram and if this was on a

408
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,759
one onedimensional GC it would have been

409
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,278
incredibly tough to find this unless you

410
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,519
already knew they were there and built a

411
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:29,278
method for detecting it and so these

412
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,959
were again kudos to the scci to an

413
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,240
chemist working on this Dr Ian Oswalt

414
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:36,399
for finding these really buried in there

415
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,159
but these are so important to why GMO

416
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,879
chem dog these various strains smell and

417
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,879
taste the way they

418
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:48,879
do and just another interesting piece

419
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:53,278
about these scat is very similar to 33

420
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:55,120
diol methane it's a CB2 receptor Agonist

421
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,278
that specific compound has promising

422
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,679
anti-cancer properties for certain cell

423
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:04,278
lines it also is found in various um

424
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:08,278
vegetables B what that compound is it is

425
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:10,919
two scats um bonded together so maybe

426
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,278
scat has some impacts for different

427
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:16,120
aspects of cannabis whether it's the

428
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:16,120
mood effects or medicinal

429
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:22,039
properties then getting more into now

430
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,880
the tropical vscs these other compounds

431
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,679
that are being when we looked in our

432
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:29,399
data correlated heavily with wio these

433
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,159
tropical and petroleum citrus strains

434
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,519
smell so unique and different from other

435
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,799
strains we notice is there is three

436
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,759
mercapto hexanol three mercapto hexol

437
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,479
acetate and three mapto hexal

438
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,919
beate um interestingly enough this is

439
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,639
the Gorilla Glue I mentioned earlier had

440
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:47,039
similarities with garlic cocktail number

441
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:49,759
seven garlic cocktail is a very

442
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,799
petroleum Citrus tropical strain Gorilla

443
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,159
Glue is not Gorilla Glue actually when I

444
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,159
went and procured the sample for the

445
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,639
study we win got it as a control for our

446
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,278
sensory panel to use because Gorilla

447
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,600
Glue should be very spicy herbal some

448
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,240
gassiness earthiness and we brought it

449
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,038
in I remember opening it in our sensory

450
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,720
panel and I smelt it I was going to R do

451
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,838
sensory and just knew on the spot like

452
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,360
this was not a real gorilla glue Gorilla

453
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:13,720
Glue does not smell tropical and this

454
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,639
isn't just was kind of sucked for the

455
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,078
study because we're hoping to have a

456
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,880
nice control but it's also a positive as

457
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,438
well right this is a good use case that

458
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,839
can show how you can use the chemistry

459
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,959
of cannabis to start

460
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,918
um authenticating our certain strains

461
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,400
the ones that we say they are right

462
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,360
industry is well known to have renames

463
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,759
people borrowing genetics from one

464
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,839
another things can be Lost in

465
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,480
Translation over the years but the

466
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,319
chemistry doesn't change if the strain

467
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,200
is cier is what it is and this shows

468
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,279
very heavily so this Gorilla Glue is not

469
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,319
a gorilla glue it's very much a Tangi

470
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:50,319
type because glue would not have

471
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:55,759
these and here are the these are some of

472
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,840
the SES we identified in like I said

473
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,480
some of the zidle strains these are a

474
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,359
new class of flavor compounds in

475
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,159
cannabis they have Aromas arranged from

476
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:07,240
fruity banana pear green apple the very

477
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,280
top note heavy some of these don't exist

478
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,919
in other fruits some do um these are

479
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,678
also not commercially available so we

480
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,480
had to go in the lab and synthetically

481
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,640
create purify and isolate all these and

482
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,880
then put these through our sensory panel

483
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,440
um to see what do they smell like right

484
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,799
because I can't just go buy this online

485
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,320
and bring it in and taste it so we can

486
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:28,079
only smell it what is their aromatic

487
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,879
contributions and this is really what

488
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,038
helps different andate Zid differently

489
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,120
from other exotic

490
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,400
cultivars it's also important to note

491
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,199
that this is not present at all in ogs

492
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,600
and other mildly Exotics and not these

493
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,080
really intensely sweet fruity ones it's

494
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,079
just not

495
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:52,599
there I want to see is like just Aroma

496
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,639
percent and some of these specific um

497
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:57,519
major class of compounds do they dictate

498
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,480
Aroma quality so we know they don't push

499
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,879
the the exotic notes of these and we're

500
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,919
not it's not correlated to the

501
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,559
exoticness of cannabis samples but does

502
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,440
it relate to the aromatic quality of the

503
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,839
sensory panel so relating the aromatic

504
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,000
fraction weight and the Exotic score and

505
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,240
you don't see again with these major

506
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,519
tpin again no correlation flavorant you

507
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,960
have this huge correlation monoterpenes

508
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,158
monoterpenoids basically Flatline cesit

509
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,200
turpine catenoids actually

510
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,400
decreases um kind of makes sense CES

511
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,159
turpine sidoides are associated with

512
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,360
older age cannabis typically because

513
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,640
these are some of the things that flash

514
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,798
off the last and they volatize the

515
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,559
slowest rate so there may be some

516
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:41,558
negative connotation there for some

517
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,359
panelists and now looking to maybe

518
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,080
there's maybe it's just not just monot

519
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,798
maybe there's a specific monot turpine

520
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:57,119
that does Drive some of these aromatic

521
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:59,558
exotic Aromas and the perceived exotic

522
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,279
Aromas and so you looked at them all and

523
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:03,678
really there was none they were all

524
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,839
pretty much flat lines for the most part

525
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,679
um indicating that again while these

526
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,599
major monot Turpin are important in the

527
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,400
context of cannabis they don't

528
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:14,558
differentiate the Exotic nature of these

529
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,720
various

530
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,480
cultivars so when to look in the bottom

531
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,000
is like well maybe it's related to

532
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,480
flavorant maybe it's related to the

533
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,480
tropical vs in the middle or even the um

534
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,960
heterocycles like indol and Scat on the

535
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,759
bottom right and we noticed is that it

536
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,798
is that's what those heat plots are

537
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,679
showing is that as things be as they get

538
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,519
a higher concentration we start seeing

539
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,960
more of these compounds it does Trend

540
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,400
with these compounds which makes sense

541
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,279
as we were comparing the sensory data to

542
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,840
the GC data we expected these written

543
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,839
this just further confirms that

544
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,319
notion and so with this now we've been

545
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,039
able to expand our understanding is of

546
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,519
the Exotic cannabis Aroma spectrum and

547
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:59,119
able to start flushing out what is sweet

548
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,119
uh exotic cannabis what are the

549
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,000
compounds responsible as fruity Berry

550
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:06,158
tropical unique Citrus notes as well as

551
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,480
on the Savory side what's responsible

552
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,919
for those onion garlic chemical notes

553
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,919
and get a broader more in-depth

554
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,440
understanding of why exotic cannabis

555
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,440
smells and tastes the way it

556
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,840
does and so some of the conclusions here

557
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,440
um we notice Turpin minimally if at all

558
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:25,639
influence the perceived exotic nature of

559
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,880
cannabis the small concentration

560
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,480
compounds your flavorant are really

561
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,240
combining to heavily impact the unique

562
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,038
attributes scat is one one of the major

563
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,880
components with indol impacting that

564
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,839
chem Funk sewer unique node these acious

565
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,799
not not only acious but it gets

566
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,359
perceived as such in these exotic Savory

567
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:46,720
straints and then the tropical VC's

568
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,918
really impact those unique Tangy Citrus

569
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,079
notes some the future work we're looking

570
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:54,400
into is looking at PCA and another

571
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:56,038
statistical classification analyses uh

572
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,038
different formulating algorithms to

573
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:59,119
accurately predict some of these

574
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,919
aromatic properties can you Rel

575
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,798
these into more digestal metrics for

576
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,278
consumers um obviously you're very

577
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:07,319
sensitive and understand that this is

578
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:09,079
very hard chemistry a very complex

579
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,278
compound names it doesn't really mean

580
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,879
much to an end consumer butting you have

581
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,558
three more cap to hex elocate on a

582
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,080
container at a high level means nothing

583
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,319
to them if anything it's probably scary

584
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:20,879
right but these are meaningful impacts

585
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,359
to chemistry there's probably a way we

586
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,679
can use this in a meaningful way to

587
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,959
educate consumers in maybe various

588
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,080
ranking scores and systems right or

589
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,278
other there's got to be another way to

590
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,399
educate consumers and at least help them

591
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:37,440
move away from just THC and realize

592
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,120
there is other things that play driving

593
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,798
these experiences that they so much love

594
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:45,599
and enjoy and then lastly structural

595
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:47,119
solution of other unknowns there's lots

596
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,678
of other unknowns in these cannabis

597
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,079
cultivars that we have and solved

598
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,600
cannabis produces tons and tons of

599
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:56,240
compounds we publishing on these as we

600
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,119
find these we understand the unique

601
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,240
chemistry that relates to the aromatic

602
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,639
proper and what these relationships are

603
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,880
but there's still a lot more out there

604
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
and just one other thing I would like to

605
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,960
mention on this whole thing is that this

606
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,639
can be often times like perceived as

607
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,480
tpin are Irrelevant in cannabis which is

608
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,840
not true right when this study was

609
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,720
originally published we saw a lot of

610
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:18,678
Articles out there take this and put in

611
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,798
the context of turpins are irrelevant

612
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,200
they're not irrelevant actually if you

613
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,359
because when we did this and we created

614
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,640
a lot of our different products we

615
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,599
stripped out all the tpin and made

616
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,559
blends with just the flavorants just all

617
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,879
the fruity flavoring the chemot the THS

618
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,158
everything except for the tpin and it

619
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,440
has no semblance of cannabis doesn't

620
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,159
smell terrible but doesn't smell like

621
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,640
cannabis at all because tpin are the

622
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,720
foundational piece to why it smells and

623
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,400
tastes the way it does it helps bridge

624
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,240
and marry everything together it's the

625
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,278
right ratios everything that can give

626
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,038
you that Symphony that is each each

627
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:53,839
cannabis

628
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:56,640
Aroma that with that i' like to

629
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,959
acknowledge the team huge thanks to Dr

630
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,559
Ian Oswald heavily LED this study and

631
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,319
found a lot of why these things smell

632
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:05,200
and taste the way they do with me um

633
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,558
twinkle and Manny Marcos did a lot of

634
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,240
the lab work a lot of the data analysis

635
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:13,079
with us man he did all the synthesis of

636
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,679
the seu weights um Kevin our CSO for

637
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,759
always helping support and helping drive

638
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,840
this research

639
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,440
forward huge shout out to 710 Labs great

640
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,759
collaborator of ours they provided a lot

641
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,120
of high-end fresh rosin that soon as it

642
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:28,599
was done that way we could have ideal

643
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:30,319
samples um something isn't lost on us is

644
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,000
that the fresher the sample the better

645
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:35,038
the data so you want as fresh as you can

646
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,398
possible cuz then the GC can only detect

647
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,200
so much and then shout out to rest of

648
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:41,079
the entire abstract team step solve

649
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,840
analytical marks International for all

650
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:46,000
the help and collaboration over the

651
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,000
years with that I'll take

652
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,000
questions the um shelf life and delicacy

653
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:06,720
of some of these U things you're finding

654
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,159
um these Esters um I I've noticed from

655
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,319
cultivation you pull down the stuff um

656
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,360
it's great through trim you package it

657
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,398
and you start to lose a lot of these

658
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,519
Esters incredibly quickly have you

659
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:22,239
looked at at the delicacy of any of

660
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:26,000
these compounds responsible for some of

661
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,159
these fruity sweet notes so not not

662
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,398
specifically to these sweet notes over

663
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,278
time time um in our first publication we

664
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:35,199
did look at sulfur compounds and how

665
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,599
they age one how it forms throughout the

666
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,919
growth cycle where it forms during cure

667
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,038
and then how it lasts throughout

668
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,759
packaging we saw with P merap which is

669
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,359
responsible for the gas here that that

670
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:49,839
really starts peeking around right is

671
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:52,599
your finishing cure but then a week or a

672
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,759
week week and a half after packaging

673
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:55,959
depending on your packaging scenario you

674
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,679
can lose 50% of those Aral compounds by

675
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,880
weight so packaging plays a huge role on

676
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,519
why these things are either retained and

677
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,159
delivered to the end consumer or lost

678
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,440
right and so also this is just goes to

679
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,480
highlight how important curing is

680
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,960
storage properly treating the plant

681
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,360
because these are delicate compounds

682
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,558
Esters are more volatile not all of them

683
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,079
but a large portion of them like

684
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:22,720
ethylate is as volatile or more volatile

685
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,240
than a lot of monot turbines so if a lot

686
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,640
of these monot turbines are being lost

687
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,000
in the first 30 days start with these

688
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,159
fruity EST nodes but you can help

689
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,480
mitigate that by proper proper packaging

690
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,520
scenarios if you're using a like a mild

691
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,240
like think of your classical sandwich

692
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:42,319
baggies right from the traditional days

693
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,839
Legacy days like it's not helping

694
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,119
protect the material at all it's

695
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,798
probably going to last a couple days

696
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,639
before it's fully dried out and you lose

697
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,319
everything what if you have a really

698
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,120
well built out packaging solution

699
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,398
because you have I mean put a lot of

700
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,798
time an effort in growing and curing

701
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:57,079
that cannabis if you can get in a nice

702
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:00,240
packaging so you can help protect it to

703
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:00,240
that end consumer

704
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:17,000
hey

705
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:18,759
TJ um when we talk about um stability

706
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,359
have you looked at the stability of the

707
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:21,960
various compounds and even worked with

708
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:25,199
some of the manufacturers to look at the

709
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,679
stability from a flavor perspective and

710
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,720
even a talkx

711
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:32,559
perspective so like a flavor perspective

712
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,919
it's tough on flour for sure when you

713
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,639
have extracts one of the benefits are

714
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,679
you have an ideal storage one you have

715
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,799
more by weight so you have more that can

716
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,880
be lost before like percentage wise that

717
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,918
can be lost before it has an specific

718
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,799
aromatic noticeable difference to the

719
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,600
end consumer right and it's also in an

720
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:53,519
ideal Matrix it can be stored in a

721
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,038
fridge or a freezer to help protect

722
00:27:53,519 --> 00:28:00,399
those compounds but have we looked at

723
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:02,519
the toxicology of say a one rosin or one

724
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,000
flower not really we've looked at

725
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,480
specifically compounds of interest and

726
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,679
what those toxical components may be

727
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,919
because obviously we're using abstracts

728
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,919
as obviously a flavor a tpine flavor

729
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,240
house and a cannabis extraction company

730
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,159
so we care to see one what makes it

731
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,558
smell and taste the way it does but how

732
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,399
do we do this in a safe or more

733
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:25,079
acceptable meaningful fashion right and

734
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:26,719
so we're not delivering anything

735
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,079
negative to our customers and then

736
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,120
consumers but as as far as how raws and

737
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:35,158
ages on a shelf not necessarily at least

738
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,158
not in the context of

739
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:49,479
this all right if there no other

740
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:49,480
questions yeah
