influencers and what we really strive to

customer short and sweet guys

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,050
I am Evan Brittain I'm a former NFL

15
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:50,238
player I played six years in the league

16
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:53,718
with the Jaguars and the Bears as an

17
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:56,299
offensive lineman I got into the

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,120
cannabis space and a cannabis advocacy

19
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:00,858
activism if you will you know through my

20
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,259
career I suffered a laundry list of

21
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:06,560
injuries how that's dealt with in the

22
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:09,409
NFL is lots of prescription pills had a

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,930
handful of concussions and through that

24
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,030
cannabis was really my preferred source

25
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,850
of pain management

26
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,150
you know when the pills opiates in

27
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:22,368
particular made me feel insane irritable

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,950
made it difficult to sleep and recover

29
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:28,009
you know I could constantly come back to

30
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,530
cannabis and it was the one thing that

31
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:33,290
helped me recover it helped me heal from

32
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,710
you know long day of grind three hours

33
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,930
of full padded practice smashing into

34
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:42,469
other 300-pound individuals hundreds of

35
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,899
times a day you know that does a lot of

36
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:48,978
damage to your skeletal system to your

37
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:51,829
brain in particular and you know coming

38
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:54,289
out of that experience feeling like I

39
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:57,319
had for the most part my body and my

40
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,290
mind intact you know learning about the

41
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:02,629
neuro protectant antioxidant qualities

42
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:06,259
of cannabinoids in the brain following

43
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:09,319
brain trauma and concussions I do a lot

44
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:12,050
to push the NFL to remove cannabis from

45
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,599
its banned substance list as it looks to

46
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,150
be the number one

47
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,479
remedy to their biggest issue which are

48
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,670
concussions and CTE which is affecting

49
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,909
just about every guy that plays football

50
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:28,759
whether it's from high school to the NFL

51
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:32,840
87 percent of football players tested

52
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:39,829
positive for CTE that's from high school

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:42,409
to the NFL 99.9% of NFL brains tested

54
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,680
positive for CTE in a Boston University

55
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:49,520
study that came out probably about a

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,270
year ago now so I created an

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,490
organization called athletes for care

58
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:58,150
which is a resource and education

59
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:01,430
platform for athletes in their

60
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:04,969
transition out of their careers as pro

61
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,640
athletes as well as you know educating

62
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:09,199
them on the medicinal benefits of

63
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:13,759
cannabis as opposed to prescription

64
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:19,789
pills and so it's great to be here thank

65
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:22,609
you guys for having me so the panel is

66
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:25,879
about to be about medical cannabis but

67
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,990
in the scenario the NFL I always

68
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:29,120
imagined it would be better for the

69
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,920
players to actually be preventative

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,750
medicine right that there should be

71
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,439
probably neuroprotective in their

72
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,419
bloodstream during the game what is this

73
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:41,359
term medical seems very reactionary what

74
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:46,039
are your thoughts on this I think that

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:50,000
you know right now the NFL unfortunately

76
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:52,939
continues to run from their issues I

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,680
think it's funny that you can watch a

78
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:59,349
football game now and they have PSA is

79
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,800
talking about new helmet technology

80
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:05,870
which does nothing as we know they're

81
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,550
talking about coaches are really

82
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,659
concerned about the well-being of their

83
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:15,230
players and you know it's it's [Â __Â ]

84
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:18,048
and frankly you know cannabis is

85
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:20,269
something that you know our federal

86
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,388
government has a patent on cannabinoids

87
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,990
as a neuro protectants an anti

88
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:29,280
students the NFL has a major issue with

89
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,379
concussions these are guys you know CTE

90
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:35,079
the wreckage that it causes is you know

91
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:37,060
you're a 40 year old man and you're

92
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:40,628
already being diagnosed with stage 2

93
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,629
dementia you know I have friends guys

94
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:46,449
who have played in the league who are in

95
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:49,419
you know real dire need of anything to

96
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:52,990
get them out of it and so you know the

97
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:54,549
NFL seems to be very slow to take on

98
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,379
this conversation I think they're

99
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,590
starting to approach it a little bit

100
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,330
other leagues have been more proactive

101
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:03,818
you know really comes down to the owners

102
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:05,709
relationship with the players you know

103
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:08,229
it's since you're a rookie coming into

104
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:10,598
the league it's about protect the shield

105
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:13,149
you know everything you do as a player

106
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:15,579
is about maintaining the integrity of

107
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:18,278
the league rather than putting that

108
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:21,218
before yourself and the NFL owners have

109
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:23,319
a long history of turning their backs on

110
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:26,050
players look at Colin Kaepernick right

111
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:29,468
now they've totally demonized him and

112
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:32,259
ruined his career essentially and power

113
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:33,449
to him for taking them to to court for

114
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,939
it

115
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:42,338
you know so I had conversations with NBA

116
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:44,050
owners who are very you know excited to

117
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:46,418
support their players in any way they

118
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,228
can you know you see with guys like Al

119
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:52,448
Harrington cliff Robinson these guys are

120
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:54,818
really making strides David Stern former

121
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,620
Commissioner of the NBA saying that guys

122
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:58,598
should have access to cannabis you've

123
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,689
got Steve Kerr talking about it with the

124
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:03,550
Warriors you know so they are much more

125
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:06,490
proactive and actually do care about

126
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,918
players well-being you know this isn't

127
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,348
like a boo boo thing for the NFL players

128
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:13,028
you know it's really on the NFL players

129
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:15,519
at this point to make a stand for

130
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:18,278
themselves you know don't go out and

131
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:21,008
play that Thursday night game stay in

132
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:22,778
stay in the locker room until you start

133
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:25,930
getting your demands met because at this

134
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:29,110
point you know the PA is really just a

135
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,870
front for the NFL now it's all funded by

136
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,610
the league and when you walk in there

137
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,090
even me as a former player they don't

138
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,230
care about

139
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:40,750
former players and you know from aside

140
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,819
from that they're not really looking to

141
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,069
go up against the league in anything

142
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,709
that matters you know I think at this

143
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,209
point with everything that's happened

144
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:52,539
all the conversations that have been

145
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:55,029
going on the opiate abuse in the league

146
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,569
NFL players are four times as likely to

147
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:01,719
abuse opioids in the average American

148
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:03,639
and so you know they have a number of

149
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,650
issues that cannabis can solve I think

150
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,189
it'll be a bargaining chip for them on

151
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:11,079
the table coming into this new

152
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:12,910
collective bargaining agreement you know

153
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,430
but what it's going to be is you guys

154
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,800
play two more games maybe will allow you

155
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,870
to use cannabis or at least in the

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,389
states where it's legal you can access

157
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:26,168
it but I think that's still a long

158
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:28,030
stretch for the league at this point are

159
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:30,219
you seeing traction in other sports like

160
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:33,099
an NHL obviously plays across borders

161
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,500
with Canada and is this can we leverage

162
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,570
the other athletic associations to try

163
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,759
and make change for sure I think that

164
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:46,680
you know the NFL will make a change you

165
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:50,259
know the very last minute that they can

166
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,079
you're totally right on the NHL is much

167
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,909
more interested in the cannabis

168
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:58,478
conversation allowing their players to

169
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:01,240
use it a guy that is a co-founder with

170
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:04,538
me at athletes for Kerr Riley Cote has

171
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,769
made some tremendous strides in getting

172
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:10,149
the NHL Players Association to start

173
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:11,799
having these conversations about

174
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,689
cannabis at least for their former

175
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,788
players and then you know who knows

176
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:20,139
maybe you did it removed from the banned

177
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:21,969
substance list but you know the NFL is

178
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,519
in a unique position because they have

179
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:28,150
so much influence you know they could

180
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:30,069
really uh you know I I challenge the NFL

181
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:32,049
over and over again maybe one of these

182
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:35,740
times I say it they'll they'll read it

183
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:39,218
but you know they could really be the

184
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,229
ones spearheading this new era of

185
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:44,000
medicine you know they could be

186
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,400
spearheading this idea that

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,299
these cannabinoids can be used to treat

188
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,389
traumatic brain injuries as well as you

189
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:54,979
know they've got a great opportunity for

190
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:57,319
you know the best case study for

191
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,149
cannabis as a preventive medicine you

192
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:05,210
know in in their players and

193
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:08,419
and every team in the league what's your

194
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:11,330
perspective on this what on which what

195
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:12,799
precisely are you asking you've got a

196
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,879
lab started now you've been making

197
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:19,219
nutrients sure for many years you've

198
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:21,169
here's a deal every one of you who are

199
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,500
sitting here in the audience is an

200
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:27,049
influencer that will positively show

201
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,840
cannabis in the way that it must be

202
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:32,089
showing I am so glad Netflix got rid of

203
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,259
the show disjointed I'm sick of seeing

204
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:38,540
the typical stoner stuff and them making

205
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:42,799
fun of us and laughing at us think about

206
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:45,399
this for the last 40 to 50 years the

207
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:48,319
general public has been indoctrinated

208
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,600
falsely given false information and been

209
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,270
brainwashed and it's gonna take a while

210
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,610
to unravel it it's gonna take all of us

211
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:59,449
in this room whether it's the state

212
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:02,240
level the local level you got to get

213
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,700
busy and start either writing articles

214
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,899
Evan here he's a creative writer he did

215
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,470
something very smart he learned how to

216
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:11,990
write write white papers inform the

217
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,600
public get rid of the stigma and let's

218
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:17,299
enter into the new age of what cannabis

219
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,820
really is about and what it can do for

220
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,679
people I don't care if it's recreational

221
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,879
nutraceutical or pharmaceutical

222
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:25,338
everybody deserves to have great

223
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,639
delivery systems safe and standardized

224
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,980
products and everyone sitting in this

225
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,830
room can have a hand in it if you choose

226
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,839
to and I'm asking you to do it go back

227
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,629
to your your cities where you came from

228
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,020
start writing articles getting on TV

229
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:45,620
anyone who will listen to you and do not

230
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:48,110
allow them to stigmatize cannabis in a

231
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,330
negative way because we don't deserve it

232
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,379
and we've worked too hard and too long

233
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:57,290
and this plant is an amazing plant that

234
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:59,299
has so many properties to heal people

235
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:02,088
so many levels I don't care if you're a

236
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:03,559
recreational user or pharmaceutical user

237
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:05,540
to me you're all patients you're

238
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:10,459
medicating for a reason and we all

239
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:14,259
deserve safe standardized products yes I

240
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:17,899
[Applause]

241
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:19,490
offer you to a discussion I also think

242
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:21,828
the whole recreational medical thing is

243
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,839
is a bit of a misnomer it's like it's

244
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:25,250
some sort of forced dichotomy that

245
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,980
doesn't really exist if you don't have

246
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,778
enough of the former or the recreation

247
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,019
you're gonna find out needing that you

248
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:34,730
need the medical so you obviously yeah

249
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,889
well the same experience how about you

250
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,778
David what's your feeling this well I

251
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,759
mean that's exactly why you know we got

252
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:42,470
into the business and started doing the

253
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,659
in dispensary broadcast network is

254
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,879
because of the stigma I mean being in

255
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:49,730
the NBA we had players that were using

256
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,559
CBDs and and using marijuana you know in

257
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,940
fact that the teams would prefer it

258
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,758
versus them going out and drinking and

259
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,949
getting in trouble so it's to me I had a

260
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,709
like kind of an entourage effect with

261
00:11:57,948 --> 00:12:03,379
you know we had just finished the 2015

262
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:05,929
season things were going good

263
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:07,399
all of a sudden Tommy got rectal cancer

264
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:09,679
and my wife got a brain tumor my dad

265
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,100
passed away from opiates and at that

266
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,138
particular moment I left the team and I

267
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,000
went full bore into cannabis club TV and

268
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:18,919
I agree with with Mike on the sense that

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,809
we you know even though Tommy's our

270
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:23,539
influencer you know he's an amazing

271
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:27,559
activist and you know the campy side of

272
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:29,568
cannabis is not always well received and

273
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,239
it's what it's our biggest weapon used

274
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:34,969
against us and I think for us we try to

275
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,278
really focus on bringing educational

276
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,870
content whether it be how to grow how to

277
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,299
cook with cannabis

278
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,370
you know topics of discussion new

279
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:45,019
financial information you know it's

280
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,938
about the education and to Mike's point

281
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:48,620
like you you know we live in an era

282
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:50,870
where every single one of you guys can

283
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,938
be an influencer and you can help spread

284
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,679
the word and it's really about you know

285
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,179
having that discussion with people

286
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,578
asking them what their point of view on

287
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:00,528
it is a lot of its just fear and I think

288
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:02,208
the the benefit of having the science

289
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:04,399
you know platform and having that

290
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:06,669
relationship with cannabis and learning

291
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,769
words I've never heard before

292
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:10,839
you know is is how we're gonna be able

293
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:13,090
to reach a lot of these patients and so

294
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,740
you know we'd need to make people feel

295
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,149
as comfortable to go that they go buy a

296
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,710
bottle of whiskey that they're able to

297
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:19,779
feel it's just as comfortable to buy the

298
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:23,650
cannabis to treat their nausea for some

299
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,879
reason yeah indeed indeed and we're

300
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,649
seeing that now we're seeing a massive

301
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,049
migration of the alcohol industry into

302
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,340
cannabis and it's my belief that that's

303
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:31,750
gonna echo itself with the

304
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,160
pharmaceutical industry we're gonna see

305
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,419
tylenol go away we're gonna see

306
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,129
ibuprofen go away we're gonna see

307
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:38,379
aspirin go away because we have safer

308
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:40,240
alternatives I mean for those at the tie

309
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:41,679
and all am four or four right this is an

310
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,570
endo can have annoyed my medic that is

311
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,039
made when you deliver digest Tylenol and

312
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,140
it makes a toxic byproduct in the

313
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,319
process that sometimes been attributed

314
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:53,559
to to in utero autism events all types

315
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,360
of other overdose related issues you can

316
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,679
have with your liver but we have all

317
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,659
these cannabinoids now that are gonna

318
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,750
march in and at some point I think farm

319
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:03,159
is gonna stop lobbying and start buying

320
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,539
and investing in these other cannabis

321
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,889
companies and so I think that next wave

322
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:08,579
is coming and what we're seeing right

323
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:11,289
now go on in Canada is just the start

324
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,850
much more to come here's an interesting

325
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:18,399
statistic new patients new medical

326
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,519
marijuana patients who are coming in for

327
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,699
the first time into dispensary are 56

328
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,639
years of age they also spend three times

329
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:31,180
more than the REC recreational client

330
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:34,809
well as well interesting so management's

331
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:36,159
gonna be huge demographics I said at a

332
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:38,109
time I think medical is gonna be bigger

333
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:42,730
than rank I just we haven't recognized

334
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:49,259
it yet hmm yeah on that point big Mike

335
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:54,279
my my wife's family is a very

336
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:57,970
straight-laced or column Pasadena's god

337
00:14:54,279 --> 00:15:02,199
bless him love him today but you know

338
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:04,420
since being on this this path of really

339
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,140
cannabis advocacy just being outspoken

340
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:10,899
about it educating at just about every

341
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:11,889
family function party I go to talking

342
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,309
about do you know we have an

343
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:19,049
endocannabinoid system in our bodies

344
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:21,179
and you know since then I've really you

345
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:22,948
know it's been first my wife's uncle

346
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,120
then her parents you know and they're

347
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:26,068
coming to me and they're like AB you

348
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,009
know I can't sleep

349
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:32,338
only well I got something for you you

350
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:34,769
know and immediately they're they're

351
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,649
converted into believers you know from

352
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:41,459
people who were really affected by the

353
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:44,308
stigma you know growing up in the 60s

354
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,989
and 70s you know having this idea that

355
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:49,679
you know it's the devil's weed there's

356
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:51,659
no place for it in a family setting in a

357
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,638
family atmosphere and they're like wow

358
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,999
this stuff really works you know it

359
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,620
takes me from waking up you know every

360
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,850
couple hours throughout the night not

361
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,889
being able to get a good night's sleep

362
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,189
to waking up feeling refreshed and

363
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:09,058
recovered and I think that you know as

364
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:10,799
it as it comes to influence like Big

365
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:13,740
Mike was talking about you know getting

366
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,748
into just at your local level I mean

367
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,600
your influence you can have a positive

368
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:21,240
influence on this thing you know just

369
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,680
starting at your family functions you

370
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,659
know have a conversation at the dinner

371
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,909
table then you never know you might

372
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,948
affect your gonna change you know one or

373
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:31,919
two minds and then the ripple effect of

374
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:35,128
that and how many people continue out of

375
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,438
that that you positively influence about

376
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:41,480
the power of this plan because the truth

377
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:44,458
is you know it's non-toxic it's a

378
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,370
thousand you know ten thousand year old

379
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:50,008
remedy probably older you know it comes

380
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:53,068
from the earth there are no side effects

381
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:55,438
it's never killed anyone helps you sleep

382
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:58,620
we produce these same chemical compounds

383
00:16:55,438 --> 00:17:02,159
in our body it's amazing you know and

384
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,919
continuing to inform people about these

385
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,288
things I think it really it makes a

386
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,620
difference you make an impact I had a

387
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:12,869
really interesting conversation with dr.

388
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,808
Bonnie Goldstein just just a minute ago

389
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:18,719
about this you know it's it's kind of

390
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:20,158
crazy you know how you can affect you

391
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,380
know even she was telling me about her

392
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:24,179
parents how she's got them using

393
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,528
cannabis dangers

394
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:30,360
so did the ovens point the general I

395
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:33,058
talked to a lot of doctors not in

396
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,199
obviously in in this conference they

397
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:35,970
have no idea that we have an

398
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,639
endocannabinoid system they have no idea

399
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:40,970
we have cb1 cb2 receptors so when you

400
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:43,859
educate things that you take for granted

401
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,569
that well everybody knows that let me

402
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:49,618
tell you the general public has no idea

403
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:54,148
they don't know leaders between cannabis

404
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:59,249
indica sativa or a hybrid so start with

405
00:17:54,148 --> 00:18:00,748
the basics and educate up I think it's a

406
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:02,730
great point because we went through a

407
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:03,538
very similar thing this year with her

408
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,980
father

409
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:07,378
and we were educating folks at

410
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,118
dana-farber right so we get in there and

411
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,949
it's a typical PSA test they do some

412
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:12,658
scans and everything else and the

413
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,038
treatment is kind of a protocol and we

414
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,259
say well hold on let's sequence this

415
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:19,288
thing and we discover he has this

416
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:21,269
mutation that's known as a b-raf k6 o 1e

417
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:23,009
variant okay for those in the cancer

418
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:24,899
space they're really familiar with this

419
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:26,999
variant because there's a neighboring

420
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:28,678
amino acid called v600e that is heavily

421
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:30,538
studied in Roche has drugs that targeted

422
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,600
but nothing for one of me to acid over

423
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:35,278
look crazy right Foundation medicine

424
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,359
then gives you this report that says

425
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:37,528
well these are all the experimental

426
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,769
drugs that might work for it they're in

427
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:43,859
phase 2b trials good luck but you want a

428
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:45,690
KT inhibitors and of course having read

429
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:48,058
about a KT and m2 we're now in cool

430
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,919
cannabinoids or potent a KT inhibitors

431
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:51,359
why aren't we using those bringing all

432
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,629
the papers show them and they're they're

433
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,709
like go for it we support you no

434
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:57,269
problems with that at all here

435
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,909
which I was quite surprised by cuz we

436
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:01,589
had other experiences where when he got

437
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,820
hospitalized due to other other

438
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:04,648
scenarios they would end up in a

439
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,118
hospital that was like you can't have it

440
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:08,638
on premise get out of here

441
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:10,678
they almost threatened to send him the

442
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:13,859
thirty thousand dollar bill for having

443
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,330
used it on-site and so there is there's

444
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:16,769
different education that needs to go on

445
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:18,329
in different hospitals I think the

446
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,829
cancer centers are aware of this they

447
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:22,349
see that people are using this with

448
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:24,048
success for nausea and for pain but many

449
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:26,609
of the other ER doctors that might

450
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:29,668
handle patients getting rushed in due to

451
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:31,378
an adverse event in cancer are oblivious

452
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,179
to it and they're held down to certain

453
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,829
rules and regulations that don't allow

454
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,130
any of this stuff on-site and they're

455
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:37,799
the ones

456
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,370
to get a work on I'm fully convinced

457
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:44,069
that if my dad was able to use a veteran

458
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:45,719
so he was unable to take cannabis if he

459
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:47,819
got tested positive when they did test

460
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,089
for it but they had no problem giving

461
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:53,309
him 900 1/2 milligram pills of or 5

462
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:56,549
milligram pills of oxycontin so and

463
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:57,929
literally killed him I'm certain if we

464
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:01,289
were able to get it and there's a lot of

465
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:04,289
you know businesses that are popping up

466
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:05,879
and going into the the the old folks

467
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:08,279
homes if you will and like talking to

468
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,470
the patient's I mean my 74 year old

469
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:15,029
mother-in-law Japanese very strict no

470
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:17,490
way to smoke weed or cannabis sorry is

471
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,710
now using CBD so it's like in and it

472
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,880
came from actually her doctor referring

473
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,610
it to her like hey this is going to be

474
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,280
the best for you we really got to ask

475
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:27,539
our doctors to to kind of look into that

476
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,609
what's your doctor's position on

477
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,440
cannabis how are they willing to look

478
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:33,419
into that I'm living in Santa Cruz I've

479
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,920
got a beneficial bubble basically

480
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,690
everybody embraces cannabis there but

481
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,539
it's a pretty small bubble when you get

482
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,150
out of it look the United States has to

483
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:44,759
lead the way to educate the world I was

484
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:47,430
just reading today if you're a citizen

485
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,549
of South Korea and you come to medical

486
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,200
marijuana state and you use medical

487
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,940
marijuana that's perfectly legal in that

488
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,090
state it's the same thing as breaking

489
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,570
the law in South Korea and you're liable

490
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:03,959
to get five years in jail in Abu Dhabi

491
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:06,000
if you go there and they take your blood

492
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,759
and they find cannabinoids in your blood

493
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,190
it is exactly the same as possession be

494
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:15,059
careful where you travel but here's the

495
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:17,279
real point United States and Canada must

496
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:20,339
educate the rest of the world and

497
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,410
society because if we are to your point

498
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:23,730
we're living in a bubble here once you

499
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,769
step outside of this bubble it's

500
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,230
extremely different I traveled all over

501
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:31,200
the world and I get in a lot of

502
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,059
conversations about cannabis and a lot

503
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:39,259
of governments are still very negative

504
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:42,119
they don't understand it's it's

505
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:43,650
everywhere this medical journey that we

506
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,289
went through with her father was just i

507
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,580
opening as to how the amount of

508
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:50,279
ignorance that's out there on this

509
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:52,859
and suppression that's going on by the

510
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,779
way all these people who are against it

511
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:58,169
as soon as one of their family members

512
00:21:54,779 --> 00:22:00,119
gets ill and dries cannabis and is

513
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,500
successful with it it changes

514
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,689
immediately

515
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,299
I've seen this so it happens so many

516
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,400
times well right after my wife's surgery

517
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,919
we managed to mitigate pain and nausea

518
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,580
from a full craniotomy you know peach

519
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,289
sized tumor with indicas and CBDs and

520
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:17,819
her neurologist is like you're healing

521
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:19,680
really well you're not refilling your

522
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,089
prescription what are you doing and we

523
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,400
told her and she's from Stanford like

524
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,899
keep doing it you know just keep doing

525
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,160
what you're doing that's what triggered

526
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,560
my mother-in-law and my father-in-law

527
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,009
who's a 25-year master sergeant in the

528
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,730
Marines

529
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:34,710
it just takes somebody you know having

530
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,240
that personal experience to then

531
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,340
transfer out and then they're the

532
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,809
biggest they're like the best advocate

533
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,119
they tell everybody that she's telling

534
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:43,470
all her you know Martin fans like when

535
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:46,049
she goes and plays cards like hey when

536
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:50,460
using CBD I catch it because I hear CBD

537
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:51,720
but the rest is Japanese you know a lot

538
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,390
of times I've been I got a few surgeries

539
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,339
and they always prescribed me these

540
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,110
opiates and I said I'm not gonna take

541
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:01,349
them they go what are you gonna do I'm

542
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:04,379
gonna take CBD and THC and they watch me

543
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:06,179
do it and every one of them when I'm

544
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,640
done with the surgery and of heal that

545
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,140
go tell me more about what I can do and

546
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,900
how can I get some of this to give to my

547
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:18,030
patients every one of them well we had

548
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,759
one other story I'll share which was

549
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,569
I've father had to get a pacemaker put

550
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,920
in throughout this whole cancer

551
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:25,049
treatment because some of the cancer

552
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,880
drugs were triggering his afib and going

553
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,039
into v-tach so it was one complication

554
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,750
after another so he ends up going in for

555
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,129
the pacemaker in Manchester hospital and

556
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,390
we figure I we don't know what type of

557
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,580
anesthesia they're gonna give them

558
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,860
what's it's wean them off wean him down

559
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:39,629
for a couple days bring him in all the

560
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:42,269
nausea comes screaming back they get the

561
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,370
pacemaker in but there isn't a single

562
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:46,170
drug in that hospital that will get rid

563
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:48,659
of the nausea and so we ask okay where's

564
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,610
where's the Marinol can we you have dry

565
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,009
little insight and they're like now that

566
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:55,109
one is locked away we don't have easy

567
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:57,869
access to that thing and so we're like

568
00:23:55,109 --> 00:24:00,959
well can we just give them some CBD like

569
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:02,339
not on site after about

570
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,620
day of this they realized he's getting

571
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:06,658
dehydrated it's not under control

572
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,278
bless the nurses involved in this field

573
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,500
because they just said you know go get

574
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:12,359
it and we're gonna lock the door and and

575
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,710
do what you got to do 30 minutes later

576
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,959
he stood up and walked out of there and

577
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,419
they look like they saw a ghost every

578
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,880
one of them was interested in CBD and

579
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,980
that is something we need to do more of

580
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,360
and I also throw it to the vets out

581
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,970
there I'm finding a lot of people who

582
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:29,158
have who have pets that have have cancer

583
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,750
or have other types of pain and the vets

584
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,669
are on it like no problem

585
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,140
CBD you got it let's get it order it

586
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:36,179
online and we'll give it to them and

587
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,038
it's not the exact percentage who cares

588
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,820
it's you know these dogs are facing some

589
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:46,788
some some grim circumstances no doubt I

590
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:49,168
give my dog CBD a little THC every day

591
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:51,359
he's got bad hips he's an English

592
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:57,778
Bulldog she's got you know bad hip

593
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:59,849
dysplasia and he's gonna turn ten and I

594
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:02,099
mean since giving him the you know a

595
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:04,648
little tank sure else put it on his food

596
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:05,398
I mean he's like a puppy again it's

597
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:07,949
pretty amazing

598
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:10,168
it's funny how with animals were

599
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,778
preventative most of time but humans

600
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:14,788
were more reparative I give I have a

601
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:17,308
little chihuahua no teeth same age ten

602
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:19,648
and she's you know jumps up and down too

603
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:21,569
much frail give her some CBD and it's

604
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:23,278
like boom just takes off you know and

605
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:24,720
they want it like you they know when

606
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:25,169
you're bringing it out to the show here

607
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,269
it comes

608
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:30,270
yeah so just we gotta get in the same

609
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:36,480
mindset as animals yeah they're much

610
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:38,339
simpler yeah I think the way to change

611
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,870
hearts is through their family members

612
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:42,089
and and we see this and as the

613
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:45,209
population is aging we are gonna have a

614
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:47,849
demographic shift on the elderly needing

615
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,110
access to this and and it's very true

616
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,699
we're finding many of the people of our

617
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:52,319
age have parents now that are starting

618
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,480
to who were probably vehemently against

619
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,519
it when they were when we were kids for

620
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,759
all the scare mongering reasons we know

621
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,470
about are now wide awake and open to it

622
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,808
and I think it's a very good thing and

623
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,829
we can't we need to keep our intention

624
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:06,990
on that generation because I think

625
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:08,519
they're good very high medical care

626
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,500
expenses happen there and that's where

627
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:11,579
the system is gonna break so we're gonna

628
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,740
figure impact there

629
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:19,169
cannabinoids no dough yeah so tell us

630
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,150
more about Tommy Chong's experience I

631
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,800
understand he started off really strong

632
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,780
recreational advocate and of course

633
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,509
ended up with prostate cancer himself

634
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:30,029
and and and curing it with CBD yeah yeah

635
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:31,170
yeah - cancer scares actually first was

636
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:34,079
the prostate cancer

637
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,769
first and foremost Tommy you know he's

638
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,869
pretty much as you see him is how he is

639
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:41,460
but he is such a believer of the plant I

640
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:43,709
mean in all space I mean I'm

641
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,870
anytime I run across a new CBD cream or

642
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,370
anything he's willing to be like the guy

643
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:49,379
that tries that out and see how it works

644
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:51,299
you know he's a great test pilot but

645
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,740
when it comes down to like treating his

646
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:54,509
cancer you know it was a pretty big

647
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,890
scare the prostate cancer initially was

648
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:58,680
like okay this was gonna be a tough one

649
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,420
and he did really good with that and

650
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,549
then when it you know we beat that and

651
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,800
then within a year it returned you know

652
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:06,419
as rectal cancer and now those one that

653
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,460
one usually takes you out you know you

654
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,950
don't really pull off the rectal cancer

655
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,079
but he he was like diligent about it he

656
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,789
watched his diet he you know was doing a

657
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:18,089
fair dose so he tried to stay away from

658
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:19,619
the chemo but a lot of CBD a lot of CBD

659
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:21,449
suppositories to really kind of get

660
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,889
there and do it and you know I remember

661
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,450
Tommy going through that and we were in

662
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,420
Vegas when he made the announcement and

663
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,190
you could see it in him and it was like

664
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,220
okay is this gonna you know he's just

665
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,509
turned 80 years old but he never gave up

666
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,650
you know you always believed the plant

667
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:36,420
could heal and me always you know

668
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,840
everybody was a doubter as doctors were

669
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,450
a doubter

670
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:40,409
and he ended up pulling it you know he

671
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,350
had to have the you know he has a

672
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,060
colostomy bag now but he's alive and

673
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:46,859
he's looking really good and he's still

674
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:49,919
doing bunch of shows you know with

675
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:50,909
Cheech and and when we go do dispensary

676
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,440
visits that's the one thing I really

677
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,570
like working with Tommy is he gets out

678
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,039
and talks to the to the actual patients

679
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:59,399
and shares their stories with them and

680
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:02,430
you know people are coming up you know I

681
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,370
used cannabis for my epilepsy or I have

682
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,570
you know shaky like that we have a guy

683
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:08,159
that works at our work he has an extra

684
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:10,649
chromosome it's like helps settle down

685
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,870
his chromosome if you take CBD and you

686
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:15,450
know so he's always wanting to learn and

687
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:16,529
then to that point we educate people as

688
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,759
they're coming through the line to get

689
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:20,279
his autograph for whatever he'll have

690
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,839
intimate conversations with them and as

691
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:24,240
an influencer I think that's really

692
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,439
important because you have the ability

693
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,849
to change someone's

694
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,250
now these people are usually already

695
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:30,628
consuming cannabis but then those people

696
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,909
go back to their family and again it's

697
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:34,888
at daisy chain reaction so you know

698
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:37,500
while tommy is a campy guy at times he's

699
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:40,288
really you know his mission I feel he's

700
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,538
he feels like he's made his mark and

701
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:44,460
he's paid his dues and I think he's very

702
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:46,408
pleased with the state of cannabis right

703
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,269
now but I think he sees that we have a

704
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:49,889
long way to go still and you know he's

705
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:52,079
willing to do the hard work and get

706
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:55,048
boots on the ground well to Mike's point

707
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,490
I found that when you give lab tours you

708
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:57,750
you start to win people over these

709
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,940
people are afraid of this and they see

710
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,859
all this technology's mass affects these

711
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,909
sequencers all tearing apart this plant

712
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:05,908
and they realize what wait a minute this

713
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:07,470
isn't just about bongs and they see that

714
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:10,278
there's regimented science behind it so

715
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:12,778
if you own a lab please give tours local

716
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:13,769
politicians and anyone who seems to be

717
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:15,298
concerned about this because I think

718
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:16,798
that is one thing that really turns

719
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:17,878
people over when they see that there is

720
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,859
a tremendous amount of scientific

721
00:29:17,878 --> 00:29:22,349
horsepower being applied to this plan

722
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:23,699
and in many ways the testing regulations

723
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:24,808
for cannabis you'll you won't get any of

724
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,370
the food in the grocery store to get

725
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:28,798
through this stuff right this is this is

726
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:30,268
above and beyond what we have for most

727
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,220
of the produce in the field and no one

728
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:34,109
knows that and I think it's important to

729
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,179
show them that we've also been doing

730
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:37,740
some work with even high school students

731
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,360
we've been touring around that we also

732
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,159
have some interns here as well where

733
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,439
we're trying to get that younger

734
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,580
generation and this is tough in high

735
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,750
school because if you like what are you

736
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:47,519
talking about you're gonna send your

737
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,750
students around through a cannabis

738
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,329
testing laboratory their parents are

739
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,038
gonna kill us but it works out and you

740
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:54,898
then get them very intrigued at a young

741
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,819
age to want to march into this field and

742
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:57,778
go into college thinking about alright I

743
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:00,359
want to get involved in botany or

744
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:02,099
genetics or something else so I think

745
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,658
this is the influencing side of this is

746
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:07,859
really important and we have to take our

747
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:10,019
times do it I know just to add Tommy has

748
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:11,519
always been a big proponent of testing I

749
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:13,470
mean even before regulations were put

750
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,990
into place he was very adamant about

751
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,460
making sure that we know we visited the

752
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,750
labs I'll be visiting a lot next week

753
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,819
another new one I mean the other thing

754
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,609
is that these labs are still kind of

755
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,769
dialing in these these devices and it's

756
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:27,569
a it's moving pretty fast people don't

757
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:30,028
realize the investments that these labs

758
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:32,849
are having to make to actually stay up

759
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:34,648
to regulation on time with Bureau and

760
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:36,059
then you got the the influx I mean it's

761
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:39,329
just crazy demand and flow

762
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:41,730
of cannabis non-tested we tested

763
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:42,899
cannabis do you have it is it packaged

764
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,910
properly I mean there's been a lot of

765
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,950
crazy regulations that have come down

766
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,570
the pipe and I think the biggest piece

767
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,980
as consumers that you should always try

768
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:52,109
to make sure you remember is that you

769
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,220
you really vote with your dollar so make

770
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:54,869
sure you're paying attention to the

771
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,190
brands that you're purchasing and you're

772
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,839
supporting the ones that are trying to

773
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:00,360
do the best work and not just the ones

774
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,500
that have the highest THC or the ones

775
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,169
that you know you think gonna get the

776
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,250
most results out of try to focus on you

777
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,480
know who the players are and what

778
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,670
they're doing it right the reasons why

779
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,440
they're doing it yeah I mean I see the

780
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,789
testing space not just as keeping people

781
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,070
honest but it's discovery engine we saw

782
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:16,049
today people are bumping into CBG plants

783
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:17,460
which we haven't had much access to so

784
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:20,659
if we're not doing this testing we're

785
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,660
not gonna be discovering those things

786
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:29,339
how have you seen the is the NFL against

787
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:36,170
just THC do they care about CBD do they

788
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:40,409
even know what CVG is you know I don't

789
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:44,640
THC is what they have listed on the

790
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:47,610
banned substance list okay you know I've

791
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:52,259
had some debates they claimed even

792
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:55,109
taking a CBD isolate product you would

793
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:57,150
test positive on an NFL drug test and

794
00:31:55,109 --> 00:32:00,990
the way the drug testing works in the

795
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:05,400
NFL is there's an annual street drugs

796
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:08,130
test which cannabis is on and so you

797
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,600
have but you you know you have a general

798
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,920
idea of when that test is going to

799
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,679
happen it's going to happen sometime

800
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,590
between the first day you get to the

801
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:20,430
facility in April to about the first

802
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:22,740
week in training camp so you know you

803
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,930
have all of spring and then basically

804
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,609
some if you're not tested some time in

805
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:28,289
there then you know you're definitely

806
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:30,269
getting at that first week in training

807
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:32,369
camp and then you're free to consume

808
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:35,119
cannabis as you need it if you're one of

809
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:38,189
those guys I was one of those guys and

810
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,409
you know thank God I was I wouldn't be

811
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,990
in the shape I am now if it wasn't for

812
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:45,230
cannabis

813
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:47,528
and you know that's the truth I I don't

814
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,610
see it any other way I've seen guys who

815
00:32:47,528 --> 00:32:51,710
coming out of the league and they've got

816
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:55,219
bottles of pills trailing behind them

817
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:57,558
you know and when you get cut and you

818
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,298
have a box of stuff from your locker

819
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,548
those pill bottles are in there and

820
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:04,038
you're really dependent on those you

821
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:05,960
know to deal with the nagging injuries

822
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:08,569
you're leaving the team with whatever

823
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,278
surgeries you've had you know that are

824
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:13,308
still that are you know you're still

825
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:16,240
having pain from and that now there's no

826
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:21,200
one to help you you know figure out

827
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:24,169
organize your healing regimen you know

828
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,690
and so you're going home and these guys

829
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:28,759
are diving into you know opiate

830
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,139
addiction whatever pills they have

831
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,419
available to them and they're losing

832
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:35,209
their minds you know and meanwhile

833
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:38,090
there's this thing that's non-toxic that

834
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:43,340
could really save them and their

835
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:46,009
families a great deal of pain so you

836
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:48,378
know the NFL really I've sat across the

837
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:52,069
desk from the director of player

838
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:54,079
wellness at the NFLPA and having a

839
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:56,808
conversation when are we gonna start

840
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,548
looking at cannabis you know why aren't

841
00:33:56,808 --> 00:34:00,259
you doing that and really she didn't

842
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:03,378
want to hear any of it you know she

843
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:06,528
didn't she was really scared to have

844
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:09,409
that talk with me and that was

845
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:12,469
unfortunate you know you have this

846
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:14,720
doctor who you know can't even really

847
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:18,348
begin to have a conversation about

848
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:22,519
something that actually will help so you

849
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:26,659
know I think it's uh it's a bit of a

850
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:29,318
fiasco with the NFL frankly as far as

851
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:32,960
player wellness and player health goes

852
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:35,119
but I think that you know even them

853
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,539
having the conversation Roger Goodell

854
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:41,329
making statements about it there's been

855
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:44,329
a handful of players in the league now

856
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:47,839
who have come out and had positive

857
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:49,609
comments about cannabis as a defensive

858
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,119
end for the Cowboys most recently I

859
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:53,308
think David Irving

860
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,048
he said you know I know what these pills

861
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:57,839
do to me I don't want to put him in my

862
00:34:55,048 --> 00:35:00,679
body and there's this plant that I can

863
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,880
use and it helps me helps me feel better

864
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:05,338
you know and it's really as simple as

865
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,970
that but you know the NFL wants to twist

866
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:11,998
it into that guy's an individual he is

867
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:18,088
destructive to the league and you know

868
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:20,578
he's not NFL caliber so you know I think

869
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:23,969
that continuing to push the science and

870
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,798
understanding that and also as well as

871
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:28,588
you know of having a really positive

872
00:35:25,798 --> 00:35:29,880
effect on the NFL's bottom line having

873
00:35:28,588 --> 00:35:33,119
healthier players leave the league

874
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,700
spending less money on pills etc you

875
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,950
know I think that they could make you

876
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:41,848
know get a benefit from it and the

877
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:44,548
myriad ways let's include the audience a

878
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:46,079
little bit do you have any feel free to

879
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:48,298
jump up to the microphone do you have

880
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,670
any other compelling stories or cases

881
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:52,798
that have helped like turn people what

882
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,200
are methods that can help become very

883
00:35:52,798 --> 00:35:56,130
potent influencers hi thank you for

884
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,808
doing this

885
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,358
I just want to share that I've been

886
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:03,630
doing education for about a decade now

887
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,460
and down in San Diego County which was

888
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,519
one of the toughest counties in

889
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,749
California and the average age of the

890
00:36:08,518 --> 00:36:16,108
people I work with is 67 this revelation

891
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:19,949
in the media that oh the new user of

892
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:22,139
cannabis is the boomer is I don't buy it

893
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:24,629
because I've been helping these people

894
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:27,659
and the the difference is they're afraid

895
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:30,450
to admit that they use it

896
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:32,730
my husband 64 he just came out of the

897
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:36,149
cannabis closet three years ago where

898
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:39,150
he'll will only say this is what I do to

899
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,858
help with my situation and we believe

900
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,798
that he's alive today because of

901
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:46,619
cannabis you know Evan not to the degree

902
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:48,748
that you are but for various health

903
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:51,298
reasons so I see I've seen thousands of

904
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:53,669
people over the last ten years really

905
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:55,498
good success I'm glad to be part of

906
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:58,048
today I'd like to invite you all to come

907
00:36:55,498 --> 00:36:59,509
and see our Center in Oceanside

908
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:01,829
California and see what we're doing

909
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,490
thank you what's the name of your second

910
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:05,940
two

911
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:09,299
all right this is about connections I

912
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,710
think I have won it we mention hi my

913
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,350
name is Amanda Crawford I'm with my

914
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:17,309
chain I'm so a couple of things plus a

915
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:18,960
question would be you know one the the

916
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:22,079
main question that I've seen really cut

917
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,880
through to people is are you in pain do

918
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,400
you know someone in pain is your mom in

919
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,840
pain what's going on and just being able

920
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,660
to start the conversation from that

921
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,730
point and also at what we're doing with

922
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:34,980
my Jane is meeting meeting women where

923
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,170
they're at which is they want to stay in

924
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,030
the cannabis closet and they want to be

925
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:43,190
educated while they're still in the

926
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:45,150
closet two and a half minutes okay so

927
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,429
you know we're approaching education

928
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,470
kind of from that where we bring it into

929
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:52,049
people's homes what do you guys see on

930
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:54,539
the horizon of for education platforms

931
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,780
you know of the future you know I know I

932
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:59,699
know with um with the media channel that

933
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,530
you have you know do you have any

934
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:03,149
insights into you know kind of what's

935
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,650
going on you know green flower media is

936
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,619
a great resource but what else are you

937
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:11,280
guys seeing out there so I you know I

938
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:13,380
think the the way that new customers or

939
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,690
patients can get educated is somewhat

940
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,970
fractured and people that are in the

941
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,079
closet if you will are probably not

942
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:20,969
going to pick up a high x they're

943
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:23,940
probably not going to do much research

944
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:27,509
online or follow anybody on social media

945
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:30,690
or go to a cup so I think you know it's

946
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:32,580
it's one of those things where again we

947
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,260
have to create this normalization in

948
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,449
society and you have to be willing to

949
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,580
share so if somebody isn't out of the

950
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:40,679
cannabis closet my recommendation is

951
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:43,230
share with them articles share with them

952
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,819
you know a social media channel that

953
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,559
they want to follow maybe you know they

954
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,970
don't want to follow the gnarliest you

955
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,730
know cannabis heads out there but they

956
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:53,608
there are tons and tons of social media

957
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:56,309
channels and videos and articles that

958
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:58,230
can be shared I try to keep a few going

959
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:00,119
out to people that I think it can help I

960
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,650
mean you don't want to always you don't

961
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,090
want to be that pushy person because I

962
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,320
think you know when you're in cannabis

963
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,880
and everybody automatically I don't want

964
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,109
to smoke I'm not looking to smoke it I'm

965
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,269
just asking some questions and you're

966
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:10,409
like I'm not gonna try to smoke with you

967
00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:12,269
right now you're asking me questions I'm

968
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:14,699
trying to answer them so I think that's

969
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:16,259
you know compiled some education that

970
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:18,750
you feel is really helpful

971
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,580
the in-home thing is a beautiful idea I

972
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,409
mean I think I'd love to talk more with

973
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,909
that about with that about you you know

974
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:25,739
so we can see how we can maybe help with

975
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:29,789
that that would be amazing

976
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:33,119
I'll catch you after this I've been

977
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:36,679
taking acid cannabinoids for about seven

978
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,019
years and I think about sometimes

979
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:42,569
different types of sports if I were to

980
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:47,009
compete against people who wasn't taking

981
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:48,809
it - the fact would I be doping but I

982
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:55,620
thought well maybe there should be a

983
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:58,739
team called the th CAS nice and you're

984
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:05,609
talking raw cannabinoid acids right not

985
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:18,179
acid and cannabinoids like 9ca

986
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:22,590
right proper distinction called canna

987
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:23,129
Club Ivan has spoken to us you're

988
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:26,880
awesome

989
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:30,869
thank you I think reaching out to

990
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,660
students college students is a huge huge

991
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:36,449
thing right now it's I guess moving

992
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:39,329
forward with the youth even with just

993
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:42,480
their interest but also with how curious

994
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:45,750
they are on an academic level so I

995
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,730
really really want not just y'all but

996
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,679
everyone in the room to kind of reach

997
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,690
out to students and teach them we want

998
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,469
to learn about all this and we want to

999
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:57,170
be part of all this and there are age

1000
00:40:54,469 --> 00:41:00,569
demographics to focus on like the older

1001
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:03,720
consumer but students also want to be a

1002
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:05,940
part of that and help older people kind

1003
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:08,879
of get situated with cannabis as well as

1004
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,980
us learning simultaneously but I wanted

1005
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,960
to thank you Evan for coming and

1006
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,539
speaking to us students I really hope

1007
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,849
some of you cannabis industry leaders

1008
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:21,329
and professionals take the chance and

1009
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:23,549
educate even the youth and let them know

1010
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:25,500
what this is all about it's not just a

1011
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,420
drug it could help their parents it

1012
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,489
could help them streamline their

1013
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,099
streamline their career and to help

1014
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:34,979
others and yeah I really want to see

1015
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:38,220
more effort with kids college kids and

1016
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:44,039
the college market and see what we could

1017
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:45,689
do as a youth in cannabis excellent you

1018
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:48,599
guys should definitely if you get a

1019
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,730
chance go speak at the can of club these

1020
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,380
guys are doing great work I mean I think

1021
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,269
there's something really to that you

1022
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,390
know there should be cannabis 101 at

1023
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:59,699
universities across America I agree you

1024
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:09,929
should be able to take a class and learn

1025
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:12,509
yeah hell yeah our own cannabis 101

1026
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:15,019
curriculum it was organized and designed

1027
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:17,790
by students for students because

1028
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:20,009
administration isn't going to you know

1029
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:28,650
instill a new academic cannabis program

1030
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:30,480
so we started it dr. Chen it took a lot

1031
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,579
of time but you know we had the support

1032
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,829
of other industry leaders and we had

1033
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:36,929
your support even to even speak to us

1034
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:38,549
and speak to other student athletes but

1035
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,279
know we've started a curriculum we have

1036
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:44,460
it every two weeks Kat Packer will be

1037
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,910
talking on November 14th speaking about

1038
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,260
the current LA atmosphere and stuff on

1039
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:52,409
cannabis but know we've already started

1040
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,300
a curriculum and I really hope it gets

1041
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:56,730
to the administration we're doing our

1042
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,400
best us students but we also need the

1043
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:01,588
support of I guess the industry leaders

1044
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,300
and the people who've been in the game

1045
00:43:01,588 --> 00:43:10,529
for longer than we have

1046
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:12,960
so ya know thank you alright this is

1047
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:15,180
great Ben good to see you again good to

1048
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,650
see you my name is Michael Masterman

1049
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:17,929
Smith and I'm the cancer biologist here

1050
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:22,170
and I'll be presenting tomorrow on

1051
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:23,779
aspects of Connect Thank You cancer yeah

1052
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:27,269
well I think what you guys are doing

1053
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:29,250
that's sort of my you know scientific

1054
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:30,929
but political contribution because

1055
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,730
there's a lot of you know you get when

1056
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:34,169
you reach people on a real level of just

1057
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,338
like you know like Kevin says it's like

1058
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,019
you know we got some banged up players

1059
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:40,440
they need to be taken care of and my

1060
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:41,690
question is - really I'm I'm trying to

1061
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,250
understand this concept

1062
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:45,170
how do we in a political environment

1063
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,789
we're supposed to be you know we have to

1064
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:50,809
be advocates for what we're doing but at

1065
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:53,090
the same time where do we decide forget

1066
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:55,340
trying to convince the people that

1067
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:58,190
aren't going to be convinced and how do

1068
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:00,140
we build our relationships anew each

1069
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,760
person has an individual is like you

1070
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:04,549
work with dana-farber maybe talk about

1071
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,800
what was that like to deal with the

1072
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,690
doctors and talk to the doctors

1073
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,480
and what was what was that what were

1074
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,980
they responsive to and maybe evan answer

1075
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,380
this question is is that who was

1076
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:17,780
responsive who were the folks that will

1077
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:20,690
be a part of this a part of this

1078
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,340
movement that we can talk to because we

1079
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,690
know we're gonna be you know it's it's

1080
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:28,100
almost like let's should we be in denial

1081
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:30,559
of the guys that don't want to do enter

1082
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:33,679
just have some opposition to it and just

1083
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:35,929
focused on who's receptive or maybe what

1084
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,480
percentage do we put up the fight to the

1085
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:40,009
ones who don't want to listen and versus

1086
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,150
the percentage of folks who are hey

1087
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,930
listen we're gonna get all these other

1088
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:45,800
folks on board and let's focus on their

1089
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:47,149
you know give me that give me that

1090
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,530
perspective I'll give you that

1091
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,059
perspective those are the people who

1092
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:52,280
don't want to learn just don't waste

1093
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:53,750
your time on them because go after the

1094
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,280
people who want to learn who want to be

1095
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,079
educated because those are the ones that

1096
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,440
you're gonna turn into advocates and and

1097
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:02,659
zealots and the future of cannabis the

1098
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,090
people who are staunch like sonshi

1099
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:08,029
against it you're gonna waste a lot of

1100
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:09,980
time with those folks get get the large

1101
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,890
part of the herd and let them convince

1102
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:15,860
the other guys later on that's what I

1103
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:17,269
that's how I mark it I I would agree

1104
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,460
with that and I'll weigh in on the

1105
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:20,750
dana-farber experiences that we found it

1106
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,670
was best to be able to speak in their

1107
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,739
language you know we we walked in there

1108
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:26,690
with the DNA sequence of the tumor which

1109
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:29,000
Dana Farber loves to sequence tumors you

1110
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,730
know and we're like look we have this

1111
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,230
yeah and they've worked with Stan Nelson

1112
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,190
whose great work in this field it's

1113
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,230
sequence for the first glioblastoma

1114
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,730
genomes right and so you walk in with

1115
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,260
that saying this is pointing to a KT

1116
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,369
inhibitors and here's ten papers on

1117
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,630
cannabinoids being potent ones

1118
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:44,210
everything else you're offering his face

1119
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:47,030
to be these aren't these aren't you know

1120
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,230
they're non-toxic and he was just let's

1121
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:50,269
do it

1122
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:52,610
and so I think it helped going in there

1123
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:54,170
with speaking their language I think if

1124
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,930
we didn't have those that sequencing

1125
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,028
data and we didn't

1126
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:58,288
those papers he just would have been

1127
00:45:57,028 --> 00:45:59,699
like you know if you want to do it for

1128
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,660
pain that's fine it's off our books we

1129
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:02,578
don't want to know about it but we're

1130
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:04,469
not giving to get in your way it that

1131
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:06,359
that conversation changed to being okay

1132
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:09,000
let's do the sequencing in his

1133
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:10,858
bloodstream every quarter if we can that

1134
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,179
way we can monitor the the mutation that

1135
00:46:10,858 --> 00:46:13,889
we found in this blood stream because

1136
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:14,818
the PSA numbers gone we can't trust that

1137
00:46:13,889 --> 00:46:17,969
anymore after you went through

1138
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:20,038
immunotherapy it dis wrecked it so that

1139
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:22,439
that really is what I think brought them

1140
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:23,220
in and so I'm glad that you're here

1141
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,048
because you're doing this type of work

1142
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:27,899
as well and I think there's more will

1143
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:30,269
convince more oncologists if we are on

1144
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,410
that that table with them yeah well I'm

1145
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:33,269
gonna tell you I wouldn't be here if it

1146
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:36,629
wasn't for the audience that would be

1147
00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:39,449
interested this is these are things that

1148
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,680
is in the cancer community we we were

1149
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:42,358
always a part of it we always knew it

1150
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:43,828
but unless we had a unless you had a

1151
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:45,480
movement behind us we were not really

1152
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:48,420
going to be able to come up here do and

1153
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,818
be vocal about it so I'm like that

1154
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,010
leading edge and I'm gonna keep on going

1155
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:54,599
and you know you can you can tell all

1156
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,430
your friends that yes cannabinoids can

1157
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,278
be used to treat cancer we're getting

1158
00:46:56,429 --> 00:47:01,048
there and so maybe that's some of the

1159
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:04,139
things that I that folks like me entered

1160
00:47:01,048 --> 00:47:05,519
to the conversation but support the

1161
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:07,170
physicians support the folks that are

1162
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:08,130
trying to do the medical aspects of it I

1163
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:12,059
think that's going to be a great

1164
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:14,400
potential but media guy what are you

1165
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:17,609
gonna do when you're in your talks and

1166
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:25,670
in your in your podcast we party last

1167
00:47:17,608 --> 00:47:29,578
night I forget you guys are the coolest

1168
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:32,548
you know for us it really is our desire

1169
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:34,619
to become the platform where people feel

1170
00:47:32,548 --> 00:47:36,719
comfortable learning about cannabis

1171
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,680
whether it's through a podcast whether

1172
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:39,179
it's through watching one of our

1173
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,969
broadcasts whether it's through

1174
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:46,129
listening to us on you know or following

1175
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:48,538
us on social media I think you know I

1176
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:50,880
agree with Big Mike about not

1177
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:54,329
necessarily the pursuing people that

1178
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,980
don't have a have an inclination to to

1179
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:58,470
embrace cannabis but I think at the same

1180
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,298
time it is a round like you do it around

1181
00:47:58,469 --> 00:48:02,969
everybody and eventually that one last

1182
00:48:00,298 --> 00:48:05,038
person gets split and I think that's

1183
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:06,889
going to take some time you know so for

1184
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,030
us it's really about you know trying to

1185
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:11,699
not hype things

1186
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:13,290
you know like this everything is

1187
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:15,210
different for every customer so just

1188
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:16,829
really helping people understand what

1189
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,780
they did what edibles will do to you and

1190
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:19,970
what micro dosing means and you know

1191
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,589
kind of some of the basics around

1192
00:48:19,969 --> 00:48:24,088
consumption is really where we try to

1193
00:48:22,588 --> 00:48:25,588
focus because that's where we have them

1194
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:27,150
right at the point-of-sale there that's

1195
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:28,769
they're watching a TV right before

1196
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,980
they're about to walk in or it's in the

1197
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:33,838
flower room so we try to have the brands

1198
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,420
give have a good call to action and

1199
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,429
really try to provide an answer and you

1200
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,329

1201
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:40,769
