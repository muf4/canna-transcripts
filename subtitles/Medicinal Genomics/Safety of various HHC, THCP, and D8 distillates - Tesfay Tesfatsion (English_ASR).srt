1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,320
uh good afternoon uh my name is Tes Tes

2
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,960
faton I work for sunflower wellness and

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,519
uh Colorado chomatography uh we are

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,760
based in Denver Colorado or Hudson um

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:23,640
and our talk will be on safety profile

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:26,840
of hhc THC and thcp um I know a lot of

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,960
people don't like the talk about hhc or

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:32,159
any of these partial and synthetic

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,160
avoids but uh we wanted to see what the

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,359
safety is and how we can basically start

11
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,759
to incorporate these type of studies

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:43,119
into uh the market to give people the uh

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,799
information so they can make their own

14
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,799
informed

15
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,119
opinion so today we'll outline

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:56,280
introduction methodology results

17
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:59,959
discussion um and then uh

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,280
conclusion so so far uh through all the

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,478
literature that we search uh CBD THC um

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,640
CBC there's a lot of information about

21
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:11,519
uh safety study uh because of uh very

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,359
abundance within the cannabis plant uh

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:19,798
in terms of hemp products uh even Delta

24
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,319
9 THC from hemp or thcp or hhc very

25
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,840
little is known out there uh in

26
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,839
literature search uh we can't really

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,640
find too

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,920
many uh so and a lot of these uh uh I

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,640
guess safety or potency are done through

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,960
H uh using hplc and as well as uh GC uh

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,399
the problem with those is some of the

32
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,239
contaminants and some of the impurities

33
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,680
are not easily visible um so people

34
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,560
assume that they're getting a 99% pure

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,280
material and actuality there might be

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,759
some impurities that might be in there

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,359
um and the other thing is inv vitro

38
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,680
studies are not easily done a lot of

39
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,560
people don't have one the money and two

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,118
it's just not understood well enough to

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,960
be able to be presented um on the side

42
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,239
uh you can see all the different uh I

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,719
guess isomers you can have when you are

44
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:13,479
trying to convert CBD to THC uh there's

45
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:16,080
EXO ISO many different uh um I guess

46
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,439
structural isomers um that are not

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,080
really well known uh as well as not

48
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:23,400
easily separated to be able to be used

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,640
for mro

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,920
study uh this is just an outline of some

51
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:30,000
of the uh biological testing using MTT

52
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,238
assay to be able to determine that

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,560
amount of cell

54
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,159
viability um and then characterization

55
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,719
using hplc mobile phase a column as

56
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,439
being a stationary phase uh and uh

57
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,598
injecting your sample and then doing a

58
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:46,039
pre clinical

59
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:49,158
study previously um well hhc has been

60
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:52,280
around uh probably the past like 3 years

61
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:55,359
uh it has taken over uh in a lot of

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,840
states that don't have uh THC as easily

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,319
accessible um AKA a lot of the southern

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,840
states are not easily um you can get THC

65
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:09,878
so hhc is being a supplement um to get

66
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,799
people the euphoria that they uh desire

67
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:15,359
um so um it's easier to find whether

68
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,680
it's gas station or any of those places

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,480
uh the problem is not a lot of people

70
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,480
know what they are um so previously uh

71
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:25,318
we did a study uh determining whether uh

72
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:29,359
hhc has any effect on your heart um

73
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:32,438
using a her uh Channel or um ION channel

74
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,400
study to determine to see what is and if

75
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:35,959
it has any effect on your sodium

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
pottassium channel to give you any type

77
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,680
of issue with your heart and what we

78
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:43,119
found was using a positive control uh we

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,920
we didn't see any uh inhibition or very

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,438
minimum inhibition in comparison to the

81
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,598
positive control at a very low

82
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:54,000
micromolar in addition we also conducted

83
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:58,479
uh uh fiberblast cytotoxicity just to

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,560
see how that affects uh the lungs um and

85
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,959
from there we did see a little bit

86
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,079
cytotoxicity so um just like a lot of

87
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,400
cannabinoid or a lot of other compounds

88
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,920
there is some cytotoxicity to it uh in

89
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,560
terms of the he hepatocytes uh that's

90
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,719
where we see a very low cytotoxicity

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,680
even at a higher concentration at above

92
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:24,280
U 50 micro Moler um so this is an

93
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,560
earlier study that we did um uh so to

94
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:29,079
determine to make sure that hey one the

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,079
product is safe and two uh the

96
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,758
information is out there there so that

97
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:37,399
people can make their own informed

98
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:40,080
decision um in this uh I guess

99
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,560
presentation we used NMR as a way to

100
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,519
determine structural um using 500

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,360
megahertz um hplc again the standard way

102
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:51,519
of determining pocy impurity uh us we

103
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,080
did an aelin 1100 as well as a uh

104
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,879
shimatsu as a secondary checkpoint uh

105
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:01,038
the crms were purchased from uh Cayman

106
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:03,319
chemicals um and then solve ACS or hlc

107
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,918
grade and then so we we try to

108
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,959
collaborate with a lot of the uh

109
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:11,079
industrial uh uh players uh Jonesy lab

110
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,079
AV labs and e-commerce that were we

111
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,519
purchased these materials uh with uh the

112
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,680
understanding and letting them know that

113
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,560
hey we're going to conduct this type of

114
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,360
study so we want to get as many people

115
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,038
as possible so that way we can put all

116
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,160
the information out

117
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:28,719
there on the cell viability assay uh was

118
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,160
conducted with uh HB biosciences um so

119
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,400
three cell lines were

120
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,759
uh utilized in this way uh we have we

121
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:40,519
can mimic the two ways that cannabis or

122
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:44,199
cannabinoids are um I guess uh consumed

123
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:47,038
by pasas uh one of them is using um

124
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,360
small Airway so inhalation to mimic

125
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,038
somebody smoking vaping any of that way

126
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,439
to get the canab in their system um the

127
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:58,599
other way uh is through the liver as in

128
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,000
U using it as a edible uh so to get both

129
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,319
effects to see cytotoxicity both in the

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,120
lungs and in the liver uh the cell lines

131
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,680
the human small Airway epithelial cell

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,120
line as well as the human fiber blast

133
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,360
and then the thle E3 uh transform human

134
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,720
epil uh liver epithel cell all studies

135
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,038
were conducted under NP um again uh this

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,960
was all ran at a third party to get a um

137
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:28,879
no bias uh and also to get it a clear uh

138
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,478
uh information that is not we know we

139
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,439
don't we don't owned in terms of the uh

140
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,079
information or we own the information

141
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,800
but we don't have a bias towards it uh

142
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:42,120
all procedures were uh validated um as

143
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,960
well as signed off by the uh uh the

144
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,319
place that was conducting this uh and

145
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:49,038
the cell lines were purchased by atcc

146
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,439
from atcc uh this is just an outline of

147
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:55,038
the MTT assay uh cells were uh taken

148
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,639
thawed cerused to get rid of the super

149
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:01,159
naan the cells was then uh

150
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,960
resuspended um and added uh uh PBS as

151
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,160
well as tripan blue and then cells were

152
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,839
uh visualized through a microscope to

153
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,080
count it in terms of the viability as

154
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:14,839
well as the uh how many were um

155
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,959
apoptotic uh in terms of synthetic way

156
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,758
um so all the materials were uh we

157
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,799
synthesized in house as well as the ones

158
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,560
that were purchased uh both of them were

159
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,478
purified in two different methods one

160
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,598
was them film distillation and the other

161
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:32,399
was taken as a crude um utilizing uh

162
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:36,159
common synthetic methodology uh CBD was

163
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,758
purchased as is from a hemp uh company

164
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,439
and then cyclisation was done using a

165
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,280
strong acid in this case was pin

166
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:47,360
sulphonic acid monohydrate using a u uh

167
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,799
heptane as a solvent um you get the

168
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,879
reaction goes from progresses from Delta

169
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,680
or uh CBD to Delta 9 to Delta 8 uh

170
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,720
thermodynamic pushes it to more the more

171
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,000
stable uh molecule we we took uh both

172
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,560
the disit and then the uh uh crude

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,879
remove the solvent and the crude and

174
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:12,959
used it as is um similarly with hhc same

175
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:15,680
way uh in this case THC was taken uh uh

176
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,918
hydrogenation was done with it uh using

177
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,800
padium on carbon uh you can use platinum

178
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,359
on carbon there's multiple different uh

179
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,680
catalysts you can use for hydrogenation

180
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,759
with hydrogen and ethanol or different

181
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,038
solvents to be able to get your uh hhc

182
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,800
uh R versus S uh depending on the

183
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,000
catalyst that you use you get a

184
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,759
different variations and different

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,278
splits uh thcp was fully synthetically

186
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:41,759
made uh starting with um resourc andol

187
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:44,399
uh and uh tpine going through

188
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,159
cyclization uh fre craft alation and

189
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,559
then going through the process of U

190
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:54,958
making cbdp then cyclization with tri

191
00:08:50,559 --> 00:09:00,439
Trio aluminum and DCM um getting D9 to

192
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,439
d8 variation of a high D9 to low d8

193
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:07,278
uh the hhc's were on hlc were stagged on

194
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,838
top of one another just to show the

195
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:13,000
different type of impurities that you

196
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,600
can visual uh see uh in here you can see

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,879
uh close to almost eight or nine

198
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,600
different impurities that are in there

199
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,399
um again uh this is the from four

200
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,639
different or five different uh companies

201
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,000
so uh we're not trying to say one is

202
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,838
better than the other it's just showing

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,480
you guys hey these are the impurities

204
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,360
that we see and a lot of them are within

205
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,159
the same uh area that they're coming off

206
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,159
in terms of retention

207
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:40,519
time uh the NMR spectrum of the uh crude

208
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,879
versus distilled hhc um the one thing to

209
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,000
look at in terms of if you want to see

210
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:48,799
the r the ratio of isomer if you look at

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,799
around three PPM you see a doublet and a

212
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,799
doublet uh you can take the integration

213
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,838
of those two uh and compare it and

214
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,399
you'll be able to see what the R versus

215
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,920
S or S versus R ratio of the two

216
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,120
compounds are uh this is just a showing

217
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,159
you the NMR spectrum of each uh you

218
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,679
don't see too many differences between

219
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,639
them um but uh hhc is a little bit

220
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,919
different because then you're taking uh

221
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,759
THC and you're hydrogenating it so

222
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,439
there's a couple of uh purification step

223
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:20,078
that's included in

224
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,360
that uh again same thing with the Delta

225
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:26,599
8 THC um again Delta 8 is not highly

226
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,919
found within the plant but it is when

227
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,959
you are cycing uh H uh THC uh CBD um

228
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:35,919
again you compare it you'll see again

229
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:38,319
about six or seven Peaks uh that are

230
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,599
showing up within the uh

231
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,519
hplc and uh again aatl is in there EXO

232
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,720
ISO there's different isomers of THC in

233
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,799
there as

234
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,399
well again NMR spectrum of it just to uh

235
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,519
confirm that that is a THC using

236
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,839
literature values literature uh

237
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,919
information that's

238
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,920
available uh with this thcp we see

239
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,360
uh almost a two-fold increase in terms

240
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:08,679
of the impurities that are present uh

241
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:11,200
that is because of the uh process of Uhn

242
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,799
synthetically it is a synthesis so you

243
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
can't really find this easily in the

244
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,679
plant and trying to extract it so it is

245
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,200
a synthetic process and some people will

246
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,958
not purify each state they just take one

247
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,360
and go to the other without doing any

248
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,119
purification and then towards the end uh

249
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,839
if you have any impurities that are

250
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,000
carried from the first step those will

251
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:31,360
be carried out throughout the whole

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,240
entire thing and it becomes difficult

253
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,600
later on to try to purify them so some

254
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,320
people just sell the material as is and

255
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,519
say hey it's 98% or 96% or

256
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,760
95% uh Purity but when you look at it in

257
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,919
terms of using other methodologies to

258
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,759
determine the true potency you might see

259
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,159
it a lot less but these are not really

260
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,519
shown in uh in the

261
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:58,199
market um this is the hlc pocy of each

262
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,919
of the cannabinoid uh we separated them

263
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,959
with D9 d8

264
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:08,759
cbdp uh thcp CBN um hhc and uh the

265
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,319
different isomers of hhc um again a lot

266
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,799
of these if you look at them none of

267
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,120
them Reach above 93% Purity uh so that's

268
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,198
a staggering information of hey some of

269
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,879
these materials that say that they are

270
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:22,039
95% cannaboid they're not really 95%

271
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,278
cannaboid there's other cannaboids

272
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:27,799
within there or other uh impurities in

273
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:30,000
there um and then uh so we just yeah

274
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:32,479
this is just the uh breakdown of each of

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,440
the uh samples that we got all of them

276
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:40,159
we gave them a WC uh as their acronym 1

277
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,839
2 3 4 5 just to give them a uh so nobody

278
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:47,439
knows what they are and and information

279
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:50,000
about that and on the right is the hlc

280
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,800
uh area count or the mill absorbance per

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,360
each and we can see that even in the uh

282
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,879
wc1 we're seeing olival still in there

283
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,720
uh some EXO some ISO um and the

284
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,159
different

285
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,959
isomers of cyclisation that comes from

286
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,399
it um again same thing the only ones

287
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,399
that you don't see that is if you look

288
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,078
at

289
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:13,320
wc9 uh the hhc the RNs a lot of the

290
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:14,799
other materials are not there uh that is

291
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,560
because of the multiple process of

292
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:21,120
purification that's involved to go from

293
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:24,039
uh CBD to hhc having the THC in there

294
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,320
and being able to go ahead and uh

295
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:30,799
uh do the purification the problem there

296
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,560
is well what's the hydrogenation version

297
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,759
of the EXO and

298
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,679
ISO that's we don't know uh because not

299
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,799
a lot of literature is out there about

300
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,399
what happens when you hydrogenate other

301
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:44,799
isomers of THC uh this is the one thing

302
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,278
that we want to convey is it's not a

303
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,879
matter of you know if if if they're

304
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,240
there or they're not most likely they're

305
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,439
there but we just don't have any studies

306
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,720
that are being done to uh show what are

307
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:02,000
their to toxicity within the body

308
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:06,440
themselves so using two uh uh positive

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,078
control uh camazine and tadine uh we ran

310
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:13,639
these uh asay uh with uh HD bioscience

311
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:17,359
uh the three compounds uh Delta a THC

312
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,159
hhc um the RS uh isomers and then Delta

313
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,800
9

314
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:24,360
thcp um so if you look at the First

315
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:30,000
Column um hopefully everybody can see

316
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:33,480
that uh using uh the uh lung fibro

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,120
blast we can see the uh ic50 of the

318
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,920
control was at

319
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,959
14.2 micromolar and when you look at

320
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:45,639
every other cannaboid the delta8 in

321
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,278
every single sample everything is below

322
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,079
the

323
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:53,519
ic50 uh so the cannabinoids are

324
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:56,399
cytotoxic to the lungs um again this is

325
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,879
just mimicking controlled versus that uh

326
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,600
our compounds um and when you look at

327
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:05,278
the epithelial cell line for the um

328
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,680
small Airways we see a consistent uh

329
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:14,679
also low cyot toxicity so the ic50 of

330
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:18,000
the uh uh control at five uh or

331
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:20,159
9.3 uh micromolar uh and everything else

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
is way below that some of them are in

333
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,159
two micromolar so very toxic to the the

334
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,240
lungs the other thing that we see is

335
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:31,278
when you compare it to the liver in the

336
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:34,720
liver cell uh tadine is at 5.1

337
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:38,078
micromolar ic50 value everything else is

338
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,959
anywhere between three to 18 times

339
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,359
greater in terms of the ic50 there none

340
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,239
of the canabo are cytotoxic to the liver

341
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,879
um so going through a first pass through

342
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,159
the liver uh these do not cause side

343
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,519
they might add higher doses yes but

344
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,278
within the doses that we were looking at

345
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,959
in terms of control we didn't see any uh

346
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,958
um cyot toxicity

347
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:06,078
so uh although the contaminants were

348
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:08,838
found within each sample uh the

349
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,078
preclinical testing resulted in showing

350
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,160
that all the cannabinoids had an effect

351
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:16,479
or cytotoxic effect to the lung uh the

352
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:20,039
fiberblast as well as the uh epithelial

353
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:26,079
cell lines um all all every single

354
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:29,318
canabo Delta 8 um and uh TCP HC were all

355
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,758
cytotoxic um except for the uh transfer

356
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:34,120
human Liber um epithelial cell lines

357
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,399
there was no they were toxic but not at

358
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,720
the concentration that we were looking

359
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:43,240
at everything was above the

360
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:48,920
controlled the only thing was uh the

361
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:52,159
wc6 uh had a high uh side uh High ic50

362
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:54,039
values uh the reason for that was when

363
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,360
you uh when I was when we were looking

364
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:59,159
at it the concentration of material that

365
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:03,120
was in there was about 25%

366
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:05,038
so it was RS and a total was 25%

367
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,038
cannaboid the rest of the material we

368
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,959
don't know what it is um so having less

369
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:13,720
canabo was able to show that there's not

370
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,038
the ic50 was a lot higher than uh it

371
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,038
should have

372
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,759
been uh the research uh underscores the

373
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,799
critical need for rigorous scientific uh

374
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,160
inquiries uh because we want to make

375
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,759
sure that all the information is out

376
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,960
there given people the uh understanding

377
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:34,679
of what is within the sample that you're

378
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:39,400
purchasing um and what you are consuming

379
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:44,600
um understanding Delta H THC uh Delta 48

380
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:49,519
ISO EXO uh the different U isomer of uh

381
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:52,480
THC uh could or represent a uh potential

382
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,440
risk for users due to the lack of

383
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,720
pharmacological understanding and

384
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,480
characterization um the lack of

385
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,919
understanding could lead to unforeseen

386
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,558
levels of uh intoxication as well as uh

387
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,038
the uh effect that these compounds can

388
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:11,119
have on

389
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:14,919
somebody so in conclusion uh Delta 8 hhc

390
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:17,678
and Delta 9 thcp all exhibited

391
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,520
cytotoxicity to the lung both in the uh

392
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,000
fiber blast as well as the uh small

393
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,359
Airways um none of them had a

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,279
cytotoxicity to the uh liver cells based

395
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:30,319
on the concentration that we had them uh

396
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,240
running the

397
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:36,399
sample that's my presentation uh take

398
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,400
any questions if anybody has

399
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,679
any hi thank you for that um did you

400
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:49,240
guys try to identify any unknown Peaks

401
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:53,360
using the hlc or

402
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,120
NMR we didn't uh because of the we would

403
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:59,479
need to do more uh purification uh we

404
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,798
couldn't find a lot of the I guess crms

405
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,038
uh but within the budget that we had as

406
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:04,759
well as the time that we had we just

407
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,679
wanted to take uh the samples as they

408
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:09,879
are uh directly without any modification

409
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,559
or adding in any of the other additives

410
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,840
that they add so that we can see what

411
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:16,240
the pure material is and if there's

412
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:20,199
anything added um we could potentially

413
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,919
later on take samples from uh e-commerce

414
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,679
uh with the Vapes or the carts and then

415
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,280
try to see if that makes any difference

416
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,759
but we did not unfortunately were able

417
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,759
to do that thank you

418
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:46,119
please welcome TJ Martin presenting the

419
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:50,079
chemical origins of fruity and savory

420
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:52,918
exotic cannabis Aromas oh

421
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:56,879
no acute negative reactions from

422
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:59,200
consumers were any noted uh no well

423
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,520
there has about I think it was about 2

424
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,480
years ago there was a uh FDA had a

425
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,279
report of about 20 people who had

426
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,519
adverse effect from uh Delta 8 or hhc uh

427
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,079
samples that were purchased uh they

428
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:15,158
weren't really uh fully understood why

429
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:17,678
but when they did do a uh um hplc and

430
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,600
also NMR and different uh potency tests

431
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,880
they did see aival still being in

432
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:27,000
present within the um uh the samples uh

433
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,960
and other impurities but they then those

434
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,038
people had an adverse effect in order to

435
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,880
even as severe as enough to go into

436
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,359
actually a hospital and get treatment

437
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,760
with hallucinogen uh they were throwing

438
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,038
up there was fatigue and there was a lot

439
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,158
of uh issues that came from it um I

440
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,798
don't know if it was dose dependent or

441
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,240
what it could have been caused by it but

442
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,240
we did see that when we were doing our

443
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:59,440
research uh in terms of

444
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:01,558
cytotoxicity uh it might be my opinion

445
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,038
but it shouldn't matter uh because Delta

446
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:07,759
9 delta8 the only difference is just the

447
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:09,440
um is uh it's just an isomer um but we

448
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,640
did have some samples that had Delta

449
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,558
Delta 9 in them uh we just didn't want

450
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,400
to do uh all the studies have already

451
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,000
been done with people with a from

452
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,600
Cannabis itself uh since we don't have

453
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,480
that type of license we could really do

454
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:26,439
Delta 9 directly so it's it's that

455
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,798
legality where if we tell uh HD

456
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,000
bioscience hey can you test this they

457
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,079
might not be able to do it because of

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,079
the fact that it requires a license for

459
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:37,199
them to carry Delta 9

460
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,199
compounds and

461
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:47,558
soly uh it can go both way because

462
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,038
there's nothing mixed in there these are

463
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:52,879
just pure compounds so if you look at

464
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:56,519
the potencies a lot of them are 85 to

465
00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:00,039
even higher pocy they're not 100% or 99%

466
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,558
pure so there is some little impurities

467
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:05,119
in there uh what we wanted to do was hey

468
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,359
let's take some of these uh oils that

469
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,439
are being sold as being you know just

470
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,119
pure materials and run them and see what

471
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,919
they effect of the uh compound

472
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:17,959
themselves are canabo have been known uh

473
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:20,080
to cause uh you know cytotoxicity to

474
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,000
some uh and then some of the other ones

475
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:27,519
are more uh not cytotoxic but they don't

476
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,839
attack uh you know normal cells so it's

477
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,480
this was just done so that we can show

478
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,158
hey the oils that being sold um that we

479
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,558
don't know what they're putting in there

480
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,640
in terms of when they're getting them as

481
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:40,319
a pen but the pure materials they have

482
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,320
they do have some cytotoxicity

483
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,639
associated with them um it's just yeah

484
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:48,079
we couldn't really do Delta 9 because uh

485
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,919
if you research you can see plenty of

486
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,359
papers have been done with Delta 9 as

487
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,360
being uh uh and their cytotoxicity into

488
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,359
it

489
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,990
thank you

490
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,990
[Applause]
