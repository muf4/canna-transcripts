126
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
good afternoon marion thanks for joining

127
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,758
us good afternoon ben thanks for having

128
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,679
me

129
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,680
of course uh and i'm really interested

130
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,280
to talk with you today because

131
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,120
many of our guests on the podcast we've

132
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,159
had so far and really a lot of the

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,918
presenters

134
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,439
that we have in canmed in sort of the

135
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,198
medical area

136
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,959
really speak from a clinician's

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,680
perspective you know sharing their

138
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,519
experiences and their successes

139
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,360
but the work that you're planning to

140
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,719
share at canmed is really

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,720
more focused on the patient's

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,560
perspective which i'll admit

143
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,120
unfortunately isn't a perspective we

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,079
near

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,439
we hear nearly enough at canmed so

146
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,399
that's why i'm really interested to talk

147
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,000
with you

148
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:30,159
about that um so i guess

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,600
instead of me telling you what you're

150
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,280
presenting on

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,280
i want to give you the opportunity to

152
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,279
kind of tell us and the audience

153
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,478
about the data you've collected and what

154
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,359
you'll be sharing at cam at

155
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,719

they

175
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,240
are you know using to address their

176
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
health conditions and symptoms

177
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
and then ask further about their medical

178
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,160
cannabis use

179
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,720
and uh how biomedical cannabis use has

180
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,600
impacted their life from a variety of

181
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
perspectives

182
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,039
um so we uh partnered also together with

183
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,519
umass dartmouth the study was approved

184
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,639
by

185
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:48,159
by their irb and we had about

186
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,439
an eight month uh data collection period

187
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,160
and captured data from 565 veterans

188
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,879
nationally but majority of the focus of

189
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,800
our

190
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,560
outreach and work was in massachusetts

191
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,319
so around half of our sample size is

192
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,079
from massachusetts

193
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,039
excellent and what data from this survey

194
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,800
really stood out to you or perhaps what

195
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:11,839
information is really sort of the the

196
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
take-home message

197
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,959
that the folks should know about it yeah

198
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,000
so

199
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,478
uh great question um well one of the

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,279
most

201
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,680
uh interesting things was to learn uh

202
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,399
what

203
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,199
health conditions veterans were using

204
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:30,318
medical cannabis most commonly for

205
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,439
and those out of the reported sample uh

206
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,280
38 of veterans report uh using medical

207
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,519
cannabis to address chronic pain

208
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,119
as their top health condition followed

209
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,198
by 25

210
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,560
uh reporting medical cannabis is helpful

211
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,120
for ptsd

212
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,879
and nine percent uh reporting uh their

213
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,478
top condition using medical cannabis for

214
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,400
is anxiety

215
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,240
um and so if we look at chronic pain

216
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,359
ptsd and anxiety is

217
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,960
as some of the top conditions uh we do

218
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,639
and i will present at canmed some

219
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,918
further data about

220
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,079
each of those conditions and their

221
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:06,560
medical cannabis consumption

222
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:09,680
but one of the most striking data points

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,399
that we found in this study is

224
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,160
the amount of veterans that are using

225
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,560
medical cannabis to reduce

226
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,479
unwanted over-the-counter medications or

227
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,079
prescription medications related to

228
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,439
their health conditions

229
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,079
so in fact out of our entire sample of

230
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,519
565

231
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,519
78 report using medical cannabis to

232
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,878
actively reduce the use of

233
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,799
over-the-counter or prescription

234
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,879
medications so

235
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,918
from a public health perspective when

236
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,240
you step back

237
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,240
and look at this um you know there's

238
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,360
never been a documented

239
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,159
death or lethal overdose with cannabis

240
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,639
but there has been documented um you

241
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,559
know

242
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,240
really unwanted side effects and the

243
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,759
possibility of overdose with a lot of

244
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,759
the medications that veterans are

245
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,639
commonly

246
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,039
um which i think i recently read a study

247
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,159
that

248
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:02,799
uh reviewed i don't know over 10 000

249
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,319
uh veterans uh records and found that

250
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,000
often they're prescribed

251
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,360
you know somewhere between 40 and 50

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,440
medications um

253
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,680
so the understanding the medical

254
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,320
cannabis is being reported by veterans

255
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,120
as a

256
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,560
alternative and actively trying to

257
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,080
reduce the use of

258
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:23,359
unwanted medications is pretty striking

259
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,560
wow and now are there sort of

260
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,519
barriers to veterans getting access

261
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,639
to this cannabis medicine absolutely um

262
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,039
so we ask

263
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,919
uh what are some of the major barriers

264
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,599
um

265
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,919
for accessing and actually 51 report

266
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,639
money to purchase products that they

267
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,360
want

268
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,759
41 percent lack access to the actual

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,278
right

270
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,439
products for their conditions uh 32

271
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,838
report uh they don't have the money

272
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,360
required to get a medical card

273
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,160
um followed by stigma at 30 owning a

274
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,839
firearm

275
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:03,600
at 29 and then workplace testing

276
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,000
um at 24 so um we also

277
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,680
asked you know about how much money that

278
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,919
veterans are spending right so

279
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,599
our top barriers are money to purchase

280
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,958
products access to the right products

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
which is market related

282
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,159
and then money to get a medical card um

283
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,519
when we ask how much money are you

284
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,240
spending per month

285
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
on your over-the-counter or prescription

286
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,879
medications

287
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,200
and then how much money are you spending

288
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,919
per month on medical cannabis

289
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,320
and uh nationally on average veterans

290
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,559
spend

291
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,920
98 dollars a month on out-of-pocket

292
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,278
expenses for prescription

293
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,479
over-the-counter meds

294
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,600
but they spend 343 a month on medical

295
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
cannabis

296
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,600
wow so without having you know

297
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,199
understanding that it's being used as an

298
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,040
alternative medical cannabis is not

299
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,440
covered by insurance

300
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,719
yet you know also the majority of our

301
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
veterans in our sample

302
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,399
are getting their prescriptions mailed

303
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,959
directly to them from the va

304
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,078
so you know the you know you could just

305
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,639
really tease out

306
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,439
um you know cost is a major a major

307
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,480
barrier

308
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,200
um however you know um

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,560
so there's you know examples of um i

310
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
believe in canada

311
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,278
um they're starting to provide um you

312
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,599
know free or low cost access

313
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,679
to medical cannabis for veterans and you

314
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,440
know in massachusetts stephen mandela

315
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,078
who i've worked with on the study

316
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
um and events last year he partners with

317
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,120
dispensaries to

318
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,720
um you know share this information and

319
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,839
to offer uh

320
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,879
40 off discount for 100 disabled

321
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
veterans

322
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,200
so you know the use of this information

323
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,759
um i think is really important that's

324
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,800
one of the

325
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,958
areas of of research that i'm most

326
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,000
engaged with is not only conducting

327
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,759
studies and collecting

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
data but then how do you actually use

329
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,519
that data for policy change or to

330
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,639
implement programs

331
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:54,000
or um you know

332
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,240
yeah provide access so

333
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,759
um yeah and i think the the other

334
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,799
barrier um that i

335
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,078
i think is quite interesting um

336
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,919
is the owning a firearm right

337
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,359
and because that's a federal uh

338
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,199
regulation i think

339
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,959
you know that's that's also something

340
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,680
that you know is unique to this

341
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,679
population

342
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,040
yeah that one sort of jumped out to me

343
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,439
as well because

344
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,039
i mean one would assume that veterans

345
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,040
are probably more likely to own a

346
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,679
firearm than maybe your average citizen

347
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,039
but

348
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:30,000
so what is it about um

349
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,439
about owning a firearm that makes access

350
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,839
to cannabis difficult

351
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,040
um and massachusetts i am not entirely

352
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,360
sure about other states but

353
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,078
um you know i mean you know i'm not sure

354
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,159
how enforced this is but you um

355
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,039
cannot have a firearm if you are trying

356
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,039
to get a medical card

357
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,320
yeah so

358
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
one of the um one of the other really

359
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,480
interesting findings

360
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
uh from the study was actually so we now

361
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
see that you know veterans are using

362
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,278
medical cannabis for variety of their

363
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,199
health conditions they're wanting to use

364
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,958
it as an alternative treatment

365
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
but one of the challenges specifically

366
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,599
for veterans is that you know they

367
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,679
um can access private care but they also

368
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,839
access care through the va

369
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,799
and because the va is federally funded

370
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,360
um you know va clinicians are restricted

371
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,559
um from either becoming recommenders of

372
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,839
medical cannabis

373
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,919
um you know and uh

374
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,079
you know basically don't have access to

375
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,679
a lot of high quality education around

376
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,120
where the state of the science is for

377
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,679
medical cannabis

378
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
um so and the reason i think this is

379
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,679
really important

380
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,078
is because these veterans are working to

381
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,958
you know get access to an alternative

382
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,519
treatment and

383
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,559
you know it's important for them to

384
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,440
discuss this with their healthcare

385
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,319
providers

386
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,959
um and so right now policy at the va is

387
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
that

388
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,239
um you know the clinicians and the

389
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,240
veterans are allowed to

390
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,639
um you know discuss about their medical

391
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,919
cannabis use they won't lose benefits

392
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,000
and that will be recorded in their

393
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,360
medical record but the clinician

394
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,159
isn't allowed to advise on you know

395
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,039
types dosages and et cetera et cetera um

396
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,919
or even really

397
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,439
you know engage with it so we ask um the

398
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,639
veterans in our study

399
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
you know how how many i mean uh is your

400
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,759
va doctor

401
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,600
or clinical care provider aware about

402
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,198
your medical cannabis use

403
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,839
and 60 said yes and then we ask

404
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,879
is your va doctor or health care

405
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,920
provider

406
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,879
uh supportive of your cannabis use and

407
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,599
59

408
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,559
said they don't know indicating it's not

409
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,879
this clinical

410
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,638
discussion happening right um they've

411
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,439
maybe informed the doctor

412
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,720
um but you know they're not discussing

413
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
you know they don't know if

414
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,720
their clinician approves its use um

415
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,480
so that's i think also another barrier

416
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,278
to really finding what the right dose

417
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,399
what the right

418
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:55,600
um you know products

419
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,799
um dosages etc for for veterans

420
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,800
uh for medical cannabis

421
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,838
yeah that's unfortunate and

422
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,000
unfortunately in

423
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
my other conversations with other health

424
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,879
care providers that

425
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
that's not an issue that's really

426
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,720
exclusive to veterans unfortunately

427
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,240
there's a lot of

428
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,000
there's a lot of citizens out there who

429
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,278
who feel they could benefit from medical

430
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,958
cannabis but

431
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,958
there's just so few clinicians who are

432
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,479
who are well-educated and can really

433
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,879
provide that guidance

434
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,519
um so that is certainly a challenge but

435
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,480
it was

436
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,839
encouraging to to hear you say that um

437
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,680
sort of in the absence

438
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:37,040
of the va giving benefits or

439
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,519
or giving access to medical cannabis

440
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,958
that

441
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,759
some of the dispensaries were stepping

442
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,439
up and providing discounted products

443
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,800
to them i think that's really

444
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,839
encouraging and i wonder

445
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,439
and this is probably something you've

446
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,240
already looked into but is there any

447
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,160
chance that

448
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,919
you know private doctors or one or

449
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,639
cannabis doctors

450
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,159
specifically would be willing to sort of

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,399
provide guidance to

452
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,639
this population at a discounted rate or

453
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,399
even perhaps for free

454
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,159
yeah that's uh that's a very um

455
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,600
interesting question and i think some

456
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,799
some providers out there

457
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,120
are giving us sometimes free discounts

458
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,000
for a special but you know for a short

459
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,159
period of time

460
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,440
or definitely discounted discounts for

461
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,600
medical cards

462
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,519
um we actually used the study under the

463
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,040
leadership of steve last year

464
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,039
we used the data from the study to

465
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,240
advocate for a bill in the massachusetts

466
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,360
state house

467
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,360
to mimic a program similar to what's in

468
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
illinois where

469
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,480
you know the veteran has already been

470
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,959
diagnosed with conditions by the va

471
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
and to have that paperwork used as an

472
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,758
evidence

473
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,439
that would be required to get a medical

474
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,560
card so reducing the

475
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,519
need to purchase so

476
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,679
we did introduce that use this data to

477
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,959
support that the bill did not go through

478
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,000
um this year but changes will be made

479
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,599
and

480
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,198
um you know going to try in the next

481
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,759
session um

482
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,639
but i think it's a really you know

483
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,199
important

484
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,240
aspect to have that medical cannabis

485
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,919
specialist

486
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,038
sort of guidance and help for

487
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,120
veterans um i don't know anybody that

488
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,439
is providing absolutely free ongoing

489
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,678
services um but that would be great if

490
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,720
they were

491
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,480
absolutely and i guess another thing

492
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,838
that that sort of stood out was

493
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,000
you're saying that so many of these

494
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:31,200
veterans are trying to use cannabis

495
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,919
to sort of um either replace

496
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,480
or help reduce the amount of other

497
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,679
medications that they're using but

498
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,839
the cost is being is sort of the uh

499
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,160
the barrier there so that's it just

500
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,959
seems so unfortunate that

501
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,720
um that that has to be that has to be

502
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,679
the case because i think we all could

503
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,720
agree that

504
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,759
um they would definitely benefit from uh

505
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,960
from reducing that

506
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,279
yeah um and actually i i led another

507
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
study prior to this one in 2018 that

508
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,359
looked at over

509
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,079
two thousand we had over two thousand

510
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,599
respondents it was uh open cannabis

511
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,879
consumer and patient study

512
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,639
um so general population and we found

513
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,200
very similar findings over seventy

514
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,799
percent

515
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,720
of people in that study of over two

516
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:15,519
thousand sample we're also using

517
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,120
cannabis to

518
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,839
reduce prescription over-the-counter

519
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,678
medications um and i think this is just

520
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,079
an extremely important

521
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,200
uh public health you know reality that

522
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,000
we have to look at

523
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
um you know if you're you have a legal

524
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,679
safe

525
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,480
alternative um treatment that's

526
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,559
available

527
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,640
i i think it's a public health right to

528
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,879
make sure that that's accessible

529
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,559
um but the other interesting parts in

530
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
the veterans study and in the consumer

531
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,480
study that

532
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:47,759
that we ran is that

533
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,798
they also report reducing the use of

534
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:54,319
alcohol and tobacco

535
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:56,480
much less now with the use of cannabis

536
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,839
so if you think about this it's like

537
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,038
almost a

538
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,480
harm reduction method for a variety of

539
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:06,079
substances that

540
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,519
you know are uh more lethal

541
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:12,639
um so you know it's not only medications

542
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,960
it's medications tobacco alcohol

543
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,240
um in addition to both physical and

544
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,600
psychological

545
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,400
relief so yeah and i'm glad you brought

546
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,000
up that

547
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,480
that survey because i was looking at

548
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,839
that data as well and really one of the

549
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
things that jumped out to me and it

550
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,399
seemed to be

551
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,798
almost the same percentage on the

552
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,759
veterans study too was that

553
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,558
80 of the respondents said that using

554
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,480
cannabis

555
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,399
just generally helps their quality of

556
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,200
life which

557
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,519
um and that was sort of the top response

558
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,279
for

559
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,879
you know sort of how cannabis impacts

560
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,480
their daily lives and

561
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,160
it seems to um to ring true with what

562
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,679
you just said you know if you're using

563
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
cannabis and you're just generally

564
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
feeling better that you're probably less

565
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,798
likely to

566
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,320
to be resorting to some of those

567
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,679
destructive behaviors

568
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:07,279
yep yep yeah or finding you know it's a

569
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:10,320
it's a better alternative

570
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:13,279
definitely definitely um

571
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,639
and so i wondered were there any other

572
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,960
kind of interesting

573
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,320
correlations or maybe even some

574
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,000
interesting differences sort of

575
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,960
comparing the the

576
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,880
data from the veteran survey to the sort

577
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,440
of more open study

578
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,720
yeah so the consumer and patient study

579
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,519
um

580
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,038
uh and the veterans study i think one of

581
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,759
the differences

582
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:37,200
is in the top conditions um so in the

583
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,079
veterans study

584
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,840
more veterans express you know report

585
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,439
having ptsd

586
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:47,599
um and uh so i think you know that's one

587
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,360
major difference we see similarities

588
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:55,199
in you know like we just talked about um

589
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,038
in the medication reduction um

590
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,480
you know and there's and i think you

591
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,200
know differences a little bit

592
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,038
and smoke and preferred methods and

593
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,679
preferred time of day

594
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,919
um interestingly we have you know i

595
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,038
think these populations also

596
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,080
in the veterans study we had about

597
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,480
half or over half of the respondents

598
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,399
were

599
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,919
over the age of 65. um

600
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,840
if i've got that right let me just check

601
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,960
on myself um

602
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:27,839
so uh you know that's a pretty

603
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,840
um like a substantially older population

604
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,959
versus what we had in our other studies

605
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,038
so

606
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,558
um but you know you give me the idea i

607
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,359
want to dig in further

608
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,960
and really try and um tease out those

609
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,000
differences maybe i'll write a blog and

610
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,880
i'll make sure

611
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
to send it to everybody who's listening

612
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,240
yeah that'd be great and be

613
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,798
happy to share it with the audience and

614
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,200
um if you do publish it before this

615
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,558
uh this episode goes live i'd be happy

616
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
to put it in the show notes so people

617
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,839
have a

618
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,359
quick way to get to it um one of the

619
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,399
things that stood out to me

620
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:03,519
and you sort of touched on it there um

621
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,798
was that i think this was at least

622
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,720
in the um the more open study that 54

623
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,720
of respondents said that smoking flour

624
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,679
was their primary method of consuming

625
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,200
cannabis

626
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,960
and then there was another question that

627
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,159
sort of asked for their preferred method

628
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,400
where they could select

629
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,840
multiple different ones and still

630
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,919
smoking flour was

631
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:27,199
um was the top choice at 79 percent

632
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,960
and maybe it's just because i'm more

633
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,880
in the industry and aware of all the

634
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
different types of cannabis products

635
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,960
that are out there whether it be vapes

636
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,759
or edibles or tinctures or patches

637
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,360
um that it's it's interesting to see

638
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,480
that you know smoking flour

639
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,399
is still so such a dominant um

640
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,919
preferred method and i was wondering if

641
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,440
you had any thoughts on that is that

642
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,520
sort of just because

643
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,720
it's sort of the easiest one to access

644
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,319
or the most

645
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,000
widely known one i didn't know if you

646
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,038
had any thoughts on that yeah it's a

647
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,319
really good question

648
00:22:55,038 --> 00:23:00,480
um so in both of these studies

649
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,079
um they you know we focused heavily on

650
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,038
the massachusetts market although they

651
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,279
were national

652
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,359
it was convenient sampling approach and

653
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,720
anybody nationally could take the study

654
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,879
but we did targeted outreach in

655
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,159
massachusetts and i think it might be

656
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,520
because of the nature of

657
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,200
um the industry at that time

658
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,119
and you know the availability of

659
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,240
products um

660
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,918
and not having as many now you know uh

661
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,000
that we do have now or could have in the

662
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,120
future or even the diversity of products

663
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,798
and other markets outside of

664
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,119
massachusetts i think is much greater

665
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,440
than

666
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,639
than what's available here so maybe it's

667
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,798
a factor of that

668
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,960
product availability um because we see

669
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,480
that you know access to the right

670
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,000
products was one of the barriers for the

671
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,319
veterans study

672
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,038
um so maybe they want vapes and edibles

673
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,158
and you know

674
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,480
it's too far away or only one um you

675
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,240
know

676
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,599
dispensary offers it or that kind of

677
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,720
stuff um

678
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,719
i also think it's probably also you know

679
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,038
it's just a very common you know people

680
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,679
are traditionally very used to smoking

681
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,798
flour

682
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,000
and if people are new

683
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:06,879
into cannabis now um i think it can be

684
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,400
intimidating to do some of the other

685
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,000
methods of administration you know um

686
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,919
maybe they're unfamiliar maybe needs to

687
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,359
be more patient education around that so

688
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,320
people gravitate towards you know

689
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,158
simple flower you know i know that you

690
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,278
know when i walked into the dispensary

691
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,760
the first time

692
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,400
i you know i'm a consumer i'm a patient

693
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,480
and

694
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,919
but i was intimidated to ask questions

695
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,519
and this and that you know

696
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,759
um so i think you know it's uh

697
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,960
probably accent you know availability in

698
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,960
the market

699
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,000
um awareness about how to consume those

700
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
other methods

701
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,278
uh comfortability and consuming those

702
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,559
other types

703
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,558
you know etc yeah and

704
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,639
maybe one thing that sort of struck me

705
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,399
as as you were answering there is

706
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,720
could there perhaps be a correlation

707
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,679
between the method of administration and

708
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,079
sort of the

709
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
um the symptoms that they're looking to

710
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,839
elimi alleviate

711
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,880
exactly i think that's a great point you

712
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,720
know um

713
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,640
like whether or not you're using a

714
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,200
tincture or an rso

715
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,640
or a flower i mean you know all of those

716
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
by by condition

717
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,080
i think people definitely probably if

718
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,919
they're you know very committed to

719
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,759
learning how to dial in their dosage and

720
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,360
everything that they need you know

721
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:21,119
um what's interesting too is so um

722
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,558
you know we've run these two studies the

723
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,558
open consumer and then the veterans

724
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,319
health and earlier this year

725
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,480
together with umass dartmouth launched

726
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:31,519
the coven 19

727
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,679
medical cannabis and consumer study that

728
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,440
i'm running right now

729
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,038
and so we launched that study and we

730
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,000
have several partners in

731
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,000
massachusetts and

732
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,840
really looking at the impact of coven 19

733
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:45,919
on

734
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,359
uh patients and consumers so again you

735
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,360
know what are they consuming for what

736
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,359
health condition or symptom

737
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,959
how much and how has this changed during

738
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,879
coven um

739
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,720
and i'm just trying to pull up the data

740
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,360
now but um

741
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,798
you know speaking of you know cannabis

742
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,158
consumption methods

743
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:07,599
um let's see let me

744
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:11,200
let me find it here um we did ask has

745
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,199
you know because of covid have you um

746
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,960
you know switched has your cannabis use

747
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,720
changed basically

748
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,240
uh interestingly uh that 14

749
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,400
said that they switched their preferred

750
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,319
method for consuming cannabis

751
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,000
um which i think is really really

752
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,119
interesting um and

753
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,720
47 percent stated that they consume

754
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:35,839
cannabis more now since cova 19 started

755
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,038
uh and only 11 say they consume cannabis

756
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,278
less now

757
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,839
so yeah people are consuming more

758
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:45,038
cannabis um they're also reporting

759
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,558
you know uh using cannabis uh for top

760
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,278
health conditions differently than the

761
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:48,960
other studies

762
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,720
um i think now we're living in an

763
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,519
environment of covid which is

764
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,159
heightened anxiety um also just

765
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,599
heightened

766
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,559
um risk for people who have underlying

767
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,199
health conditions

768
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,079
like medical cannabis patients um you

769
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,480
know so i think

770
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,918
you know medical cannabis patients are i

771
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,200
think should be considered a vulnerable

772
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,840
population right now

773
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,558
um within the epidemic um or the

774
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,240
pandemic

775
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,960
so um yeah i uh and they're also still

776
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000
reporting

777
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,679
in our copa 19 study uh replacing

778
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,119
the use of alcohol or prescription

779
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,399
medications

780
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,439
uh with the use of cannabis

781
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,319
wow so that's interesting um what other

782
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,720
questions

783
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,918
are you are you asking as part of this

784
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,480
this survey

785
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,759
so uh we asked how has covered 19

786
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,798
impacted your purchasing

787
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:43,119
habits um and

788
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:45,918
about 40 um report that it has

789
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,439
um one couldn't access legal

790
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,720
recreational cannabis

791
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,919
now a 14 reported now since covet they

792
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,200
purchased cannabis in the

793
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,240
illicit market our unregulated market

794
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,278
uh 12 now only order for a curbside

795
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,519
pickup

796
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,919
10 reported they got a they registered

797
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:08,158
to get a medical cannabis card

798
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:11,919
um and that's you know quite interesting

799
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,440
um the other uh questions that we ask

800
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,120
are you know the top health conditions

801
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,200
etc but what are the barriers

802
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,239
again to purchasing uh to accessing

803
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,440
cannabis

804
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,599
uh both pre and postcovid and

805
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,759
access to the right products is the top

806
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,719
barrier and that's increased since covet

807
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,640
started

808
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,880
and then money to obtain cannabis

809
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,120
products has also increased

810
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,720
since covet started um very interesting

811
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,959
uh stigma has decreased as a barrier

812
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,720
place consumed cannabis has decreased as

813
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,558
a bear

814
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,038
money required to get a medical card

815
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:50,158
decreased as a barrier

816
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,839
um and so did a lack of health care

817
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,080
provider involvement

818
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:58,319
um yeah yeah uh really interesting

819
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,000
yeah and so what does that compare to um

820
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,960
is that compared to the the study that

821
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
you did in

822
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,720
2018 or uh we asked in the survey

823
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,798
pre-covered what were your barriers and

824
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,519
what are your barriers

825
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,879
interesting yeah yeah and to rate their

826
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,918
top barriers

827
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,320
um very interesting um we also asked

828
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,840
about

829
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,359
covid infection um eight percent

830
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,879
of the respondents reported they were

831
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,158
infected with covet and received the

832
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,120
results

833
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,919
11 uh respondents i think they have

834
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,719
covid but they can't access a test

835
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,559
and 13 report they have current symptoms

836
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,278
of coping

837
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,240
so all of this is very interesting um

838
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,038
because of the

839
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,960
emerging evidence around cannabis cbd

840
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,079
terpenes cannabinoid profiles that are

841
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,319
coming out right now

842
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,879
um from a variety of research

843
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:52,319
institutions related to the impact of

844
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,559
cannabis on covent right by interrupting

845
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,200
the cytokine storm at the

846
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,879
end stage or you know different

847
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,480
researchers are looking at

848
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,120
uh either thc or cbd or a combination of

849
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,440
different

850
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,639
again cannabinoids and terpenes and how

851
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,320
they may actually

852
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,520
be a possible prevention measure

853
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,839
um so it's quite interesting uh

854
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,200
data that's coming out of you know

855
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,240
israel and canada

856
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,960
and south carolina and georgia

857
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,480
and other other universities um

858
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,519
university of miami

859
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,159
um so as part of this study we've

860
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,359
actually

861
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,960
i'm organizing an event to be held

862
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,158
in december around covet and cannabis

863
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,960
and where is the research

864
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,039
and standing at that point and then also

865
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:45,120
from a clinical perspective

866
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:47,440
to really lead an engaging virtual event

867
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,879
that will i've invited several several

868
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,558
of these researchers to present some of

869
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,559
their preliminary findings

870
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,119
uh some clinicians and then we'll have a

871
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,798
nice uh discussion at the end about

872
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,479
the state of the evidence around this

873
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:03,918
and and kind of what's what's the latest

874
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,200
that sounds excellent and i don't want

875
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,919
to invite ourselves but

876
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,558
i know that some of the uh the folks on

877
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,679
our team

878
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:14,079
here have uh been looking into

879
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,919
to covet and cannabis more on the

880
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,960
testing side to to make sure that we

881
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,640
have sort of a

882
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,679
testing assay to

883
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,519
measure if there's any any covid on

884
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,840
cannabis products

885
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,000
to sort of protect consumer safety

886
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,519
i will i will say we've seen no evidence

887
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,319
of that in the marketplace that that's

888
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,798
out there

889
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,158
um and the main reason that our cso

890
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,918
kevin mckernan felt it

891
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,960
important to uh to create this test was

892
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,080
more so because um one of one of the

893
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,679
encouraging signs

894
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:53,038
of the pandemic was that in many states

895
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,519
um they deemed cannabis to be

896
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,038
essential which i think we can all agree

897
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,359
was the right move to make but

898
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,480
one of the concerns that we had here was

899
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,038
that if

900
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,519
for whatever reason there ever was covet

901
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:05,679
found

902
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,200
on cannabis that would completely shut

903
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,200
down the supply chain

904
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,960
and you know so many of these patients

905
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,640
wouldn't have access to their medicine

906
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,919
so in order to prevent that we wanted to

907
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,120
make sure that there was a test

908
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,278
available that

909
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,719
should should that become an issue that

910
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,880
the testing labs could run

911
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,000
to make sure that you know medical

912
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,720
cannabis is still

913
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,278
is still functioning so thankfully we

914
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,558
had

915
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,480
thankfully there really hasn't been a

916
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,759
need for that but it's something that we

917
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,798
felt very strongly about

918
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,319
and um like i said i know that

919
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,240
if you gave him the chance that kevin

920
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,879
would be more than happy to

921
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,079
uh to take part in your event yeah i

922
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,799
would love it i think that's really

923
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,960
interesting

924
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,558
um and i you know thank you all for that

925
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,399
because that would have been a disaster

926
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,079
to say you know i could have really shut

927
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,639
down uh

928
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,839
oh yeah and put you know patience at

929
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,679
risk so

930
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,439
thank you guys for leading that work and

931
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,519
definitely i would love kevin to be part

932
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,278
of this event

933
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,919
yeah and speaking of sort of um

934
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,599
maybe there being a band that that took

935
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,278
medicine away from patients i know that

936
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,639
when i was doing my research on

937
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,640
on the many things that you're involved

938
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,759
in that you were involved in sort of

939
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,799
advocating

940
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,960
here in massachusetts to lift the vape

941
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,720
ban that had been uh that had been

942
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,120
implemented after

943
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,200
um there was that the vape scare where a

944
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,879
lot of people were getting sick there

945
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,240
so i was wondering if if you'd like to

946
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,360
speak a bit about that since

947
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,359
it seems like a nice segue yeah yeah so

948
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:36,839
um last year uh there was sweeping cases

949
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,319
of a valley um going across the united

950
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,000
states um

951
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:44,798
so the you know sort of uh issues around

952
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,319
um potentially contaminated products or

953
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:47,599
really just a lack of understanding

954
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,119
about what was causing

955
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,000
a valley um and governor baker took very

956
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,000
swift action

957
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,038
to ban vapes in massachusetts

958
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,119
um i had looked at this issue

959
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,879
in terms of i just scientifically

960
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,079
started look from an epidemiological

961
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,440
perspective

962
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,119
where were the cases where they be

963
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,440
reporting you know is this coming from

964
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,559
tobacco vapes versus coming from

965
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,720
uh thc vapes um and just trying to

966
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,918
start to dig into whatever i could find

967
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,039
online

968
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:22,000
um and really you know uh at that time

969
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,639
also very quickly uh mcr labs put

970
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,639
together the vitamin e acetate test

971
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,159
um to start testing products so we

972
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,519
actually work together on the

973
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,358
um you know trying to figure out the

974
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,639
science of this um from the different

975
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,000
perspectives

976
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,399
um so they they put together um that

977
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,559
i started to look into you know like i

978
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,159
said what be my potential causes

979
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,759
i actually reached out to my father as

980
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,599
well he's an international infectious

981
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,800
disease epidemiologist

982
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,679
um and you know i thought it was

983
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,399
uh a little premature for to have such

984
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,119
swift

985
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,480
action uh without a little bit more

986
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,519
further testing which only took a little

987
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,519
bit of time to do

988
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:01,759
but it really hurt the industry and

989
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,800
really hurt medical patients that

990
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,359
rely on vapes um so

991
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,160
um yeah we put together a press

992
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,279
conference

993
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,319
um around this uh invited dr peter

994
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,200
grinspoon

995
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,640
commissioner title different experts to

996
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,598
give their opinions on

997
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,960
on the vape ban um and so that we've got

998
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,000
that recording

999
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,760
um and then um yeah did advocacy around

1000
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,559
that they eventually lifted it

1001
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,800
um and then you know now since we

1002
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,400
understand that um

1003
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,599
massachusetts um you know i think it was

1004
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,240
a premature

1005
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,160
uh intervention um some studies that

1006
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,879
have come out later have have documented

1007
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,239
that it had

1008
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,920
really no impact on valley cases

1009
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:49,118
so i think i was yeah that was a that

1010
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,639
was an interesting time and an

1011
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,079
interesting time for the industry and i

1012
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,039
think it took a really big hit

1013
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,680
for patient access um and just for the

1014
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,559
industry at large

1015
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:01,519
yeah and again just another example of

1016
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,440
how

1017
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,280
sort of the knee-jerk reaction can be

1018
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,960
just to ban

1019
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,640
and um how you know that

1020
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,000
unfortunately is sort of a blunt

1021
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,719
instrument that's not always the best

1022
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,960
one to use and as you demonstrated

1023
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,759
having good testing techniques

1024
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,440
to ensure patient safety um is really

1025
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,960
the way to go rather than just kind of

1026
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,880
do a wholesale ban

1027
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,960
so thank you for your your work on that

1028
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,440
yeah absolutely um we

1029
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,358
ran a quick survey of that as well

1030
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,240
because you know me and studies

1031
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,639
um and you know we did find that i mean

1032
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,319
people

1033
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,159
when they're when they don't have access

1034
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,599
to things you know they're and you can't

1035
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:41,838
just cut them off with a ban

1036
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,440
you know what i mean um so people did

1037
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,279
they'll start searching

1038
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,039
products on the unregulated market that

1039
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,000
are not tested and that are not

1040
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,960
necessarily

1041
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,320
fully safe uh driving across borders to

1042
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,199
get things you know

1043
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,200
um saw that also probably when when

1044
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,559
adult use was deemed non-essential in

1045
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,000
massachusetts

1046
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:04,239
um with coving um right you know

1047
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,838
so i mean in our study you know people

1048
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,598
like we said

1049
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,358
i said that you know some people now

1050
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,119
since code had to

1051
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,039
seek their products on the unregulated

1052
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,358
market i'm gonna look at that over time

1053
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,759
since i'm gonna look at the timestamp of

1054
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,679
when adult use was banned in

1055
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,160
massachusetts and that data versus now

1056
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,559
when it's

1057
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,239
uh back open and see if those numbers

1058
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,400
change but

1059
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,000
yeah that'll be interesting to see yeah

1060
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,838
yeah

1061
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,838
so i know we're getting towards the end

1062
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,199
here and i did want to give you an

1063
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:34,559
opportunity that i know

1064
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,039
in addition to the work that you're

1065
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:39,519
doing in terms of

1066
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,719
doing surveys and sort of larger scale

1067
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,880
studies

1068
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,199
that you also do a lot of work in terms

1069
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,838
of advocacy and social justice so i

1070
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,439
wanted to

1071
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,358
kind of get an update and see if there's

1072
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,320
any any new things that you're working

1073
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:51,119
on that you like to share with the

1074
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,280

the students

1112
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,000
um basically asking opinions about

1113
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,320
legalization

1114
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,280

state

1116

and the students will be analyzing this

1117
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,440
data and producing a report

1118
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,400
um that would provide recommendations

1119
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,039
for

1120
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,320
future commissions or advocates or

1121
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,239
others in the state

1122
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,440
around those topics of legalization and

1123
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,078
social justice

1124
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,039
uh so we're trying to make this a very

1125
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,119
actionable

1126
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,039
uh study uh it's very quick data

1127
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,358
collection so before november third

1128
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,800

take the survey and um we'll be having a

1131
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,679
virtual event

1132
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,358
um on december 2 at 3 p.m where the

1133
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,399
students will present the findings

1134
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,920
and we'll have various um advocates and

1135
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,200
experts from new jersey also

1136
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,838
participating in the virtual event

1137
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,439
wow that's great um and if you send over

1138
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,199
the links i'd be happy to put that in

1139
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,000
the show notes so people can quickly get

1140
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,559
to that

1141
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,039
um if they're able to take the survey or

1142
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,679
definitely

1143
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,400
sign up for that event and i think

1144
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:10,559
that's

1145
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,000
a very appropriate you looking into new

1146
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:12,400
jersey because i know that a lot of

1147
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,480
folks

1148
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,559
in the industry here especially us on

1149
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,800
the east coast are very interested

1150
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,838
to see what happens in new jersey it

1151
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,800
would be

1152
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,519
only the second state in the northeast

1153
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,880
to really go

1154
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,920
full adult use and i think the general

1155
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,119
consensus is

1156
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,559
if if new jersey goes legal pretty much

1157
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,880
everyone else is going to follow so that

1158
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,400
is

1159
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,920
definitely going to be a big vote that

1160
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,280
we're all paying attention to in

1161
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,358
november as a

1162
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,359
in addition to another pretty big one

1163
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:45,358
that's going to be happening in november

1164
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:47,679
um so i guess just finishing up here i

1165
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,598
did want to give you a chance to

1166
