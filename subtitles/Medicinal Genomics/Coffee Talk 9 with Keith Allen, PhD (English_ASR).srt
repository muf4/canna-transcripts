20
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,519
the news is that our team has made the

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,480
difficult decision to postpone this

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,040
year's event

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:09,759
to the spring of next year can med 2021

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,080
will take place april 12th through 14th

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,240
at the pasadena convention center in

26
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,759
pasadena california

27
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,759
if you're a faithful listener of the

28
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,319
podcast you have heard me say that we

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,319
were closely monitoring the covid19

30
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,319
situation in california

31
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,639
and working with the pasadena convention

32
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,519
center and local leaders to make sure we

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,680
can provide a

34
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,118
safe environment for our staff and

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,600
attendees

36
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,159
our team felt moving the event to april

37
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,959
2021 would be the best way for us to

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,920
provide

39
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,919
a safe environment for everyone we are

let me tell you about today's guest

67
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,318
keith allen

68
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,359
keith is the director of bioinformatics

69
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,919
at front range

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,319
biosciences where he is tasked with

71
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,518
exploring the cannabis genome to find

72
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,199
genetic markers

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,759
that can be selected in breeding

74
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,878
projects his current focus

75
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,280
is on cannabinoid and terpene production

76
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,199
but as we discuss in our conversation

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
there are a number of different traits

78
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,199
cannabis and hemp breeders

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,560
will want to select for in the future

80
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,199
including yield

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,479
drought resistance pathogen resistance

82
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,479
flowering time

83
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,840
hardiness for the outdoor environment

84
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,679
and more

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,878
the opportunity for improving the

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
cannabis and hemp

87
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,878
plant is only restricted by our

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,519
understanding of the genome

89
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,280
which keith readily admits is still in

90
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,200
its infancy

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
keith will be presenting on gene

92
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,359
families and gene networks

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,560
underlying oil production and cannabis

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,840

for joining us today

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,000
good afternoon no problem excellent um

00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,719
and thank you so

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720
much for agreeing to be a part of can

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,880
med 2020 i know the team here

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,479
at medicinal genomics has been an

136
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,159
admirer of your work for

137
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,719
for quite a few years so we're really

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,720
excited to have you presenting this year

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,600
yeah i'm excited to be a part of it this

140
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,520
has been on my radar for a while

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,520
now have you ever have you ever attended

142
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,599
canfed before would this be your first

143
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,879
this will be my first excellent

144
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
excellent and

145
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,478
we already have you secured in a

146
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,879
speaking slot i was wondering if you

147
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,800
could talk a little bit about

148
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,639
what you're intending to present to

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,478
everyone

150
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,600
so what i'm going to be talking about

151
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:56,159
started out as being about gene

152
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,680
networks underlying oil profile

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,160
and cannabis trichomes and it turns out

154
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,000
i got a little bit distracted on the way

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,840
to getting there

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,279
and so what i'm going to talk about is

157
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,279
really the gene

158
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,119
families so before i could get to

159
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,799
networks of genes i need to understand

160
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,840
what the genes are

161
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,199
and i ran into some kind of

162
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:22,239
a lot more complexity and a lot more

163
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,560
interesting detail in terms of

164
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,240
what's going on under the hood in terms

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,800
of the way

166
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,840
trichomes are organizing the work that

167
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,319
they're doing

168
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,079
creating all of these compounds that you

169
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,800
know make that make the plant so uh

170
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,680
so interesting so when you say you were

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,280
originally going to

172
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
talk about gene networks and now talking

173
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,599
about gene families

174
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,120
what's the difference so gene networks

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,520
you're talking about the way

176
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,038
genes interact with each other either in

177
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,598
a regulatory

178
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,519
system you've got you know genes are

179
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,598
responsible transcription factors for

180
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,399
example that are responsible for turning

181
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,399
on

182
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:03,839
a particular set of genes or you've got

183
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,239
other genes that that regulate

184
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,839
what's going on in different ways either

185
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,240
by turning something up or

186
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,758
destroying it or whatever so that's one

187
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,960
kind of gene network

188
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,639
the other kind of gene network is um

189
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:20,560
a biosynthetic network cannabinoids are

190
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,199
pretty big molecules

191
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,439
and the way cells handling making a

192
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,759
molecule like that is by assembling it

193
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,879
from

194
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,038
smaller parts very standard parts

195
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,399
that it just makes a part of what we

196
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,399
call core metabolism

197
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,079
so there's a there's a sequence as a

198
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,719
pathway of genes

199
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,639
that's involved in taking these very

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,160
standard plugged together

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,840
parts and building very very specific um

202
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,520
large molecules like like the

203
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,239
cannabinoids

204
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,198
it's almost like an assembly line it is

205
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,560
a bit like a

206
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,080
like an assembly line only this one

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,000
this one every step is robotic but there

208
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,240
seems to be about five different robots

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,079
that

210
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,918
could be working each step and we don't

211
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,959
know that all the robots are the same or

212
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,959
have the same priorities

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,879
okay so that's gene network so what's a

214
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,000
gene family

215
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,800
so a gene family you take a particular

216
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,879
kind well

217
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,120
so here's a great example the

218
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,039
cannabinoid synthases

219
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,199
are members of a large and very

220
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,680
evolutionarily

221
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,240
ancient gene family called the berberine

222
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,280
bridge

223
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,079
enzymes they're we call them a family

224
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,120
because

225
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:36,399
it's clear that there was way back

226
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,519
in the deep past before the fungi

227
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,719
split off from the plants there was an

228
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,240
enzyme

229
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,560
and all of these enzymes

230
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,639
and they've diversified now to do a lot

231
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,799
of different things but they're all

232
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,879
related in terms of their history their

233
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,919
lineage back to this original

234
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:59,600
uh this original enzyme so in

235
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:02,719
cannabis the berberine bridge family

236
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,959
contains on the order of about 20 genes

237
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,040
that we would recognize as cannabinoid

238
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,719
synthases or

239
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,319
you know very very likely to be

240
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
cannabinoid synthesis

241
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
and then there's a bunch more of these

242
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,039
enzymes some which are

243
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,199
pretty well expressed in trichomes that

244
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,439
we don't know what they do all we know

245
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,278
is that it's probably a fairly you know

246
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,640
a molecule that's in the range of the

247
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,720
same size um

248
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:30,080
as as a cannabinoid so that would be an

249
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,560
example of a gene family

250
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,519
it's fascinating and one of the things i

251
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,119
hear so much in

252
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,799
in talking to kevin here medicinal

253
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,600
genomics and other folks are kind of in

254
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,799
this

255
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,560
in this space is we don't know how much

256
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,958
how much do we know about the cannabis

257
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,958
genome

258
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,759
not very much every time

259
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,479
every time you know i peel back a layer

260
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,600
of the onion

261
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,879
it's like you know i mean it's it's a

262
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
little bit like one of those

263
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,559
those russian doll things except instead

264
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,039
of taking it off and there's a smaller

265
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,119
doll

266
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,319
inside you take it off and there's 50

267
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
smaller dolls

268
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,839
and they're all a little bit different

269
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,240
from each other so everything about

270
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,560
this genome is unlike

271
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
other genomes i've worked with i've

272
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,799
slowed down a little bit i'm thinking

273
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,958
about the maze genome it's is

274
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,000
maybe maybe close to the same level of

275
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,439
crazy

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,720
but basically

277
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
this has been a very an intensely

278
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,800
neglected

279
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
crop for a very long time so you compare

280
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,159
what we know about

281
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,839
the cannabis genome to what we know

282
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,199
about you know tomato

283
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:45,040
corn corn soybean you know

284
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,278
for pizza sweet potato um where there's

285
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,559
you know entire academic careers have

286
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,480
been sunk into

287
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,239
studying you know these other crops and

288
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,519
you come over to cannabis

289
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,480
and you're really really

290
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,078
starting with you know stone knives and

291
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,240
bear claws in terms of

292
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:07,838
the amount that we know we do have

293
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,879
various genomes that are finished

294
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,240
to various rates of quality we do

295
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,958
have an initial run at

296
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,039
um at annotating these genomes which is

297
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,919
basically just going through and saying

298
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,559
here's a gene here's a repeat element

299
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,559
and whatnot

300
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,120
and we're just at the beginning of

301
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,959
starting to get

302
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,480
a sense for

303
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,359
how much the genome varies from plant to

304
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,278
plant

305
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,959
from cult or article to our within

306
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:46,240
cannabis um and

307
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:50,319
and this is really my focus getting into

308
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,519
specific gene families like you know the

309
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,320
um the family of genes that um

310
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,639
create the early precursors in the

311
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,040
pathway to the to the cannabinoids or

312
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,799
the terpene synthesis

313
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,958
for example how much variation do we see

314
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,919
in these from cultivar to cultivar in

315
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,638
terms of

316
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,439
just whole blocks of these genes being

317
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,320
missing and we're seeing that

318
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
you know new ones we haven't seen you

319
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,959
know

320
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,958
showing up as we as we as we sequence

321
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,319
new cultivars

322
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:27,278
and also changes within the genes

323
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,920
themselves you know i can reliably say

324
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,278
you know

325
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,399
this is the you know the thc synthase or

326
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,439
or whatever

327
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,159
but every plant i look at the gene is

328
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,519
just a little bit different

329
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:44,639
so the the amount of variation

330
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,799
in this genome particularly

331
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,720
within the parts of the genome that are

332
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,838
relevant to the kind of breeding we want

333
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,240
to do

334
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,959
um amount of variation is amazing

335
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,159
uh that much we know right now so on the

336
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,838
one hand

337
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,278
from the standpoint of trying to study

338
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,320
this genome

339
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,078
um it's frustrating because it's i

340
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,320
you know i can't just write a simple

341
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,359
document that says the cannabis genome

342
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
is this

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,159
um on the other hand

344
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
it's really exciting because every time

345
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,439
you turn around there's there's

346
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,560
something new

347
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,959
and probably most importantly

348
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,599
from a breeding standpoint breeding is

349
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,559
about

350
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,320
making you're mixing up you have you

351
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,159
have this line and this line and this

352
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,360
one has these characteristics you like

353
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,519
and this one has

354
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
these other characteristics you like you

355
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,519
want to create

356
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,479
a stable hybrid between them that has

357
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,039
all the things

358
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,879
that you want so it's about making

359
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,519
combinations of different genetic

360
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,679
elements

361
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,120
so if you take a step back and look at

362
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,159
this variation

363
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,198
rate thing it means the number of

364
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,360
potential

365
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,198
combinations or another way to look at

366
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,639
that is the number of possible breeding

367
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,919
targets

368
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:03,198
that we can we can get to with this

369
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,120
with this plant is incredible

370
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,240
if you compare that to something like

371
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
soybean

372
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
where the amount of genetic variation

373
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,799
within

374
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:15,759
you know the breeding stock that we we

375
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:19,439
have available to us

376
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,439
extremely limited um

377
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,040
what you can do with that genome because

378
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,880
it's just very little it's a very what

379
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,919
we call a bottlenecked

380
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:31,278
uh genetic population

381
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:35,039
cannabis is absolutely the opposite

382
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,078
extreme and let's see to actually answer

383
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,439
your question

384
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,719
we are just at the beginning of

385
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,839
understanding how much variation happens

386
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,959
wow that's fascinating so and so how

387
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,360
much of that

388
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,278
genetic variation in cannabis is just

389
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,720
because it has been sort of

390
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,240
on the fringes and hasn't had as much

391
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,959
intense study as say

392
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
a soybean or is it is it something that

393
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,159
was always part of the plan

394
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,519
or is it kind of due to circumstance

395
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,879
so um that's

396
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,679
kind of really not surprising that's

397
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:13,919
kind of a complex question

398
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:16,879
one of the things um so if you look at

399
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,679
corn for example there's an ancestral

400
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,799
species

401
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:23,359
called teosinte and

402
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,479
teosinte actually still exists you can

403
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,240
grow this stuff you wouldn't be able to

404
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
there's a way to eat it that has to do

405
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,360
with like soaking in lie

406
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,839
stuff like that you know but there was a

407
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,320
set

408
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,959
of like a half a dozen mutations that

409
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
happened in

410
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,479
tiacente that turned it into something

411
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,519
kind of looked like

412
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
you know modern field corn um

413
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,198
and so then we've been breeding on that

414
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,239
all these years and you

415
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,120
drive across iowa and boy i'm here to

416
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
tell you

417
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
modern what we're growing in iowa right

418
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,480
now it doesn't look

419
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,720
anything like what what you know the

420
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,920
inca and maya civilizations

421
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,320
um discovered yeah yeah what is that on

422
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,838
the

423
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,120
range of a thousand years um ago

424
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,320
so that's an example where we've got

425
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
the product of you know a millennium of

426
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,160
selection

427
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,198
and and now targeted breeding

428
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:22,639
and we've got the wild relative in

429
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:26,799
cannabis it seems like all we have

430
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,440
is you know we don't have

431
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,039
really really good what you would call

432
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,440
land races or

433
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,599
or or wild relatives that everybody

434
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,720
agrees yeah this is what it looked like

435
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,959
before

436
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,480
human selection everything i mean we

437
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,919
have been doing selection

438
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,039
in this in this uh species really

439
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:50,399
since the egyptians you know so it's a

440
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,039
very very large number of

441
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,919
generations uh plant generations have

442
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,599
taken place

443
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:59,120
while we've been selecting on this so

444
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,399
we've got kind of this crazy

445
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,679
mismatch of you know we've been

446
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:09,279
selecting on this genome and

447
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,880
and you know we we we end up with

448
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,000
something that is basically kind of a

449
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,919
ways from

450
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,759
from you know what the natural genome

451
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
would look like the other thing that's

452
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,558
going

453
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,160
on is there's been a lot of

454
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,399
you know it wasn't random in terms of

455
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,240
what you know individual breeders were

456
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,160
doing but if you kind of like back

457
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,519
up and look at the whole effect it's

458
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,240
essentially kind of like

459
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,319
random all of this mixing of you know

460
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,440
southeast asian strains and you know

461
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,960
it's strange found

462
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,919
found from various places around the

463
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,400
world to create new varieties

464
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,240
so we have that aspect of it as well is

465
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,759
that there's

466
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,440
basically everything you pick up right

467
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,798
now is

468
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,840
a hybrid meaning you know it's

469
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:56,079
this is a diploid organism means it's

470
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:59,678
got two copies of the chromosome

471
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:02,720
and those two copies are very

472
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,280
dissimilar um to each other

473
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
so if you i try to you know like breed

474
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,759
this thing

475
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,038
you know in my f1 population all the

476
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,279
seeds are going to be different

477
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,279
so that's another aspect where we're

478
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,720
very far behind

479
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:23,759
you know the species where

480
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,480
you know i mean corn we

481
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,000
i don't know how long missouri 17 and

482
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,720
you know

483
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,519
these these old inbreds that have been

484
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,038
reliable

485
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:38,079
and understood and studied for

486
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,558
50 years and we're kind of away from

487
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,199
that

488
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,038
in cannabis right but i would think the

489
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,319
potential to

490
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,679
to breed a new and interesting strain of

491
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,519
corn

492
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,840
that's got to be pretty hard to do

493
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:56,480
correct

494
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:58,000
it it is to get to um uh

495
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,079
to get to something that's really

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,558
fundamentally different i mean what

497
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,399
what modern breeding and corn is doing

498
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,918
so it's it's moving to

499
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,080
very much more sophisticated

500
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,559
mathematical models for looking at the

501
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,759
inter at the relationship between

502
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:17,200
observable genetic markers and

503
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:20,319
output traits um but basically

504
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
we're on this this part of the curve

505
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,079
right now

506
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,400
where uh for corn we're increasing your

507
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,439
yield by about one and a half percent

508
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
a year well you know it still looks like

509
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,558
the same plant

510
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,840
but one and a half percent more than you

511
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,359
got last year

512
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:40,480
and that's been a very reliable um

513
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,918
trend at about that rate since about

514
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,240
1950

515
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,799
or so we don't know we're going to hit

516
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,720
this guy would be a theoretical maximum

517
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:53,918
someplace but cannabis

518
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,319
will be very different um from that

519
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,038
because

520
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,159
we're really we're just so early in

521
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,200
breeding we don't

522
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,558
know you know

523
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,440
there could be we could flail around

524
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,960
and and fail to find you know much

525
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,400
that's particularly useful

526
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,558
i don't think that's going to be the

527
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,000
outcome on on the other hand at the

528
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,918
other extreme

529
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,720
we could end up really hitting pay dirt

530
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,038
on

531
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,079
some new combinations that we haven't

532
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,599
you know we

533
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,599
we haven't known to try yet

534
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:35,360
so it's maze breeding

535
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,000
is in many ways boring and reliable

536
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,879
it's you know general motors it's just

537
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,720
kind of

538
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,280
plugging along cannabis breeding is

539
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,079
going to be

540
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,079
a lot more

541
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,399
exciting in terms of what are the kinds

542
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,480
of things that

543
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
that that we get out of it i guess the

544
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,519
other thing to say there

545
00:20:53,599 --> 00:21:00,000
is that in maze um

546
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,599
there's there's two main traits that

547
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
that all the big breeding companies are

548
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,839
they are

549
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,159
are focused on right now one is yield

550
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,359
period and the second is drought

551
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,280
tolerance or

552
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:16,158
yield under under drought um

553
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,038
nitrogen use efficiency or uptake

554
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
efficiency is

555
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,200
is another one that's for further down

556
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,919
on the list

557
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,919
you move over to cannabis and

558
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
you know yield is going to be really

559
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,159
important

560
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:36,079
but it's a it's a very complicated trait

561
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,840
um to breed with drought tolerance is

562
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:41,439
going to be important

563
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,879
but i think that in the short term

564
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,200
the kinds of things we're going to be

565
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,080
looking at is creating

566
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,720
stable reliable lines that give you a

567
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:54,639
very specific oil profile

568
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,120
under a given growth regime

569
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,080
that's what the market is the most

570
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,519
looking for

571
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:06,000
um right now the end user

572
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:08,000
market and that's also going to be

573
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,359
what i i think we're going to be best

574
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,400
position

575
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:16,000
to be able to to to breed for um

576
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,120
in in the short term so you're saying a

577
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,038
consistent cannabinoid terpene profile

578
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,158
um from generation to generation that's

579
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,519
sort of the first

580
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,200
hill to to tackle yeah that's that's the

581
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,519
first one that we're going to be able to

582
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,960
go

583
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,960
after now if you talk to

584
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,319
growers i mean there's a lot of growers

585
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,759
out there who say man

586
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:40,399
i've got i got this one variety and

587
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,440
i can sell every gram of the stuff that

588
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
i can grow

589
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,360
and i can sell it a big premium but i

590
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,559
can't afford to grow it because yield

591
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:52,240
the overall yield is so low you know

592
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:55,918
what can be done um about this and

593
00:22:52,240 --> 00:23:01,200
there will be things to do there but

594
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:03,600
any time you you know so overall yield

595
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,558
we don't even know how many genes are

596
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,399
involved in that

597
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:12,158
and so it's it's much more

598
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,559
complicated to design a breeding program

599
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,480
that you know and it may be the you know

600
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,480
it's probably going to end up modeled

601
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,880
very closely on on what's currently be

602
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,079
done been done in mays

603
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
and it'll just be gradual incremental

604
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,798
increases in yield

605
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,319
um year by year yeah i mean and that's

606
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,038
fascinating when you said that

607
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,519
you know corn yield is increasing by one

608
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,960
percent

609
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:39,519
a year and has been since 1950 so yeah

610
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,038
i can only imagine you know 70 years

611
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,079
from now what cannabis is going to look

612
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:51,839
like

613
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:51,839
yeah yes

614
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:03,119
it's fascinating so

615
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,640
in terms of cannabinoids in terpenes i

616
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,519
got to imagine that's

617
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,799
intensely complicated as well just

618
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,679
because

619
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,519
i mean modern testing labs can't even

620
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,038
test for all the terpenes that the

621
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:20,158
the plant is creating so

622
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,158
so where do you start there

623
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:30,879
um so

624
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:34,319
the the terpenes are very difficult

625
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,600
for a number of reasons you know as

626
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:40,639
as a breeding target as a you know

627
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,158
anyway you want to want to go at it um

628
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,159
one of the big challenges with the

629
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,039
terpenes is

630
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,600
they're volatile i mean they just they

631
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,960
just

632
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:53,199
you know evaporate and you know if

633
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,880
if if you take your you know you you got

634
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,319
a whole bunch of fresh bud

635
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,960
and your curing protocol is to put it in

636
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,038
basically a low temperature oven for a

637
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,759
day or two and just drive all the water

638
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:05,278
out

639
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,679
it's gonna be nice and dry and you're

640
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,919
gonna lose almost all

641
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,440
you know of your terpenes out of there

642
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,600
if you so

643
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,960
there's all these variable variables

644
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,240
before your sample

645
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,600
even gets to the extraction step in your

646
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,720
testing lab

647
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,798
um that impact

648
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,278
you know at the terpenes they all boil

649
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,038
at different at different points

650
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,558
you know the monoterpenes are boiling in

651
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,798
the like 150 degrees celsius range but

652
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,759
the sesquiterpenes are larger and you're

653
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,079
more like 225 or so but they all

654
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,119
but what that means is different

655
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,278
molecules

656
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,599
are being depleted out of your sample at

657
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,159
different rates

658
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,879
so you know if you're looking at the

659
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,360
ratio

660
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,520
between the ratio of mercene to

661
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,278
caryophyllene for example

662
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,720
it's going to change depending on how

663
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:00,798
you cure the plant

664
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:04,960
and how old the sample is

665
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:06,720
so it's kind of a nightmare scenario for

666
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,840
a breeding program

667
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,000
where you would need to be going in and

668
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,439
periodically

669
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,640
checking do i have exactly the terping

670
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,519
you know profile that i want um it's

671
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,720
just

672
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:24,079
it's inherently difficult just because

673
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,960
you know this this kind of experimental

674
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,480
variability

675
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,960
is is both built in the other aspect of

676
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,599
this

677
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,759
is that um this is a particular area of

678
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,480
chromatography where you've got very

679
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,038
complicated mixes people are dealing

680
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,839
with

681
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,960
different matrices that you know they

682
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,480
have to you know do

683
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,919
do the extraction from um

684
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:54,079
and it's there's a lot of stuff that

685
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:58,159
that makes it difficult to do

686
00:26:54,079 --> 00:27:00,240
to do these measurements really well um

687
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,440
you know steep hills seem to do a

688
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,440
particularly good job of it but

689
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,480
you know your mileage is going to vary

690
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,640
because this stuff is

691
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,679
not easy and we haven't standardized

692
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,720
to like a global set of

693
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,640
best practices um that everybody would

694
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,519
adhere to

695
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,120
yeah absolutely um when i when i speak

696
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,960
with with folks in the

697
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,558
lab testing side which is one of the

698
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,919
focus areas of canmed

699
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,839
that's one of the things they come back

700
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,320
to all the time is the need for

701
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,278
a standard to sort of get consistent

702
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,839
results from lab to lab so

703
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,519
hopefully hopefully we'll see that soon

704
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,359
yeah

705
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:42,879
um one of the things you sort of touched

706
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,079
on and it's not

707
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,000
an exact correlation but i did want to

708
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,599
bring up to you this whole idea of

709
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
nature versus nurture

710
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,359
as well where you know the genes are

711
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,079
only going to do

712
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,678
so much it it a lot's going to depend on

713
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,519
the environment you place it in the type

714
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,200
of lights that you're providing

715
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,720
so i'm wondering if you could comment a

716
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,640
bit on that and is there

717
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,640
sort of is there variation even between

718
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,440
strains where some are more sensitive to

719
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,360
sort of those

720
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,360
changes or is it universal

721
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:20,158
a little bit of all of those of course

722
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,119
yeah so for for a given genetic

723
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,039
background

724
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:27,278
you have you grow up this stuff and

725
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,398
you know either it's completely

726
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:30,398
genetically pure

727
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:31,678
well we don't have that so you know you

728
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,959
do cuttings

729
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,200
um we already know you know so you do

730
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,600
and

731
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
you grow them indoors and outdoors you

732
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,079
grow them under

733
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,240
you know high pressure sodium and you

734
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,678
know you know

735
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,880
led light you grow them outdoors in

736
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,278
five different fields or you walk a

737
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,960
field outdoors and just look at

738
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,119
if you've got a lot of variation in the

739
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,159
field and

740
00:28:55,119 --> 00:29:01,199
most of the time when i'm out in a field

741
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,000
it's rare to find a field that is really

742
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,080
100 homogeneous in terms of

743
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,919
soil type the amount of water that uh

744
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,439
that the plants are available to them

745
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,679
and

746
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,798
you know the various things that you're

747
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,080
not shading from

748
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:18,558
wind for example so

749
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,079
a given genetic background is going to

750
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,440
give you

751
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,798
basically like a set of performance

752
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,720
characteristics it does

753
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,639
this under these lights and this under

754
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,319
these other lights and

755
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,880
this range of things when grown outdoors

756
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,720
the one thing you know for sure is it's

757
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,840
going to be really different outdoors

758
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,319
than it is in the greenhouse but to come

759
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,678
back to that last part of your question

760
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,439
that's something that's going to vary

761
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,559
from strain to strain

762
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,720
some strains i don't i don't know

763
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,759
it's some strains are going to be really

764
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,600
good

765
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,440
indoors and they're just going to be

766
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,398
crap outdoors

767
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,440
or the opposite you're going to have

768
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,038
other strains

769
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:06,399
that are really a lot less sensitive

770
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:08,480
to environmental changes

771
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,038
than others and it's just it all comes

772
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,640
down basically to a complex interplay

773
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:18,000
of the set of gene networks

774
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:22,640
working in in each particular

775
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,278
in each particular plant one of the

776
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,679
you know you know if from a data

777
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:31,119
analysis perspective what you would most

778
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,278
like to have rather than say you know

779
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,119
here's the plan and it performs like

780
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:38,640
this what you would have

781
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:41,519
is a complete breakdown here it is in

782
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,278
five different growth environments and a

783
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,759
half a dozen

784
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:46,398
replications of each one so you know

785
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,158
within

786
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,439
each growth environment how much does it

787
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,360
vary and

788
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,038
how much does it vary between growth

789
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,519
environments

790
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,640
the cost of doing something like that

791
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,839
starts to get

792
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,360
fabulous very very quickly so

793
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:02,959
you have to work with less data than

794
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,798
that yeah

795
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,880
and now is that something that could

796
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,798
eventually be sort of bred into the

797
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,799
plant is to kind of have

798
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,720
i guess more robustness so they're not

799
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,240
so sensitive to those variations like

800
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,278
you mentioned out in the field

801
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:22,399
yeah yeah yeah once but

802
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,919
targeted breeding like that you need to

803
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,959
know

804
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,440
basically what are the exact genes or at

805
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,480
least

806
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,399
what are the you know chunks of the

807
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,360
genome sometimes you can do a mapping

808
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,000
and it just says

809
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,359
well it's this part of you know

810
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,079
chromosome 8

811
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:42,079
is is what's giving us this behavior but

812
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,879
you need to have you need to know

813
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,960
something like that and then once you

814
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,880
have that you can devise a molecular

815
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,240
marker and you can follow it

816
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,440
um through your crosses and breed for

817
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,440
you know in this case you know

818
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,440
robustness to environmental change

819
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,240
so there's a prior step first gotcha

820
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,000
one of the things you mentioned was you

821
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,640
know that a lot of

822
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,558
commercial commercial cultivation right

823
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,038
now is done with cuttings

824
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,759
and i imagine the goal is to eventually

825
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:18,960
get to stabilizing seeds

826
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:22,240
for for propagation so how how far away

827
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,240
do you think we are from that

828
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:30,079
so there are there are some lines

829
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,480
on the hemp side um

830
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:38,158
that are relatively homogeneous

831
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,079
um homozygous is a is the exact term

832
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:45,600
um but

833
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:48,639
you know for if we do it the traditional

834
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:51,678
uh by the traditional method um which is

835
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,320
uh years of what's called back crossing

836
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,960
targeted

837
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,879
um back crossing or you're you're

838
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,319
monitoring

839
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,600
um you know am i

840
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:05,678
fixing meaning making this homogeneous

841
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:06,719
in in the genome am i fixing all the

842
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,038
positive

843
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:15,278
um gene variants the alleles

844
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:18,240
and not what you want to avoid is fixing

845
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,599
negative alleles which is you know

846
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,640
because what you're creating is an

847
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,918
inbred line

848
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,240
the danger with inbreds is you can be

849
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,960
you

850
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,839
fix deleterious genes in there so the

851
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,798
magic of

852
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,720
making good inbreds is being able to

853
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:34,720
follow knowing enough about the genome

854
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,240
that you can breed something that that's

855
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,399
that that's inbred

856
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,159
and doesn't have you know serious

857
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:46,000
ability deleterious

858
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:48,480
um alleles in there so the

859
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,759
traditional the old-fashioned way to do

860
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,480
that takes

861
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,480
years um you know

862
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,278
depending on who you talk to you're

863
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,480
gonna get different numbers

864
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:06,558
on on how long it would take but

865
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,719
if you were just to do say

866
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,239
you know a half dozen back crosses

867
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,959
you're going to be a fair amount of the

868
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,000
way there

869
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,519
and you could do that probably in

870
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,398
you know two or three years

871
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:22,480
but to get to really good homogeneity

872
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,838
it's going to take longer than that

873
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,960
now on the other hand

874
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,960
there is a trick

875
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:34,800
called double haploids where you start

876
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,638
with a haploid cell like for example a

877
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,079
pollen

878
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,559
grain and you trick it

879
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,760
it's a chemical trick that you can do

880
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:47,199
and

881
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,000
regenerate a diploid plant from it that

882
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,279
is now

883
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,239
what you've done is you you you forced

884
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,960
it to

885
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,759
go through a doubling without creating

886
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,280
two cells

887
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,119
and bang now you've suddenly got

888
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,320
um a line that is exactly homozygous

889
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,720
at every at every position um

890
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,680
that's called double haploid technology

891
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,838
and it

892
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:16,239
doesn't exist yet in cannabis um

893
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,960
we don't technically know if it's

894
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,239
possible

895
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:24,880
in cannabis um yet

896
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:28,719
at syngenta we got it going in maze

897
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,079
and it was a nuisance but we had it

898
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,919
running then we we tried

899
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,240
and we had very good experts working on

900
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,000
we tried to get it going in tomato

901
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,039
and just failed abjectly we ended up

902
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,119
licensing from

903
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,880
another company in the netherlands that

904
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,720
had gotten it working

905
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,400
so cannabis may be you know it's

906
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,000
it's going to be really hard to get it

907
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,599
working it could be really easy or it

908
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,639
could be impossible

909
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,880
but with double haploids

910
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,960
that would revolutionize a lot of things

911
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,519
in the industry very quickly

912
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,519
so you're actually taking pollen and

913
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,358
having it essentially breed with itself

914
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,760
basically it's fascinating

915
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,679
so i would be remiss if i didn't ask you

916
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
um about your position at front range

917
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,399
biosciences

918
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,159
um what's your role there what are what

919
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,240
are the things that you're working on

920
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,358
so um i am the the director of

921
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,118
bioinformatics

922
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,480
uh you know we're a little startup so

923
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,440
it's a that's a

924
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,400
a fancy term for for basically i'm you

925
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,039
know the

926
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,800
uh doing the main amount of the the

927
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,639
bioinformatics work which is

928
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,920
mainly focused on gene discovery

929
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:45,039
um you know developing the catalog

930
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,599
of the genes that um that we'll care

931
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,559
about

932
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:54,480
for um for our breeding purposes

933
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:57,838
and so what is your focus currently

934
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,039
so i've been focused uh

935
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:04,078
on um the terpene family

936
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:07,599
and right now i'm working on

937
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,560
um the the cannabinoid uh family both

938
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,880
the

939
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,320
the what we call the terminal synthases

940
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,599
that make the individual

941
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,720
um cannabinoids um and

942
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,800
the upstream um parts of the of

943
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,759
the pathway there's a number of other

944
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,960
things that

945
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,000
you know along the way you know we're

946
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,519
we're going to get to um you know

947
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,400
disease resistance obviously is one that

948
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,559
you know there's a critical need for um

949
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,599
in cannabis but um

950
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:41,119
you know basically i mean right now i'm

951
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,800
really focused on the cannabinoid

952
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,920
pathway

953
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,599
excellent and any any cannabinoids

954
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,119
in particular is it sort of a

955
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,680
combination of the

956
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,519
the tried and true thc cbd are there

957
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,879
sort of other lesser cannabinoids that

958
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,920
you're interested in

959
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,039
yeah we're mostly interested in

960
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,400
the lesser cannabinoids in the uh so

961
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:10,159
so front range is focused on

962
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:13,440
cbd dominant legally hemp varieties

963
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,838
and so you know one of the things that

964
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,880
everybody in the field is very concerned

965
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,159
with is

966
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,440
not having your plants go hot that

967
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,920
0.3 thc

968
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,960
um so understanding what are the genes

969
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,159
that are involved

970
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,280
in creating this extraneous um thc a lot

971
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,279
of times you're seeing this

972
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,880
in in varieties where the thc synthase

973
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,680
gene

974
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,240
looks like it should be stone dead so

975
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:46,399
there are other sources of thc

976
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:49,838
so understanding understanding those

977
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,440
but then also there's a lot of interest

978
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:56,239
in the other um cannabinoids and

979
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,519
and for very good reason i mean if if

980
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,519
you only know one thing about

981
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,759
pharmaceutical chemistry it's that if

982
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,559
you've got a family of related molecules

983
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,480
and you know that

984
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,480
two or three of them are really super

985
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,559
interesting you better go look at the

986
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,039
rest of them

987
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,559
so cannabi chromium is one of the more

988
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:17,440
easy to find

989
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:20,480
but but also cbg um

990
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,679
strains the varan uh

991
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,679
cannabis cannabinoid and

992
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:30,319
thcv and

993
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:31,838
there's a number of these you know

994
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,280
lesser cannabinoids

995
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:37,440
that you know we're looking for plants

996
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,119
that make reasonable amounts of them

997
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,400
but there's a lot of there's a lot of

998
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,160
perfectly good-looking

999
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,079
synthase genes that are actually

1000
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,159
expressed

1001
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,680
in you know in flowers not at the same

1002
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,639
rate um

1003
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,838
as as the you know as the cbd and thc

1004
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,759
synthesis

1005
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:58,480
but you know they're these are real

1006
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,599
healthy genes and we'd like to know

1007
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,318
you know what do these things do

1008
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,359
excellent so you're very much focused on

1009
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,318
creating

1010
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:09,838
you know high-yield resinous buds for

1011
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,119
terpene cannabinoid

1012
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:16,639
production any interest in sort of uh

1013
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,280
looking into hemp as a as a textile or

1014
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:22,480
for other uses beyond sort of the

1015
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,680
pharmaceutical or nutraceutical uh

1016
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,039
aspects yeah yeah definitely definitely

1017
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:32,719
um there's

1018
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,519
so the um there's various sides to like

1019
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,399
you know

1020
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:39,358
the economic our argument in terms of

1021
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,800
you know what's

1022
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,400
is it profitable um for the

1023
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,599
you know for the farmer versus other

1024
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,559
things that they could they could be

1025
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,680
doing

1026
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,679
um and uh

1027
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,799
you know so that that kind of drives

1028
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,879
like where are the most important

1029
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,880
market segments for us to be looking at

1030
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,318
but you know hemp as a

1031
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,200
fiber um

1032
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:07,599
you know it's got you know this long

1033
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,919
list of really substantial advantages

1034
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,880
and

1035
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,920
if nothing else creating varieties where

1036
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,760
you get

1037
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,720
say both things going on at the same

1038
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,920
time you've got

1039
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,559
you know very good oil production and

1040
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,920
very good

1041
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:26,639
um fiber production

1042
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,838
you know that's something that that that

1043
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,879
we've talked about

1044
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:33,039
um i think it's maybe more likely that

1045
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,760
it's going to continue to be

1046
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,400
two very different um kinds of varieties

1047
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,920
but

1048
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,599
you know the short answer the question

1049
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,079
is yeah that's

1050
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,039
you know that's obviously another one

1051
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,318
that's that's

1052
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,960
you know the the other is is uh

1053
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,159
use of the as the of the seeds as a

1054
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,400
protein source

1055
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,399
um absolutely you know so

1056
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,400
well that's it's very fascinating stuff

1057
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,920
keith um

1058
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,599
where can people learn more where can

1059
