2
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:16,960
my next question is you know which one

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,679
of these indications is sort of the

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,760
furthest along or closest to actually

5
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:24,160
doing clinical trials and it sounds like

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,920
it's um this ALS motor neuron um

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,560
application M dis I I think so right

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,880
excent over the last year we've learned

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,000
a lot about ALS motor disease we've

10
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,159
learned a lot about how the cannabis

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,679
plant has helped people suffering from

12
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,759
neurological ailments um um since the

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:45,039
beginning of time in a variety of

14
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,640
different cultures and again leaning on

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,520
the experience of Dr Ethan Russo our

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,799
senior medical

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,079
adviser and what the work that they did

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,959
formerly at GW Pharma we know that

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,558
cannabis can help in severe neurological

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,878
diseases neurod degenerative diseases

21
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:05,158
and ALS MTO neuron disease is an area

22
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,438
where these patients they need help a

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,280
lot of them use cannabis right now to

24
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,919
help manage their symptoms but they

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,840
don't have something standardized and

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,118
the practitioner doesn't always know

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,680
what the patient is using even though

28
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,879
they can come into the clinic and say

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,360
hey we're using cannabis we feel better

30
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,599
we're eating more so on and so forth so

31
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,959
our goal is to be able to leverage all

32
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,280
the work previously done along with some

33
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,438
of the new work that we're doing right

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,478
now to be able to move this forward into

35
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,719
the clinic and really help a patient

36
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,879
population that's looking for answers

37
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,039
that's looking for um help that's

38
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,000
looking for a better quality of life and

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,600
really deserves to have it excellent and

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,040
now

41
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:50,280
um the therapeutic that you're sort of

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,880
evaluating is that a like a single

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,799
molecule um therapeutic or is it sort of

44
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,920
a combination of of different compounds

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:04,240
what does that look like so generally

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,118
speaking when we evaluate um our Assets

47
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,239
in any indication we put a series of

48
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,598
different candidates in there so we will

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,360
put like um highly purified single can

50
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,759
canlab and can we'll put can a extract

51
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,000
and then we could put combination

52
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,959
extract in there and see what performs

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,080
best um based on the mixture the

54
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,319
cocktail mixture the almost Entourage or

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,560
synergistic approach right now based on

56
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:34,199
the work previously done and based on

57
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,159
again being a student of Dr re so we

58
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,598
know that in the clinic for humans it's

59
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,000
probably not going to be a single

60
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:44,318
mixture a single ingredient that has the

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,158
best opportunity to help these patients

62
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,839
it's going to be a cocktail mixture or

63
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,598
cocktail approach not dissimilar to how

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,280
these patients are getting treated right

65
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:56,119
now but we can talk about that a little

66
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,318
bit later um as I was saying we put

67
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,840
together a series of um different

68
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,359
molecules found in the plant at various

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,519
concentrations at safe concentrations

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,599
that we believe can be delivered to

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,480
patients chronically on an everyday

72
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,679
basis that can help them manage their

73
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,479
symptoms that can improve their quality

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,319
of life and might also be

75
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,158
neuroprotective as well um and help them

76
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,878
with survival so we think that we have

77
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,598
something that can be disease modifying

78
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:25,318
now we just have to continue to go out

79
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,959
improve it great and so and so where are

80
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,438
we at now and I mean maybe let's how

81
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,200
about a little preview I don't want you

82
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:33,400
give way too much because we want people

83
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,479
to come out to the event but um what

84
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,640
what are you looking to present at at

85
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:41,000
canmed so at canmed I we have a series

86
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,238
of again previous literature that's been

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,438
done but also some unique exper

88
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,560
experiments that we've recently done to

89
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:50,039
validate that our combination actually

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,400
does work how we think it's going to

91
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,878
work so I'm really excited to share some

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,319
of this information share again the

93
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,239
process that we went through from

94
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:02,560
looking at all the things previously

95
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,360
done to adding our unique twists on it

96
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,158
and then showing uh what the result is

97
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,159
and how we got it to work in our favor

98
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:25,160
[Music]

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,160
excellent
