1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,240
good afternoon uh thanks everyone for

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,919
showing up this afternoon i appreciate

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,519
the organizers keeping the place so cold

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,359
so we all stay awake

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,359
um and it seems like folks don't like

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,519
flies so i don't know you know maybe we

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,079
scared a few of them off with the title

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,920
um dr douglas is not here today he

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,559
welcomed a new member of his family not

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,960
too long ago so he's managing that

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,118
little wrangling um tons of fun those

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,359
little ones but he's sorry he can't make

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:35,600
it and hopefully i can carry you know

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,399
carry things properly in his absence

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
so

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,799
you know horrifying title who let the

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,799
flies in

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,559
what we wanted to talk about there were

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
some things that we think are coming

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,039
down the pipeline in terms of concerns

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,558
questions and what else may be of

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,160
interest to

23
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,159
understanding the products that we're

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,479
using and understanding how to best

25
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,238
utilize the compositions of interest to

26
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,279
ourselves and especially to medical

27
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,839
patients

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,000
um it's probably not lost to anyone here

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
especially in the cannabis arena about a

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,478
valley you know it actually did happen

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,118
we had concerns with products that were

32
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,879
being utilized for vaporization

33
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,719
where those products were at what

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,679
exactly was in all of the compositions

35
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,280
of them

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,040
how many of them

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,200
actually persisted

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,560
unfortunately the pandemic certainly

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
curbed the

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,600
cdc's reporting um kind of sucked up all

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,200
the resources the last update was

42
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:34,158
february 25th of 2020 actually on the

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,880
valley website on the cdc's home page

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,680
there

45
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,359
so

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
we do know what happens we do know it

47
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,359
can happen so how do we think about what

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,079
happened what have we learned from it

49
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,239
and how do we best avoid it and a big

50
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,639
piece of that was we really need to

51
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,798
consider what we do for inhalation the

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,320
molecules that we're going to inhale are

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,560
very different in terms of a

54
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,239
toxicological profile than what else

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,920
we've used them for whether it be

56
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,919
topical use even oral ingestion routes

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,600
our lungs and our route of ingestion

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759
through inhalation is very different

59
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,679
than if we are to consume them orally or

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,399
apply them topically

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
and

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,719
to consume them via inhalation we have

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,040
to heat things so

64
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,039
the rule in chemistry is about every 10

65
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,039
degrees in celsius chemical reaction

66
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,799
rates may double

67
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,560
and that's not a very big temperature

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
change when you start to think about how

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,439
hot some of the handheld devices might

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,439
get how hot a vaporizer might get

71
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,039
e-cigarette hardware

72
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,759
and especially when you go all the way

73
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,919
up to combustion so

74
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,120
it's something to not overlook it's

75
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,598
something that we definitely have to

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,840
consider and we need to kind of pay

77
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,159
attention to what might be the molecular

78
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,400
fate what might these things decompose

79
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,639
into how much of them might be around

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,800
and how do we actually you know concern

81
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,958
ourselves with this before we put

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
products out in the marketplace so that

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
we can avoid a situation like we saw

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,519
with the valley cases

85
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,759
what's presumed to be the major culprit

86
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,959
that formed ivali is

87
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,598
shown here vitamin e acetate and we

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,840
believe chemists believe that it is the

89
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,079
phenolic acetate function that caused

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,239
that to happen if you heat that hot

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,879
enough you start to see it break down

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,120
into a molecule we call ketene and this

93
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,598
is a highly reactive molecule so this

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,519
molecule is most likely what was causing

95
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,919
the chemical burns and the problems

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,400
inside the lungs and the airways and it

97
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,399
forms when you really really really heat

98
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,959
compounds like this

99
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,319
one current concern that i've got um we

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,759
heard it uh mentioned a little bit

101
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:40,318
earlier today thco or thc acetate it's

102
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,919
also a phenolic acetate now i don't

103
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,919
think anyone's done thermal degradation

104
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,280
studies on it to see its propensity to

105
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,079
form ketene

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,799
it may or may not form ketene under

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,560
typical conditions in vape hardware

108
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,640
and it's still a question that's out

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
there and hopefully we don't see other

110
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,479
problems like we saw with vitamin e

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
acetate

112
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,000
it's also interesting that vitamin

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,400
acetate may still be going around not

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,318
everybody necessarily got the memo and

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,560
it is raises the question is that

116
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,039
related to vitamin e acetate in specific

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,280
hardware or was it only always just that

118
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,438
molecule so what temperature

119
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
temperatures do things get to how hot

120
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,759
are these devices what does the molecule

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
experience for which period of time

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
all important questions

123
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,280
and i want to highlight the point that

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,240
vitamin e acetate is grass it is

125
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:31,198
generally recognized as safe for uses in

126
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,360
foods so it's not generally recognized

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,319
as safe for any and every use certainly

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,319
not for inhalation

129
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,959
this work presented here is

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,720
work from the strongen lab in oregon

131
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,120
state and they were exploring

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,600
cannabinoid degradation what's the fate

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,478
of cannabinoids when i heat them up via

134
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
a vape cartridge or via dabbing where

135
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,680
the temperatures might be a little

136
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,918
hotter they use both delta 9 thc and cbm

137
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,560
and you can see that the volatile

138
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,079
volatile organic content actually

139
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,879
comprises a number of different

140
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,599
molecules and i'd like to highlight that

141
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,360
there is acetone seen on the top two as

142
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,479
well so and i'll bring that up a little

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
bit later

144
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:16,639
but i think that the basic takeaway from

145
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,879
this is it's not only thc all the time

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,120
right so i start with thc but if i heat

147
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,360
it up it might decompose it falls apart

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,759
into other molecules some which may be

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,680
of interest some which may not be

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,080
and those things are really what's going

151
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,319
on when we're heating vape devices we're

152
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,038
utilizing those and through combustion

153
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,199
processes so we had previously published

154
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,439
we know how much is in a pre-roll and if

155
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,160
you go and combust that you do not find

156
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,719
100 of the thc going into the airway and

157
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,240
in fact you can't find all of the thc's

158
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,960
fate because it breaks down to things

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,759
like this which are hard to capture

160
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,279
terpenes unfortunately do the same thing

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,038
and depending upon which terpene you

162
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,198
have and again which temperatures you've

163
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,279
got you will see them start to degrade

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,360
in different ways and you will see a

165
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,359
different profile of the other volatile

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
substances that form

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,199
and here i'd also like to note that

168
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,038
acetone is a lot more prevalent i don't

169
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,160
know if there's a laser pointer on this

170
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,800
one or not

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,880
um but it's you know the second one

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,280
apologize for the chemistry the second

173
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,680
one on the mercedes one uh acetone the

174
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,439
third one on the lymanine one so we see

175
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,360
certain amounts of acetone and again

176
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,680
i'll bring that up a little bit later

177
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,439
but and beta-carotelline forms

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
predominantly acetone along with some

179
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,839
others so we've got a little bit of a

180
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,918
clue about what might be going on when

181
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,000
we start to heat these molecules under

182
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,799
different conditions and again it is

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,680
very condition specific so

184
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600
we produced pure terpenes complex blends

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,600
from them and we started to do a lot of

186
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
analysis and you start to see

187
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
testing laboratories come back with

188
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,759
residual solvents you know like

189
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,959
how does this start to happen you know

190
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,560
where is the solvent coming from um

191
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,239
because it's not okay to put any

192
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,079
solvents into these products they should

193
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,478
shouldn't be around and if these

194
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,159
materials are coming from distillations

195
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,758
they should have no solvents such as

196
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
acetone or the other light volatiles in

197
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,520
there either there really

198
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,840
wasn't a rational reason for why these

199
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,000
things might be showing up on the tests

200
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,478
so the first part that we did was let's

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
just take a vial an empty vial put it

202
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,519
out there in the lab atmosphere and see

203
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,959
if there's acetone floating around and

204
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,799
maybe showing up

205
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,799
on some of the results because these

206
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,199
methodologies are very sensitive and can

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,759
detect these things at very low levels

208
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,720
residual solvent analysis is done via

209
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,560
headspace analysis with gcms so it is a

210
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,880
sensitive technique you can see very

211
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,478
small amounts of these things and it is

212
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,399
possible that you've got you know a lot

213
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,639
of acetone in a lab or other solvents

214
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,399
that might be confounding these results

215
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,079
we did not see that here that first

216
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,519
block there is the empty vial didn't

217
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,598
matter what happened in there was not a

218
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,680
lot of acetone present in the lab or

219
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,000
even in the vials

220
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,959
then we tested a series of other pure

221
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,959
terpenes and terpenoids we also mixed

222
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,799
them all together one to one to one and

223
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,959
we made a complex formulation that

224
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,038
mimicked one of the cultivar profiles

225
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,878
that we've seen as well and you can see

226
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,800
each of them started to show this

227
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,039
general trend and it's a little hard to

228
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,079
read perhaps because it's small but the

229
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,000
first

230
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,159
data point on the left is when we took

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,639
the vial and purged it with argon to try

232
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,680
and flush away as much of the lab's

233
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,160
atmosphere and impart a neutral you know

234
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,079
inert atmosphere of argon into the vial

235
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,919
sealed it and use that inside the

236
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,158
injection the next one is just

237
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,598
laboratory air that was pushed in after

238
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,599
we flushed with argon so we tried to

239
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,120
fill it up with air and the third data

240
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,680
point was when we added something with a

241
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,679
high oxygen content so boost oxygen type

242
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,519
stuff that we bought let's try to put as

243
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,919
much oxygen in there and see if we start

244
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,240
to see other degradations and

245
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,240
mostly we did we saw that the lab

246
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,320
atmosphere had a certain amount when you

247
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,120
remove that atmosphere you don't see it

248
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,800
it's argon based is very low in numbers

249
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,080
and when you add oxygen you see those

250
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,439
things go up a little bit and the

251
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
results were all statistically

252
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
significant

253
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,439
then we started to think well i don't

254
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,519
see it all growing down to acetone what

255
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,160
else might be happening

256
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,560
and this also tells us that our sample

257
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,120
preparation is critical to analyzing

258
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,199
exactly what's there so a big part of

259
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
analytical chemistry is how do i know

260
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
what i'm holding and how do i get it to

261
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,120
some sort of detection method that has

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
not altered exactly what i'm holding in

263
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,080
my hand and this kind of told us that

264
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,480
these residual solvent analyses probably

265
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,720
need a little work in sample prep the

266
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,399
injector temperatures in the gc the

267
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,320
methodologies of getting those vials

268
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,559
warmed up to put the volatiles in the

269
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,399
headspace all of those might have an

270
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,639
impact on the overall chemistry of

271
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,639
what's going on in the vial and that's

272
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,319
not necessarily representative of what

273
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,080
i'm holding in my hand or what's been

274
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
placed in my vape cart or other product

275
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,680
composition

276
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
and when you look into degradation i i

277
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,559
don't know if everybody might have heard

278
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,640
the talk earlier today about the

279
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,079
environmental chemistry that goes on

280
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,278
there's some pretty wild stuff that

281
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,959
actually happens to some of these

282
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,639
molecules over time under the right

283
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,479
conditions

284
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,958
and here's just a picture of some of the

285
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,278
pathways that go on in that regard

286
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,439
air oxygen other types of things can

287
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,360
catalyze those reactions certain

288
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,360
hardware inside of vape hardware or

289
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,639
metal catalysis might actually be a part

290
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,480
of that um we tried to add a little bit

291
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,120
of things to accelerate some of this and

292
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,200
we didn't see any great accelerations um

293
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,799
we think oxygen and the normal air was

294
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,959
the major culprit of these things but

295
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,319
there's still a little bit more work

296
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,719
ongoing before we're actually going to

297
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,040
publish all the results in this paper

298
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,079
but it does tell us there weren't really

299
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,919
these solvents inside of the you know

300
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,759
formulations that were produced or these

301
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,679
pure terpenes that we're getting it's

302
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,600
predominantly coming from analytical

303
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,759
methodology and i think that was an

304
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,278
important piece hopefully others will

305
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,759
start to adopt different analytical

306
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,559
methodology towards understanding how to

307
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,879
get good residual solvent results um

308
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,639
from compliance tests as well

309
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,838
and it made us start to think like could

310
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,120
we model uh potentially vape you know

311
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,519
hardware vape effluent streams utilizing

312
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,959
gas chromatographs so we is it a really

313
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,799
big giant vaporizer um in some sense

314
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,559
i've got a liquid that i'm going to put

315
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,559
into an injector it's going to heat to a

316
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,799
certain temperature it's going to try to

317
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,000
aerosolize or volatilize the molecules

318
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,359
that are in there and then they're going

319
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,639
to travel down the path and we can

320
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,480
detect them

321
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,639
and if you look at a you know handheld

322
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,240
e-cigarette it's pretty similar i've got

323
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,759
a liquid in there it starts to get hot

324
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,519
to a certain temperature air flows

325
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,559
through it and these molecules go down

326
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,120
an airway

327
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,278
happens to go into our airways but those

328
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,200
two things are pretty similar so i think

329
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,360
there's you know a glimmer of hope that

330
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,600
we might be able to model some vape

331
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
hardware in certain fashions or at least

332
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,480
glean toxicological perspectives on what

333
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,959
types of molecules may be formed in

334
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,200
which amounts from the breakdown of the

335
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:56,000
compositions that we're using inside of

336
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,000
these e-cigarette hardware pieces or

337
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,480
concentrates dabs or even other

338
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,078
inhalable products

339
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,920
and it's important to note this is

340
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,919
probably a good picture brad put this in

341
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,719
there i'm mostly vegan so he made sure

342
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,559
that we showed the steak to everyone

343
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
but you can all assess you know

344
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,199
different things change via time and

345
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,958
temperature so the hotter i've had my

346
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,040
steak on the grill the longer it's been

347
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,799
there the less rare it is the different

348
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,559
in color it is the different taste and

349
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,278
flavor and the different smells that i

350
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,958
get and all of those are telling us

351
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,200
there are chemical transformations and

352
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,719
chemical changes that are going on and

353
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,639
again it's the time and temperature

354
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,879
relationship so

355
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,879
it's important to note that gc liquid

356
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,078
samples what i place inside this you

357
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:43,120
know auto sampler isn't always what the

358
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,039
detector is going to be only looking at

359
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,959
my injector temperature may change

360
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,958
things and different chemistry may even

361
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,719
happen before it goes all the way down

362
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,078
the path to the detector

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,160
and it's important to consider that

364
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,278
that's also probably happening to some

365
00:12:54,159 --> 00:13:00,240
degree inside of the vape hardware so my

366
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,759
cannabis extract my cannabis formulation

367
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,120
may be different than what's actually

368
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,439
hitting my lungs

369
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,360
to which extent i think is a very very

370
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
difficult complex and technically

371
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,519
challenging problem to answer

372
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,360
um i don't want to send alarm bells off

373
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,759
we've been seeing lots and lots and lots

374
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,159
of inhalation used for lots of time and

375
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,919
we don't see many many acute problems i

376
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,159
think the you know the number of valley

377
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:25,120
cases up to february of 2020 was only

378
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,039
around 2 800. um there are probably tens

379
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,759
of millions of folks that vape almost

380
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,159
every day so i want to keep the number

381
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,919
and relative perspective no one deserves

382
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,439
any of that harm so even one is an

383
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,679
alarming case

384
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,279
but it's not like we're seeing you know

385
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,039
tens of millions or hundreds of

386
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,958
thousands every day presenting with this

387
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,958
problem that would be a very different

388
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,439
scenario

389
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,119
unfortunately we kind of confound what's

390
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,360
going on with the chemical compositions

391
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,039
and the profiles by playing the name

392
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,159
game so we published

393
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:59,360
early on 2015 i believe it was

394
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,000
how your chemical profile on a flower

395
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,440
might not represent the the name so a

396
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,759
lot of folks will call something blue

397
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,600
dream or og kush it doesn't mean that

398
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,159
every one of those has the exact same

399
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,519
blue dream or og kush chemical profile

400
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,519
unfortunately

401
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,000
there is no nomenclature that's fixed

402
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,759
towards chemical compositions this goes

403
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,440
further when you even say that this

404
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,720
flower was what i used to do my

405
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,240
extraction

406
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
in this case it was diamond dust and

407
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,360
when that flower was extracted i have a

408
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,399
diamond dust concentrate so i think for

409
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,199
most of us

410
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,039
most general consumers the assumption is

411
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,879
well all the molecules i wanted just

412
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,480
perfectly went exactly over into the

413
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,838
concentrate because that's what i wanted

414
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,120
them to do

415
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,880
chemistry experience tells me the

416
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,959
molecules almost never do exactly what i

417
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,720
want to do ever

418
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,278
and here is a kind of a graphical

419
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,639
representation showing yes you pulled

420
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,320
some of them off but they're now in

421
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,560
different ratios they are in different

422
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,079
types you probably have isomeric or

423
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,879
oxidative things that have happened

424
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,439
throughout that extraction process

425
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,439
and there are prevalent pieces like this

426
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,399
no matter what your extraction process

427
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,800
is i do not have a perfect process to

428
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,958
remove only cellulose or only amino

429
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,958
acids and leave behind just the

430
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,759
cannabinoids and just the terpenes

431
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,439
exactly as the flower produced them so i

432
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,439
think you know we hear a lot of talk and

433
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,600
recently there's been a lot of talk

434
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,519
in california because the department of

435
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,600
cannabis control just released some

436
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,759
draft regulations talking about which

437
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,079
terpenes or terpene types ingredients

438
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,278
might be useful for inhaled products

439
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:30,879
and

440
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,278
a lot of folks thought that their

441
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,639
extraction for cannabis derived terpenes

442
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,559
meant that it was exactly what the

443
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,879
flower presented and that is

444
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,239
unfortunately not the case so it's

445
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,078
probably good that we've got greater

446
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,639
diversity but something to pay attention

447
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,319
to and something to know i can't say my

448
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,839
blue dream flower necessarily always

449
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,759
drives the blue dream concentrate

450
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,360
effects because those compositions are

451
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,360
very different

452
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,360
there are approaches that you can use

453
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,240
using individual molecules that will get

454
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,079
you to replicate the flowers profile in

455
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,480
a much greater fashion so with far

456
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,879
better precision and accuracy you can

457
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,800
drive profiles that look exactly like

458
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,399
the ones the flower produced you of

459
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,639
course have other flexibility that goes

460
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,720
along with that as well but in that case

461
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,360
you can say this is far greater

462
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,959
representation of what was on the flower

463
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
doesn't mean that any one of them is any

464
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,719
better than the other it just means that

465
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,639
this is an exact copy or as close to

466
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,480
exact as we can get today

467
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,000
of what the flower produced and if we

468
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,079
are trying to say hey we understand

469
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,919
these flowers we understand their use

470
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,319
and the patient populations that are

471
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,639
benefiting from them here's how we can

472
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,480
put those profiles into other products

473
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,079
such as inhalable products like

474
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,399
vaporizers

475
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,638
other concentrate forms or infused

476
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,320
products like tinctures topicals and

477
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,240
edible products as well

478
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,399
keeping those profiles consistent

479
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,639
standardized and highly scalable is what

480
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,879
is really important important to medical

481
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,519
patients in the medical population and i

482
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,679
think also to adult brands that say look

483
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,440
i have a consistent product so

484
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,919
consistency as we heard from the

485
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,680
cultivation efforts earlier today very

486
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,318
very difficult to come up with the exact

487
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,480
same profiles every single time

488
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,240
how do i treat a molecule as a molecule

489
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,759
and replicate that in a standardized

490
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
scalable fashion

491
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,439
using the individual components and

492
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,119
formulating them will lend towards that

493
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,038
type of approach and i think leads to

494
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,879
great scalability

495
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,279
and that is a good representation of

496
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,520
what the flowers produced

497
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,279
importantly we think it is kind of a

498
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,759
good collective time for all of us to

499
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,678
start considering inhalation safety

500
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,839
we know that the large bulk of the

501
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,840
dispensary shelves today are inhalation

502
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,558
products whether they are flowers that

503
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,199
are being consumed concentrates or vape

504
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,359
products right those things can comprise

505
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,679
the significant portion of cannabis

506
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,439
products today there are also some

507
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,200
unique benefits that are imparted by

508
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,240
inhalation products certain medical

509
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,480
patients and patient populations really

510
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,720
demand that type of rapid response they

511
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,960
demand that type of effectiveness and

512
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,000
they're not finding it from other

513
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,679
delivery forms so inhalation does offer

514
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,038
a unique route and i think it's you know

515
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,440
kind of a critical part for us

516
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:10,079
scientists to say how can i develop this

517
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,919
in a very intelligent way to lend

518
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,240
towards the lowest toxicology

519
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,000
perspective possible while delivering

520
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,759
standardized consistent products for

521
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,359
patients to benefit from

522
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,279
we all got started at least i got

523
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,798
started because of medical cannabis most

524
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,879
of california's forgotten the word of

525
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,119
medical of late most of the west coast

526
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,120
too but they are an important part of

527
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,038
this population they are still driving a

528
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,839
lot of the adult use store

529
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,038
sales and volumes and i really think

530
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,759
it's important that they are never

531
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,599
forgotten like this is important to keep

532
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,359
a very good quality product that is

533
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,839
standardized and consistent so these

534
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,159
patients can get that benefit and relief

535
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,839
that they deserve and that we all have

536
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,798
been fighting for and continue to fight

537
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,279
for

538
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,519
it's um i think important upon us today

539
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,519
to say let's come together and start to

540
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,679
talk about inhalation safety let's try

541
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,839
to educate regulators we can see in

542
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,679
different states that some of them

543
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,759
certainly don't know chemistry very well

544
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,519
or are not really understanding some of

545
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,640
the nuances that go with inhalation

546
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,480
safety

547
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,640
the food extract manufacturing

548
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,160
association had this problem

549
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
a while ago

550
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,519
they convened their own panels they got

551
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,519
together and they said let's start to

552
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,160
understand how we can assess the

553
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,759
toxicological profile of these extracts

554
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,919
that we're producing how do we know

555
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,558
they'll be generally recognized as safe

556
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,320
for use in foods at which levels and

557
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,240
it's important i think that the cannabis

558
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,879
industry understands that and tries to

559
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,400
model that it's also important that we

560
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,559
do not let happen

561
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
anyone consider cannabis to be just like

562
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,558
nicotine and tobacco they are very very

563
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,640
very different plants they have very

564
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,038
different uses very different chemical

565
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,038
profiles for importance and use and it

566
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,160
would be remiss to all of us if someone

567
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:49,519
says well let's just treat it like

568
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,038
tobacco

569
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,038
that would be a problem and we would

570
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,038
leave a lot of people in a bad position

571
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,720
that are looking you know to cannabis

572
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,200
for medical purposes

573
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,720
so a good start might be hey let's take

574
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,319
the information in the body of knowledge

575
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,960
that we know that was generated by

576
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,720
things like vitamin e acetate or things

577
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,919
that we've seen other studies with that

578
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,600
says let's not use those for inhalation

579
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,120
or these are the things that are found

580
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,959
in the cannabis plant we've been

581
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,959
inhaling and consuming them even at

582
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,558
combustion temperatures for a while

583
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,400
let's say that those things are pretty

584
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,759
okay and start here

585
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,840
because building this body of

586
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,919
toxicological work is going to take a

587
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,240
considerable amount of time money and

588
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,480
effort so we won't have this answer next

589
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,480
week even if we also decided to lock

590
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,240
ourselves in this room it will take a

591
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,558
lot longer than that but we have to

592
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,400
start somewhere and we can't start with

593
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,240
just some regulators saying i think this

594
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
makes sense

595
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,400
i think that's going to lend up to being

596
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,000
much more problematic and really trying

597
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,679
to unwind some of those things can be

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,440
very very difficult

599
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,960
so some of the key points that i want to

600
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,798
make sure everyone understands is the

601
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,519
compositions change with all of your

602
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,200
process steps so anytime i do anything

603
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,519
even if that's setting up my analytical

604
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,360
sample i might see changes in the

605
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,440
chemical composition that i thought i

606
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,000
was dealing with or that i put inside of

607
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,558
a formulation or a specific device

608
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,440
extraction changes them and heat is the

609
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,440
major culprit and heat accelerates

610
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,600
degradation with oxygen air and other

611
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,798
things that are floating all around us

612
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,119
it's very important to get your

613
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,119
analytical methodology right i think a

614
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,359
lot of current labs today don't have the

615
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,719
residual solvent methodologies super

616
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,639
dialed in that's why we're seeing some

617
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,400
of these nuances but we don't always see

618
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,159
a lot of products fail

619
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,759
for compliance testing but there's a way

620
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,840
to kind of tighten this up in a simple

621
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,599
fashion make it easy and

622
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,599
more robust and we'll get more accurate

623
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,599
understanding of what's going on

624
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,599
i think understanding aerosol testing

625
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,038
like the work out of strongens lab and

626
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,959
some others now that are kind of getting

627
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,879
along with this that field is advancing

628
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,240
and using gas chromatographs to kind of

629
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,520
understand

630
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,359
what we might see in these you know

631
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,679
heated effluent streams out of vape

632
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,798
devices or even via concentrate

633
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,559
consumption

634
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,918
and other inhalation means is very

635
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,079
important towards informing our

636
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,759
toxicological perspective and

637
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,678
understanding of which molecules might

638
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,640
be best on a permitted or prohibited

639
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,280
list

640
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,759
and again the name game still persists i

641
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,519
don't know how to solve this one yet

642
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,960
maybe someday in the shower we'll get a

643
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,639
good idea and we'll actually say like

644
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,360
this is a good answer

645
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,320
it's a complex problem it hopefully will

646
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,918
start to

647
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,839
get less

648
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,840
i'd say less problematic as things start

649
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,119
to be standardized and more consistent

650
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,959
if we can start with consistent

651
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,959
cultivation consistent processing

652
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,960
methods we should all be able to lead

653
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,840
towards more consistent products in the

654
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,038
end

655
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,720
and as i described there are a couple

656
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,519
approaches that might really help us

657
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,798
elucidate consistent formulations and

658
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,079
chemical profiles of those products

659
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,759
i thought this was a little bit of a

660
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,439
funny one but chemistry is definitely

661
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,879
not to be feared nothing in life should

662
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,759
be feared as long as you can understand

663
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,520
it um but you know i thought this was

664
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,400
funny until i was sitting there talking

665
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,079
to a legislative aide and a staff member

666
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,240
that were trying to write rules and

667
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,079
regulations around hemp and the novel

668
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,679
cannabinoids and the first thing that i

669
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,759
got after i was introduced by an

670
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,280
independent third party they said oh i

671
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,640
did terrible in chemistry and failed on

672
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,960
math i was told that there wouldn't be

673
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,640
much of that here so i'm like well delta

674
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,759
a delta nine delta ten and all these

675
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,919
other things i'm gonna start throwing

676
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,359
you are all chemistry so

677
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,038
other than giving you copy paste

678
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,319
language you know i don't know how we

679
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,158
can help but we have to have a

680
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,558
conversation it's not impossible to

681
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,559
understand but these things are what are

682
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:28,639
important when we're talking about what

683
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,158
can patients and consumers access what

684
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,120
might we be putting into the public

685
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,159
sphere what might cause harm or not and

686
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,158
we do

687
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,400
unfortunately not have a lot of

688
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,559
science-minded folks that are writing

689
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,640
the rules regulations or legislation

690
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,839
especially the legislation most of them

691
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,320
seem to be

692
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,319
english or legal majors um they are

693
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,480
fearful of the word chemistry and math i

694
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,798
can assure you i've seen it firsthand

695
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,558
but i you know try to gently offer

696
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,079
education and always available for

697
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,079
support and i think most of us

698
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,558
scientists are always happy to have the

699
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,079
conversation and educate so don't be

700
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,918
afraid of it it's not a bad word

701
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,678
chemistry is actually okay i've got my

702
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,759
little boy saying molecules already he's

703
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,360
under three it's fine

704
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,200
but understanding the world around us

705
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,278
and what we can get from that is really

706
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,640
the important piece of that and thank

707
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,299
you all for your time and attention

708
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,480
today i appreciate it

709
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:24,759
[Applause]

710
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,759
happy to take any questions

711
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,240
good luck no i'm just kidding um i get

712
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,080
this question a lot so how do you enable

713
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,319
a patient with just a minute or two like

714
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,480
what's the best way to go about it do as

715
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,798
much research as you can on the producer

716
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,558
and their consistency find certificate

717
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,558
of analyses they're supposed to be

718
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,960
available in most states by rules and

719
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,960
regulation you would be surprised how

720
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,720
hard it is to try and get those even

721
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,159
when they are supposed to be available

722
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,480
by rule

723
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,120
but you can if you are persistent so be

724
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,759
persistent do your research go find all

725
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,599
the cfas that you can and you can

726
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,839
probably pretty quickly assess

727
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,000
standardized you know standardized

728
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,678
product and process relatively quickly

729
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,720
if you start seeing numbers with wide

730
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,798
ranges

731
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,798
if it's at the same lab that lab is

732
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,558
probably consistently doing the same

733
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,400
thing they might be off the center of

734
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,038
the target but they're consistent so a

735
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,519
relative consistent analysis showing the

736
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,278
inconsistent profiles tells me there's a

737
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:30,480
lot of variability going on in the back

738
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,079
end um and then try through experience

739
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,319
and communication have you tried

740
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,158
different batches do you know like have

741
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,918
that conversation do you know have these

742
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,840
been consistent for you

743
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,240
um it's tough because we're all you know

744
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,678
variable every day right so even if i

745
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,120
get the same products i might need a

746
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,679
little more a little less from day to

747
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,079
day but through certificate of analysis

748
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,600
research and then ask a testing lab or

749
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,278
you know come back to the doctor and say

750
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,119
i found these 10 things what do you

751
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,359
think you probably can assess pretty

752
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,278
quickly not the producer or yes that's

753
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:03,719
the type of producer for me it's like

754
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,720
the best that we can do today so far

755
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,240
i i think yeah like it's so if i'm

756
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,400
looking for inhalable product or a vape

757
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,798
cart how do i assess that from a patient

758
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,798
or consumer perspective yeah what's on

759
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,519
the label what else might be going into

760
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,119
there um you know i'm not fearful of

761
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,038
synthetic or natural labels i think

762
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,959
there's a misnomer natural means safe

763
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:31,599
well ricin belladonna other things

764
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,319
they're all toxic poison ivy natural

765
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,639
totally not safe um what molecules are

766
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,480
being used in them are there any in

767
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,080
there that might cause concern have i

768
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,839
seen that from other states that's

769
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,480
pretty complicated and difficult i think

770
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,079
for most of the general population to do

771
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,000
but states are starting to require

772
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,079
disclosures on some of the molecules in

773
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,278
there i think there's a problem with

774
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,119
that where you start to read some of

775
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,880
these things you're like i can't even

776
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,359
pronounce them right there's they're too

777
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,760
big what does that mean if i read a

778
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,759
report it might really be off because

779
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,278
that toxicology report might be on the

780
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,119
pure substance and at high

781
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,278
concentrations and just that molecule it

782
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,038
might be bad but in a vape card it's at

783
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,759
a fraction of a fraction of a percent

784
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:14,720
and it's really okay the dose makes the

785
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,558
poison so i'd say you know consistency

786
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,000
of production you know are you seeing

787
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,558
the same effects if you used it from

788
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,079
batch over batch and what's on the label

789
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,240
and what do you know about it ask the

790
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,918
producer if they're trying to answer in

791
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,440
a very good fashion you could probably

792
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,679
feel more comfortable that they felt

793
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,159
confident but if they're like ducking

794
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,000
the question that's probably a flag to

795
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,440
say they either don't know or they don't

796
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,720
want you to know and you can probably

797
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,960
move on to someone else that would be

798
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,960
more transparent

799
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:47,889
[Music]

800
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,440
uh um our gc analysis on acetone was a

801
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,679
residual headspace um headspace solvent

802
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,519
analysis with gcms so there are

803
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,880
headspace files that were capped and

804
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,200
sealed placed in the headspace

805
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,200
autosampler warmed up to temperature

806
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,519
injected and then hit the ms and then we

807
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,120
could see acetone was like one of the

808
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,558
major culprits there are some other

809
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,359
things that you could see obviously the

810
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,278
ones that california's residual solvents

811
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,038
on the list that they look for but you

812
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,798
can't detect everything so that big

813
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,119
complex picture says there's all sorts

814
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,359
of other stuff that probably is present

815
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,599
but the lab's not tuned to look for so

816
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,199
when you see a small amount of acetone

817
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,319
yeah that's there and then in that slide

818
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,399
it was at i think 6.7 or so so that's

819
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,839
what that breakdown into but it broke

820
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,239
down to a lot of other stuff that you're

821
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,398
not detecting so we're gonna try to see

822
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,960
how much of the actual terpene is left

823
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,918
it's a little tricky experiment um but

824
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,919
that's how we got there

825
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,760
no we didn't do it that way no he didn't

826
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,839
have and that would be an interesting

827
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,000
one like if i inhaled and then exhaled

828
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,000
what did i catch out here well i what

829
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,480
did i keep in my lungs and bloodstream

830
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,398
too i could see maybe traces of some

831
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,480
stuff but my concentrations go down and

832
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:01,199
it gets harder you can hook up

833
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,720
e-cigarettes to devices um strongens

834
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,600
lab's done that we've done some of that

835
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,200
we say i've trapped all of the you know

836
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,519
vapor stream coming out of an

837
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,240
e-cigarette device or even a pre-roll

838
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,839
what do i see this way and there's a

839
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,079
couple of technical challenges with what

840
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,240
did i trap how did i trap it am i sure i

841
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,720
got it all is it stuck in a tube before

842
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,720
i got there you know how do i figure out

843
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,319
the entire mass balance like if i

844
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,038
started with 100 molecules of these and

845
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,439
it broke into 30 things how much of each

846
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,038
of those equals that 100 molecules you

847
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,120
don't always get there and it's a little

848
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,558
frustrating but it's because i'd

849
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,158
probably need five different detection

850
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:37,519
methods to kind of make sure i could

851
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,640
fill out the whole picture and that's

852
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,879
just too costly to do right now

853
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,880
sure

854
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,440
um

855
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:59,278
so they're the live rosin live resin

856
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,399
hydrocarbon extracts sauce batter butter

857
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,119
whatever you want to call it these days

858
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,439
co2 extracts any extracts composition is

859
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,759
different than the flour are they any

860
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,360
safer better they're all different right

861
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,038
so i don't know if we should use words

862
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,798
like safer or better i hear a lot of

863
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,240
folks like i think this one's better

864
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:15,839
great personal opinion thank you for

865
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,599
that maybe i could try this one or the

866
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,959
others and we'll see if i agree but

867
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,879
you're not telling me anything other

868
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,798
than your personal opinion for what you

869
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,240
think is better what's best is what's

870
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:25,918
right for the consumer and the patient

871
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,519
and what they get the best results with

872
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,320
which may be very different than what

873
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,240
that person thought was best

874
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,158
they produce different profiles some of

875
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,359
the live rosin or other things might

876
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,120
have higher

877
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,719
contents of other molecules like fats

878
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,038
and waxes depending upon how they

879
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,278
actually go down the process and not all

880
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,798
those processes are exactly standardized

881
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,519
or exactly the same so two different

882
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,278
producers even doing a live rosin type

883
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,038
of process may produce very different

884
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,159
things from the same plants depending

885
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:56,000
upon exactly how they do it

886
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,519
are they bad i mean i think they're

887
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,480
solvent-less so you haven't introduced

888
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,399
anything

889
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,960
you have a pretty good composition that

890
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,239
you're resulting to but that again is

891
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,159
different than what i started with the

892
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,240
flower and there could be things that

893
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,480
change terpene compositions in that

894
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,399
right so i've got pressure that's

895
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,640
similar to heat if i've done any sorts

896
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,719
of things that have tried to touch these

897
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,480
molecules they may oxidize they may

898
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,880
isomerize they may come into different

899
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,038
things so some folks we know took like

900
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
cannabis derived terpenes and threw them

901
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,558
through the analysis and you're like i

902
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,079
can see about half of what's here even

903
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,158
though i thought i saw a lot of this

904
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,158
stuff to start with on the flower

905
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,919
it's become a lot of other things that

906
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
are similar in structures so they're

907
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,240
probably isomers or other oxidative

908
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,558
degradings from that and it's you know

909
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,558
not the same are some of those allergens

910
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,398
sensitizers could they be irritating to

911
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,278
folks we do know that some of these

912
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,719
molecules may become ones like that but

913
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,720
we're not seeing you know everyone

914
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,558
present with tons of problems but you do

915
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,519
have some folks say i was irritated by

916
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,839
that that one bothered me um we don't

917
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,679
always know exactly why at a molecular

918
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,439
sense so again it's hard to say better

919
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,038
best or what's good or bad over which

920
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,038
method i think there's something for

921
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,558
everyone as long as we can consistently

922
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,079
produce it then we can start to

923
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:12,200
understand what might be right for which

924
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,199
types of consumers or patients

925
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,359
so um great question right it's a

926
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,278
vitamin estate bed we all know that for

927
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,558
sure are there others some states have

928
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:36,159
said mct because of lipoid pneumonia so

929
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,319
we know if you have like mineral oil

930
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,320
type ones really long chain fats and

931
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,558
fatty acids those might pool in the

932
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,558
lungs and you can't clear those

933
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,200
so you should stay away from things of

934
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,359
that type how long is that carbon chain

935
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,600
until you get there is a great question

936
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,479
mct you know if we're relatively

937
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,359
speaking mineral oil is like c40 and mct

938
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,960
can be like 9 to 12 or 15.

939
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,798
i don't know is that short enough to say

940
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,440
it's okay or is it still too long to be

941
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,278
a problem so i think the best approach

942
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,798
is saying what's in the plant how do i

943
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,720
use these things that people have been

944
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:11,119
inhaling and consuming before and try

945
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,880
and keep those in relative amounts that

946
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,479
are similar to the plant because i've

947
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,240
seen that be okay over the test of time

948
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,240
adding new things like that can be very

949
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,640
very tricky i think you know what's a

950
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,798
good solution to that we've seen other

951
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,080
states take out squalane and squalene

952
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:27,839
because they were concerned with some

953
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,119
cases of that

954
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,359
again i think it's going to be really

955
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,278
hard to say what's the best thing to put

956
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,519
in there other than what we've already

957
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,919
been seeing and could say hey this is

958
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,679
very close but you could say vitamin e

959
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,759
was fine and vitamin e acetate looks

960
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,080
very close and now it's not fine so

961
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,000
that's a very slippery delicate slope

962
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,000
and i think it's really really hard to

963
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,919
assess without a great toxicological

964
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,240
model which we really don't have yet

965
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,080
today so staying close to the plant

966
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,079
seems like the best place to start

967
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,879
sure

968
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,880
hi buddy

969
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,078
opinion of what

970
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,119
yeah so

971
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,358
um

972
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,440
are delta a products derived from cbd

973
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,799
safe or not and you know again with the

974
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,358
caution of what the word safe really

975
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,280
means so delta 8 i think is a fantastic

976
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,639
molecule it has a ton of therapeutic

977
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,720
benefits

978
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,119
maybe even a wider therapeutic window

979
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,519
than delta 9 because it has mitigated

980
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,679
psychoactivity for most folks but yet it

981
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:35,519
still has some obviously or we wouldn't

982
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,760
be talking about it

983
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,759
i think if you make that the right way

984
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,000
and you know all of your impurities in

985
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,839
that process it can be safe

986
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,918
is it currently being produced like that

987
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:48,239
out there today i don't think there's

988
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,960
many of that at all there might be some

989
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,559
but

990
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,480
i don't think that people are watching

991
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,159
what else is formed we've screened a few

992
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,240
of these things you see a lot of other

993
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,960
cannabinoid-like molecules that are like

994
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,959
there we don't know what they are

995
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,920
it's possible that you can have very

996
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,358
good clean safe delta eight products yes

997
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,519
i should be able to test them for heavy

998
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,960
metals pesticides residual solvents and

999
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,838
the gamut that we do for all the delta

1000
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,679
nine products but that's not required

1001
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,440
are folks actually doing that every time

1002
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,519
if someone checking that i don't you

1003
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,960
know i think that that's probably not

1004
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,880
i think of the delta eight space

1005
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,320
probably more like 2012 2010 california

1006
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,599
you know where like everyone's kind of

1007
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,838
doing whatever they want and no one's

1008
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,920
really checking um there's some

1009
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,519
laboratory efforts that say oh i think i

1010
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,000
saw this but there's been a lot of

1011
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,838
reports of well this folk this group

1012
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,960
said there was no delta nine but another

1013
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,799
lab looked at it and there was a

1014
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,240
considerable amount of delta nine

1015
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,119
because they were trying to say it was

1016
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:46,000
legal to let that go where whereas it

1017
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,519
really wasn't so i think the analysis is

1018
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,440
probably not really on par with all of

1019
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,199
those i think therefore i'm not seeing

1020
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,800
all the other cannabinoid derivatives

1021
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,358
that might be forming

1022
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,720
um and i think you can do it very well i

1023
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,838
just don't think there's a lot of that

1024
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,838
going on yet today

1025
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,358
for the terpene analysis no we only did

1026
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,119
those in the headspace samples so we did

1027
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,000
not try and put a pure terpene in like a

1028
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,519
vape cart um or on a dab nail and try

1029
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,199
and see some of that the strongen lab

1030
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,480
did a little bit of that with mercene

1031
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,679
and some other

1032
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,199
pure terpenes or a model cannabinoid

1033
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,480
composition

1034
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,078
but we didn't do any of that work

1035
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,760
directly ourselves putting a pure

1036
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,200
terpene in a vape car is actually a

1037
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,200
problem the viscosity is wrong and it

1038
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,439
flies right through it most of the time

1039
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:43,118
so they're not always built for that so

1040
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,119
that's going to be a little tricky i

1041
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,119
think

1042
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,839
very good question yes

1043
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,838
yep

1044
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,279
so with a vape card does my chemical

1045
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,358
composition that i actually have in the

1046
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,040
cartridge change over time

1047
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,559
yes it's very possible right because i'm

1048
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,639
heating those things and what

1049
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,799
temperature did i heat it to how hot did

1050
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,639
it get there how long was it i think a

1051
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,560
lot of us have probably experienced you

1052
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,279
know the end of this one seems a lot

1053
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,358
different than the beginning of that one

1054
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,960
so you can taste it in some respects

1055
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:24,559
that you know that there are changes

1056
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,480
what are all those changes what did they

1057
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,559
become i don't think that there's been

1058
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,719
much of any study on that just yet but

1059
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,039
that is important work to do because the

1060
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,159
lifetime of that being effective in

1061
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,960
terms of dosing and what you're

1062
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,920
delivering to patients or are i for am i

1063
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,159
forming

1064
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,079
um you know bad compounds that i

1065
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,639
wouldn't want to be inhaling in that

1066
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,960
respect that certainly is a theoretical

1067
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,559
possibility but i don't have any data or

1068
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,679
information to share specifically on

1069
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,759
that

1070
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,759
right question though

1071
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,760
sure

1072
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,519
okay great question

1073
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,119
are there any terpenes present in

1074
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,280
cannabis that if i heat them too much

1075
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,838
become carcinogenic compounds so we've

1076
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,480
seen things become benzene that's a

1077
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:21,119
carcinogen right so known carcinogenic

1078
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,199
properties of some of those degradants

1079
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,880
so yes technically the answer is yes do

1080
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,799
we see those at exceedingly large

1081
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,400
amounts that they could cause cancer are

1082
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,960
they overwhelmed by the anti-cancer

1083
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,320
properties of cannabis in general you

1084
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,720
know i i don't think we're seeing a lot

1085
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,960
of folks get cancer and dr tashkin did a

1086
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,279
nice metadata you know met a study that

1087
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,519
said we don't see lung cell carcinomas

1088
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,519
in people that smoke cannabis so while

1089
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,199
we're seeing these in the smokestream

1090
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,800
you know carcinogenic compounds that

1091
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,279
have formed via cannabinoids and

1092
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,680
terpenes being thermally degraded

1093
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,720
do we have a cause for alarm for causing

1094
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,319
cancer

1095
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,078
i think we would have seen you know a

1096
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,838
lot of chronic cannabis smokers having

1097
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,280
cancer of the airways the lungs and

1098
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,599
other things like you see with tobacco

1099
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,359
and we haven't seen that yet so they

1100
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,160
technically form are they at large

1101
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,078
enough concentrations now i can i can

1102
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,319
certainly say the rat gets cancer when i

1103
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,079
dunk it in a bucket of benzene but you

1104
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,599
know if i have a two molecules floating

1105
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,839
around it every other day does that

1106
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,440
cause cancer for it it's a you know a

1107
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,320
matter of dose that we get to in that

1108
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,800
regard um so technically they do but are

1109
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,519
they cause for cancer alarms i don't see

1110
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,519
that just yet

1111
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,059
maybe we'll go with the last one and

1112
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:32,130
then i'll let toby get up here

1113
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:32,130
[Music]

1114
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,000
sorry i didn't hear the first part of

1115
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,000
the question

1116
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,760
ah that's a good one that's a good

1117
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,598
that's a really good one um i probably

1118
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,520
lost like more sleep over this question

1119
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,079
than like any other cannabis question so

1120
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,759
if i had infinite resources i was the

1121
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,240
government oh my gosh

1122
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,560
um well now i can dream right what would

1123
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,959
we do about the naming game i think we'd

1124
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,440
all have to start tagging a code you

1125
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,039
know some sort of like large enough

1126
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,159
you know sequence of code that it would

1127
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,679
be always unique kind of like the

1128
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:14,239
blockchain and say

1129
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:16,159
this is what i meant by that and then

1130
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,159
capture it what we can in a snapshot in

1131
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,838
time to say well what did you mean and

1132
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,879
later do i have any of it to kind of

1133
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,039
fill in some of those gaps

1134
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,880
would we see you know

1135
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,719
possible groupings that come from that

1136
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,720
and say cool we can say that this has a

1137
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,879
little part of the code and then i can

1138
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,279
call it whatever i want so i think today

1139
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,358
a good step would be you know bob's blue

1140
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,040
dream right it's the branded version of

1141
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,039
whatever i wanted to call it so we don't

1142
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,119
want to do away with all the lineage and

1143
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,119
all the history that got us here there's

1144
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,039
some nice elements of that and it can be

1145
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,599
very informative to folks so you can't

1146
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,519
just scrap it and start over but we may

1147
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,960
transition to a place you know 50 years

1148
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,039
from now where no one really knew what

1149
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,199
blue dream was or cared much because now

1150
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,358
we have new names that say this is what

1151
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,439
it is how do we get there with this

1152
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,199
bridge maybe it's you know this brand's

1153
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,039
blue dream well hey when i had bob's

1154
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,118
blue dream it was different than bill's

1155
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,719
blue dream you know they both claim they

1156
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,480
started blue dream they swear they got

1157
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,879
the clones from the same guy and they

1158
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,559
very well may have but their production

1159
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,318
process and their nutrients and their

1160
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,639
way they grew it and how they did it and

1161
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,039
how they brought it to me in the store

1162
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:24,239
ended up causing two different effects

1163
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:26,800
so if i can brand and say i'm doing this

1164
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:29,118
consistently and i call this my blue

1165
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,480
dream i think that's a pretty good place

1166
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,960
to start today

1167
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,039
um and then if we like really said that

1168
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,800
has to go to the place that can test the

1169
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,318
daylights out of it store it so that if

1170
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,560
we learn how to test them later we can

1171
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:43,279
add those things to that info

1172
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,559
that might be a way to go about it but

1173
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,240
you'd probably have to be the government

1174
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,639
with large resources and the ability to

1175
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:51,118
say i can you know stockpile all

1176
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,920
all this cannabis for infinite times

1177
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,640
under cold conditions to do it

1178
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,960
thank you though very good fun question

1179
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:03,358
thank you again for your time

1180
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,440
[Applause]

1181
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:05,440
you
