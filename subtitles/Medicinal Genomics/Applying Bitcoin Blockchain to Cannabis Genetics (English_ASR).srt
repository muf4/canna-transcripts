1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,859
hello everybody today we're gonna be

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,898
talking about block chains and how these

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,580
are going to transform the cannabis

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,910
industry and why we're using them with

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,830
our strain seeking product offering

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,690
block chains present tremendous amount

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,339
of opportunity to the field and in order

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:20,399
for you to really I think understand

9
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,170
block change you have to suspend some of

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,799
your identity politics you have to put

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,510
all that aside and ask yourself you know

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,380
largely identity politics is arguing

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,079
over what a centralized piece of power

14
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,808
should do and with block chains you have

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,929
to stop and ask do you need it anymore

16
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:41,789
do you need a centralized a command and

17
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,799
control center governing this part of

18
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,179
the economy or can it be made obsolete

19
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,609
just like monarchs we're made obsolete

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:50,070
hundreds of years ago

21
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:52,320
so suspend all of your prior thinking's

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,600
on socio economics if you can for just a

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,219
brief moment and try to understand the

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,399
the magnitude and the gravity of what

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,649
this technology can do for people and

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,448
it'll be much easier for you to I think

27
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,540
to understanding and grapple with what's

28
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:08,728
going on here so what is Bitcoin well I

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,070
view things through my logical lens and

30
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,679
I I view Bitcoin as basically an

31
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,089
internet immune response it's an immune

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,200
response to something that's evolved

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,590
over the growth of the Internet the

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,750
growth of the Internet has over time

35
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,700
created very large centralized power

36
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,519
brokers and the internet that control

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,719
information and nothing's more true

38
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,840
about that when it comes to the actual

39
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,328
banking system we have large centralized

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,310
databases now that are dangerous by

41
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,349
design okay they are what we call honey

42
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,420
pots for hackers because they collect

43
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:42,658
large amounts of personal identification

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,320
information credit card information zip

45
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,000
codes and social security numbers all of

46
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,379
these things which contribute to over 40

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,049
billion dollars in credit card theft

48
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,969
every year and of course digital

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,439
identity theft is happening at record

50
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:57,929
paces in Currys a tremendous amount of

51
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,298
distraction waste in the economy much of

52
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,189
this is because there are economic

53
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,920
incentives to centralize this

54
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:07,488
information and bitcoin is changing that

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,689
it's creating an economic incentive to

56
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:12,900
decentralize information

57
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,939
and by doing so currency has emerged out

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,459
of this interesting that's interesting

59
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:20,189
technology okay so this honeypot problem

60
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,378
is critical to resolve in order for us

61
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:25,799
to move money around the internet if we

62
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:29,810
cannot be certain of the trust of where

63
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:32,849
data stays or stored we can never be

64
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,039
trusting a global internet ledger let's

65
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:37,289
say all right so Bitcoin solves this

66
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,359
problem by making a global ledger but

67
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,919
but creating a competition for people to

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,140
keep it alive and accurate all

69
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,389
throughout the globe the other the other

70
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,098
key thing that it does is it solve

71
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:48,839
something that's known as a digital or a

72
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:50,939
double spend problem just like with

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,579
Internet music it's easy to copy

74
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,318
Internet music over and over again well

75
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:57,420
how are we gonna make digital money if

76
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,729
it's easy to copy it if it can be copied

77
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,259
over and over again it can be subject to

78
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:03,389
attack like the Federal Reserve which

79
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,298
has been printing boatloads of money for

80
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:07,768
the last five years and that only leads

81
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,829
to hyperinflation and very dangerous

82
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,950
economic circumstances and fundamentally

83
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,169
robs the middle class and it makes

84
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,608
people poorer and enriches folks that

85
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:21,000
are really close to the printing press

86
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:23,329
okay so we can't have that in order to

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,419
have a good currency you need to have a

88
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:28,859
regulated or regulated by code issuance

89
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,359
if you will and that's what bitcoin is

90
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:33,780
built into the program it's going to

91
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:35,639
emit over 21 million bitcoins as rewards

92
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,049
for people who mined them all right

93
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,700
we're already at 16 million of these

94
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,709
bitcoins which is why the prices going

95
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,469
up exponentially because there is

96
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,939
reaching a scarcity part of the the

97
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:46,439
printing process but the printing

98
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,620
process won't complete itself until

99
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,689
21:40 okay and at that point there will

100
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,599
be transaction fees that will keep

101
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:56,519
miners incentivize timet to keep mining

102
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,439
this so what are miners you have to

103
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,409
understand why the miners mind and the

104
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:04,049
reason miner is mine is because bitcoin

105
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,628
is a competition for computers to solve

106
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,909
problems that and those and the proof of

107
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:10,709
those problems we've a lot of

108
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,818
cryptographic safety into the ledger if

109
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,699
you will what we'll touch on that

110
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,409
momentarily but you also have to step

111
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,139
back a little bit more globally and

112
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,909
realize what this has become ever since

113
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,468
2009 has been the best performing

114
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:24,718
currency global

115
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:26,218
forever since its existence and it's now

116
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:27,449
the largest computer network in the

117
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:29,519
world that's a thousand times larger

118
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,069
than the top 500 supercomputers combined

119
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,829
and that number is probably old it keeps

120
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,389
it seems to be keep going up every year

121
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:38,370
in terms of the number of computers that

122
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,250
are turning to this you'll see the the

123
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,649
network is measured in pedda hashes and

124
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,209
EXA hashes and more and more the

125
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:47,188
computers are turning their attention to

126
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:49,158
solving this problem because there are

127
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:52,050
very interest interesting economic

128
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:53,069
circumstances to be happiness what you

129
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,509
will find at this map are some

130
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,189
interesting nodes in Iceland and in

131
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,889
China and these are places where energy

132
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:01,680
is cheap because energy is really the

133
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:04,769
core ingredient behind Bitcoin mining

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,840
and this is what drives most the cost so

135
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:08,728
this has created a very interesting

136
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,560
symbiotic relationship that people have

137
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:14,128
to keep their eye on that power plants

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,839
that oftentimes would have to over

139
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:17,550
produce energy to match demand cycles

140
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,619
because you can't actually predict the

141
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,960
future you can't during search times

142
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,329
produce perfect synchrony a number of

143
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,068
electrons to your demand cycle you have

144
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:27,300
to always over produce energy according

145
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,740
to what you think your demands going to

146
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,650
be and a lot of times that energy is

147
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,610
wasted in heat and off gastón into the

148
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:34,829
environment

149
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,838
well Bitcoin miners have found a nice

150
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:39,778
symbiotic home with many power plants in

151
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:42,718
which case they can return some of that

152
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:44,908
wasted energy and thread it through ASIC

153
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:48,028
cards to mined bitcoins and effectively

154
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:49,918
produce a form of digital cash this is

155
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:52,408
waste getting turned into internet

156
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,378
security in this symbiotic relationship

157
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:59,158
with our energy sector and the internet

158
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:00,599
economy is creating the largest trusted

159
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,938
network of information in the world

160
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:05,128
right so this this is an evolutionary

161
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:07,319
force we've never seen before and the

162
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:09,960
rate at which it's growing is it's quite

163
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,180
hard bollock it is an exponential growth

164
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:16,348
pattern that we're seeing in in Bitcoin

165
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:19,050
and we see no signs of the stopping now

166
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:20,278
you have to consider if your hacker how

167
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,750
are you gonna attack this thing right

168
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:24,060
there's 10,000 nodes around the world

169
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,769
they have a tremendous economic interest

170
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,538
in making sure all the data is exactly

171
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:29,788
the same on all of these nodes so for

172
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:31,918
you to hack them you would have to hack

173
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:33,538
all of them simultaneously you're not

174
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,968
gonna be able to go down to Janet Yellen

175
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:36,709
and convince her to move the in

176
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:41,778
rates one way the other to help your

177
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:43,548
cause the this is not a group at the SEC

178
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:45,168
that might have a lot of buddies that

179
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:46,728
used to work at a former bank and they

180
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:49,548
come sometimes have a revolving door

181
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:51,949
between those roles and people start to

182
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:53,478
wonder whether the regulation is really

183
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,929
an accelerant of corporate power or

184
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:58,908
whether it's in fact doing its job as as

185
00:06:56,928 --> 00:07:00,828
a regulator who regulates

186
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:03,259
the regulator's when these things get

187
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:05,209
overly centralized well there's in the

188
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,829
case of Bitcoin the decentralization

189
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:09,319
means there's no one to bribe Lobby or

190
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:11,088
coerce you have to just earn your merit

191
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,509
on the network according to your CPU

192
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:16,189
cycles so this thing has a heartbeat now

193
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:17,179
this is how it works basically every ten

194
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:19,218
minutes

195
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:20,718
you get millions of global transactions

196
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:22,459
get pulled into a block and this block

197
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:25,998
is not officially part of the chain

198
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:27,649
until some magic is done on it and this

199
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:30,889
magic is what I would call a

200
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:34,999
cryptographic online sudoko competition

201
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:37,038
okay so this is a process where all of

202
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:39,349
these new blocks if they want to be

203
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,808
joined to the chain they have to be

204
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:44,238
cryptographically woven into that chain

205
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:46,039
and the way that weaving happens is

206
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:49,128
through a hashing process where they

207
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:51,139
computers compete to solve a hash with

208
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:53,028
an unknown set of characters added to it

209
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,300
so this is kind of like a Sudoku puzzle

210
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:58,158
and where the numbers of rows and

211
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,598
columns can be dynamically extended

212
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,118
according to how many computers are

213
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,519
competing on the problem so if let's say

214
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:06,709
a block happens to be solved in 15

215
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,478
minutes the computer code knows okay

216
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:10,548
make it a little easier so we try and

217
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,438
aim for 10 minutes and if it goes faster

218
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:14,088
down to down to 6 minutes it says okay

219
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,459
it's the computer capacity of the

220
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:18,348
network is is now too high we have to

221
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,389
adjust the difficulty add some rows and

222
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:22,158
columns to the stoical puzzle and see if

223
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,228
they can solve the problem and the first

224
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:25,879
one who does gets a reward now the

225
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:27,378
reason the Sudoku analogy is used in

226
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,209
here and it's not exactly what's going

227
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:30,649
on but the reason the analogy resonates

228
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,120
with a lot of people is that this is an

229
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:34,578
algorithm with a particular

230
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,990
characteristic that it is difficult to

231
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:38,028
solve but easy to verify

232
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,288
so no puzzles can take a long time to

233
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:40,490
solve but you just check the rows and

234
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,598
columns that they add up and you know

235
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,399
that and you can verify them very

236
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,139
quickly that's incredibly important for

237
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,480
the game theoretic so the network the

238
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,000
moment the first person finds a solution

239
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,000
all of the other minor

240
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,409
the network confirm that that solution

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,360
is correct and since it's easy to verify

242
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:58,449
they quickly move on to mining the next

243
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,740
block because the next reward the the

244
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,360
existing reward they're working on is

245
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,460
already been claimed they have to go now

246
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,870
compute the next one now the reward is

247
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,400
very important the reward right now is

248
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,080
12 and a half bitcoins which happens to

249
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,299
be about 60 grand every 10 minutes that

250
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,190
are being handed out for this prize this

251
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,929
reward means lots of computers want to

252
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,730
try and earn that 60 grand and they all

253
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,870
compete in what is known to be a

254
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,659
mathematical problem that's fairly

255
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,830
random in the computer which first hits

256
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,329
this is not us

257
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,820
you know intelligently code in any way

258
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,629
it's just really who can crunch the most

259
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,480
amount of flip as many bits as possible

260
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:32,409
on highly designed chips to get to the

261
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,370
answer the first and there's just

262
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:35,799
tremendous amount of luck involved

263
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,690
nevertheless you do this enough you'll

264
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,799
get lucky enough and on average miners

265
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,960
can predict their earnings and their

266
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,370
profitability based on how many of these

267
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,820
block awards that they're going to

268
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,500
recover in any given day so this creates

269
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,690
a tremendous amount of incentive for the

270
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,720
miners to continually mine and it also

271
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,160
means that you know every single block

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,259
that's been mined you know that it was

273
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,699
mined at this particular time stamp you

274
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,200
probably know that you can estimate the

275
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,610
cost of the energy at that time that

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,170
went into mining that block and the

277
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,639
amount of CPU cycles you know the

278
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,849
difficulty that was involved in other

279
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:08,110
words how big the stoical puzzle was so

280
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,060
every block is kind of itched with this

281
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,629
information about well this one required

282
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:16,149
so many watts of energy to produce and

283
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:18,039
if you wanted to remake this block and

284
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,419
change it well you've got all these

285
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,429
other computers in the network that

286
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,659
don't want to replicate a different

287
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:24,370
block they've all agreed and what that

288
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:26,289
block is it's been replicated all over

289
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,789
the network and so this becomes very

290
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:29,799
difficult to hack in fact if you wanted

291
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:32,709
to go back let's say 10 or 20 blocks to

292
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,059
change a value and redirect a million

293
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,180
dollars toward you instead of somebody

294
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:39,939
else you'd have to recompute all of

295
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:42,129
those ten blocks faster than the entire

296
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,360
network can do the next 10 minutes and

297
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,710
that's what that's what's really built

298
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,300
in the security of this thing is that

299
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,879
there isn't enough compute power on

300
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:51,159
earth to actually race this thing and if

301
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,509
you had that compute power you'd

302
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,610
probably be better off just mining

303
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:57,069
Bitcoin and earning some real money so

304
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,350
this kind of aligns people's interests

305
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,200
and creates what they call a game

306
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,040
theoretic to

307
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,320
to keep miners rewarded for bringing

308
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,579
Internet consistency and consensus on

309
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,629
the ledger okay it's called a

310
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:13,310
distributed consensus algorithm so this

311
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,470
you have to step back and roy's this

312
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:17,149
disrupts all industries just because it

313
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,470
has a source of money now that's stratum

314
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:22,419
for probably about seventy billion

315
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,529
dollars bigger than PayPal and and

316
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:26,899
Netflix and growing much faster than

317
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:28,309
both of those companies do you realize

318
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,919
once you can do this you can move stocks

319
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:33,649
and you don't need a Nasdaq you don't

320
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,779
need a centralized of reification center

321
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:38,350
that might be doing escrows and all of

322
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,850
these the stock market transactions

323
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,399
money suddenly becomes an app it's not a

324
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,379
central bank two to three billion people

325
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,730
that are unbanked today will be coming

326
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,240
into the economy shortly because they

327
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,539
just need a $25 cell phone to get banked

328
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,860
much cheaper than their previous hurdles

329
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:57,139
there's a six hundred billion dollars of

330
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,149
remittance remittances that move across

331
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:00,319
borders these are people who move out of

332
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,240
their country and want to send money

333
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,680
home well all that goes through channels

334
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,960
right now that are incredibly slow and

335
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,309
take 10 to 20 percent of the money you

336
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,180
can do this through Bitcoin with very

337
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:13,069
low very low fees and this has also led

338
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:15,229
to the largest global Kickstarter in

339
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,850
history with the the ICO market these

340
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:20,450
are initial coin offerings people are

341
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,250
now issuing their own crypto coins for

342
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,530
their companies so that people can buy

343
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,179
those and liquidate those much faster

344
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:28,039
than you can buy or liquid a traditional

345
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:31,609
private investment vehicles like private

346
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,679
company stocks this also becomes a form

347
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,570
of scarcity for digital content if you

348
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,250
have cryptographic keys on content then

349
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,070
you can move music around like this and

350
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,110
not have to worry about pirating there

351
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,620
are land titles that are going out of

352
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,509
the blockchain stocks media IP voting in

353
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,980
smart contracts smart contracts or

354
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:50,299
pieces of code that you can put in

355
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,980
certain block chains that are self

356
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:58,159
execution so if a executable and as a

357
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,950
result these can be can trigger other

358
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,870
things to own cars or in pay for cars

359
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,000
you can imagine cars actually owning

360
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,409
bitcoins and being able to if they can

361
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,840
drive themselves they can become

362
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:10,939
emancipated taxi cabs that figure out

363
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,580
how to pay for their own maintenance and

364
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,290
etc these days are coming with

365
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,000
that money is no longer tied to a person

366
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:20,299
it can actually be tied to any given

367
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,220
thing that can that can code so this

368
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,329
really read it redefines our

369
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,420
understanding of money and peer-to-peer

370
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,250
economies so mentioned IP in here so

371
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:30,110
what does this have to do with cannabis

372
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,580
well cannabis has a lot of these

373
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,710
cannabis patents that are emerging right

374
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,330
now and there's this big nasty strain

375
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,889
name game where no one believes what

376
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,259
strain is what so you go into a

377
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,299
dispensary and you don't see the typical

378
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,620
spreads that you might see in a liquor

379
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:44,209
store where you can have a hundred

380
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,190
dollar bottle of wine or a ten dollar

381
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,170
bottle of wine you don't get those

382
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,940
spreads in cannabis dispensaries because

383
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:52,610
nobody actually believes the labeling

384
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,960
systems and they shouldn't because if

385
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,300
you do any DNA sequencing the space

386
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,590
you'll realize it's all made up and

387
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:00,769
there's very little consistency between

388
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,269
people who claim one strain is some

389
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:03,710
Markey strain well quickly thereafter

390
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:05,120
people just start relabeling other

391
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,879
strains the strain that captures a

392
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,409
little bit more money in itself

393
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,070
equilibrate in the marketplace so we

394
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:15,620
don't have really good tools for proving

395
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,220
that aid trademark or given strain is is

396
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,210
what it is

397
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:23,269
and we know with wider legalization the

398
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,889
tools of traditionally doing this will

399
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,949
be utilized in the arm we're seeing

400
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,689
cannabis patents emerge and many more

401
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,810
who have emerged as this one there's one

402
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,920
for equatorial so towards the T the line

403
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:36,979
that even this patent has gotten even

404
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,209
broader and so these days are coming so

405
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,070
so what do you do

406
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,030
lots of cannabis patents are emerging

407
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,490
and you don't have the cash to

408
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:44,750
necessarily play the game of in the

409
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,789
gamble of a hundred thousand dollar

410
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,889
patents a lot of people look for defense

411
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:50,449
of IP which is exponentially cheaper and

412
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,399
probably more effective you'll see this

413
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:56,240
in a lot of companies like Twitter and

414
00:14:52,399 --> 00:15:00,259
in companies like Tulsa or Tesla they

415
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,659
are making different positions with with

416
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:05,419
their IP because the cost of IP these

417
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:07,909
days has been is kind of escalating yet

418
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:10,159
its longevity is kind of decaying pens

419
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:12,110
sometimes take 32 months to issue and

420
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,949
sometimes your patents extinct before

421
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:18,100
the time that it's up so defensive IP

422
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,560
seems to be another alternative

423
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,930
people who use our tools here use both

424
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,359
but nevertheless there is something in

425
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:27,129
the the plant patent statue known as a

426
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,899
prior use exemption clause so if you

427
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,929
have proof of business use one year

428
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:34,208
before the patents has issued and this

429
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:35,769
is like a grandfather clause so you can

430
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,088
basically demonstrate that hey I've been

431
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,470
using this in a business setting your

432
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:40,120
patent that just submarined on me

433
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,490
doesn't apply to me because I have proof

434
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,709
of prior use so how do you get that do

435
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,909
you Leafly and a picture on the internet

436
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,278
it's not gonna do it you really need to

437
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:49,389
get this thing notarized federal banks

438
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:50,830
are probably not a good place to go and

439
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:52,269
get this notarized and I wouldn't

440
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,129
suggest putting this necessarily federal

441
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:55,990
databases either because those have been

442
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:59,169
known to be shut down whenever the

443
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,850
government has a budget crisis you'll

444
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:02,199
notice the first things they turn off of

445
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,759
the things that people love like the

446
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,589
library of medicine and the national

447
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,480
parks those things are the first thing

448
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:10,959
ripped away from the people as opposed

449
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,480
to the you know the all types of the

450
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,708
military industrial things that are

451
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,930
being burnt that no one has any

452
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:19,958
visibility on now those won't stop but

453
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:21,789
yeah we'll take away the goods so those

454
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,559
databases we've seen disappear with this

455
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,549
this brings blockchains in the picture

456
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,859
saying why don't we store this

457
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:30,009
information on this global ledger that

458
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,050
is immutable and can't be taken down and

459
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,939
as a hundred and forty billion dollar

460
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:36,370
network of trust that that's

461
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,470
increasingly growing so that's what we

462
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,970
do with strain sake we have a genetic

463
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,680
profile it's recorded with a permanent

464
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,600
time stamp blockchain record it's

465
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,458
disaster-proof it's credentials can be

466
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,200
given to the customer this provides

467
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:49,539
legal proof of prior existence and

468
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,860
enables price exemption for submarine

469
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,569
patents and they're coming down the way

470
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,149
and just to contrast this with how we

471
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,870
used to do things the old way of doing

472
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:58,240
things

473
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,339
well we were always worried about the

474
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
asymmetric cost of invalidating a patent

475
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,380
two tends to fall on the entrepreneur

476
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,600
and that if you want to reexamine a

477
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,679
patent you're probably gonna spend

478
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,169
$100,000 or more in an ex-parte

479
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:14,140
reexamination and this happens all the

480
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:16,029
time where bunk patents get issued and

481
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,130
remain unchallenged because it's cheaper

482
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:19,899
to pay off the troll than it is to pay

483
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,990
the lawyers to do the invalidation

484
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,220
process all right so you also have to

485
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,078
keep in mind that the humankind is

486
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,880
doubling all of human data every four

487
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,259
months and so having a centralized

488
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,270
agency like the USPTO

489
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:34,240
trying to keep up with all of the

490
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:35,619
existing information that's in terms of

491
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,808
prior art this is a very difficult

492
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:39,849
problem and they are notorious at not

493
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,649
being incentivized to do it correctly if

494
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:44,079
they make mistakes you're still filing

495
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,548
them paperwork to to reverse those

496
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,359
mistakes they don't pay for the mistakes

497
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:48,609
you do

498
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:50,740
so the incentives aren't aligned

499
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,178
correctly here and so as a result we get

500
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,069
lots of patents that issue that are

501
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,130
bogus that you then have to dance around

502
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:58,839
as a small entity or come up with a

503
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,880
defense of IP strategy which is

504
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,609
oftentimes more effective and cheaper

505
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,500
the way we did this back in 2011 which

506
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:06,459
you know having known about Bitcoin we

507
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,589
would have probably done it differently

508
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,720
but at the time it went well aware of it

509
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,609
as we just filed a provisional patent to

510
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,870
the USPTO so they have it on record and

511
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:15,699
they can't miss it in a preliminary

512
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:17,139
search report and then abandon the

513
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,390
patent so we don't to pay for the rest

514
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,950
of the expenses of trying to get it to

515
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,520
have a questionable patent on jeans

516
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,558
being public we said I forget it let's

517
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:28,418
make it a open market here and have

518
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,950
freedom to operate this can be much

519
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:31,870
cheaper than having to prosecute a

520
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,429
patent all the way into existence and

521
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:35,579
then figure out how to actually police

522
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:38,019
that patent into a somewhat gray market

523
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:39,279
so the old way of doing things would

524
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,599
cost us more than two hundred thousand

525
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,589
dollars in sequencing cost and probably

526
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,539
more than twenty thousand dollars in

527
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:45,099
legal fees and resulted in an abandoned

528
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,349
patent on the cannabis genome so that

529
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:51,639
high THC strain should be in the open

530
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:52,298
domain here on forward now how do we do

531
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,650
this today

532
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,509
well we've gotten this down to be only

533
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,250
500 dollars in sequencing costs and 50

534
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,450
bucks in a Bitcoin transaction fee so

535
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,079
this is a foreigner next improvement

536
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,429
getting cannabis proof of existence

537
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,259
completed and we can now automate this

538
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:07,809
and do this for everybody so that your

539
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:09,519
strains end up being public of

540
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:12,039
defendable and you have proof of prior

541
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,460
use sitting on the link to the

542
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:15,099
blockchain

543
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,720
now we always encourage people to

544
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,939
download their own data so that you

545
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,289
replicate our version of this data yes

546
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,390
we have the timestamps in the blockchain

547
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:23,798
we cannot fit the entire DNA sequence

548
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,080
profile at bog chain because it's too

549
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:28,089
much data we just have a hash digest of

550
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,798
that data and so you have to keep the

551
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:32,589
source of that hash has to get

552
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,750
distributed and kept safe and so that's

553
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,490
on the customer they take those VCF

554
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,349
files and store them in other places I'd

555
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,048
recommend ipfs and other types of

556
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:42,289
encrypted distributed data stores but

557
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:43,940
nevertheless

558
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:46,250
hash is replicated all over the world

559
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,870
and that is what will what your fire

560
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,160
will always produce when you run shot to

561
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:50,899
the 56 on it and that's in the

562
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,570
blockchain the other thing we do is we

563
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,009
sequence 25 times more sequence than any

564
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,899
other sequence provider out there we're

565
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:58,549
sequence 3.2 million bases this is an

566
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,410
important number to ask because if it's

567
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:01,940
a very low number of bases or sequencing

568
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,430
well you really don't know whether

569
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,660
something's unique so more bases the

570
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,490
better eventually this will be whole

571
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,680
genome shotgun you get about 50,000

572
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,539
snips off of it we also tie all 34

573
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,730
cannabinoid into 13 genes in the process

574
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:16,250
and we run this rosetta stone snip panel

575
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,329
so that you can triangulate our data

576
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:22,220
with everything else that's been put

577
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:24,289
public to date so MGC genomics Euler and

578
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,480
Lynch and Philo's have all put hundreds

579
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,129
of strains public but none of them have

580
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,480
sequenced them with the same methods and

581
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,370
so none of that data can be crossed

582
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,930
compared the only thing that can cross

583
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:34,489
compare them is this rosetta stone that

584
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,200
we've built which sequences hundreds of

585
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:38,210
snips across all of the same low-side

586
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,920
that they've all published before and so

587
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,289
now we can uniquely play something in

588
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,519
the tree no one else can do this if

589
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:44,960
they're sequencing for you they don't

590
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,879
know whether their stuff is unique in

591
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,410
our database and whether it is unique in

592
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,510
all the other public databases so

593
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,250
they're just giving you a sense that

594
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:53,839
you're unique based on their own private

595
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,519
database and this is no longer gonna

596
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,139
remain private this whole field is gonna

597
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,700
go blockchain and it's gonna be public

598
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,930
and they'll be distributed Ledger's of

599
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,130
cannabis IP and genetics circulating we

600
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,990
do this for several years and there's

601
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,540
already hundreds and hundreds of strains

602
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,940
that have been have been fingerprinted

603
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:13,309
into the blockchain this also gives you

604
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,750
a relationship to all the other samples

605
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:16,429
out there I'm a teacher what things to

606
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,769
breed with gives you this indelible

607
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,450
timestamp and you get a nice page

608
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:21,710
published at canopy dia to show off your

609
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,930
strain with all the cannabinoid

610
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,289
interpreting profile information hosted

611
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,670
there with the blockchain information so

612
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:30,649
if you want to learn more about these

613
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,590
types of things please join us at kin

614
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,300
met we're always intersecting these wild

615
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:39,139
at different fields with the cannabis

616
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:41,659
field so and with that please leave any

617
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:45,220
comments or questions below and we will

618
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,220
get to them as we can thank you
