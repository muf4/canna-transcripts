00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:19,320
what is your process for for adding new

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,159
products that like new cannabinoids into

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,160
your

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,560
portfolio yeah um we got a big pipeline

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,320
you know the wish list is Big um um we

7
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:32,640
have prototypes and so you know things

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,320
that I find uh interesting based on

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,200
pre-clinical literature based on what

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,799
people are telling me we usually make a

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,320
prototype and share it around with the

12
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,439
staff and with myself and some of our

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,359
colleagues and see what people think you

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,280
know a good example of this is our I

15
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:53,759
think it's our newest product still it's

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,719
a a combination of cbda and cbga so cbga

17
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,079
like who knows anything about cbga you

18
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,518
look in the peer rreview literature

19
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,198
there's so little on it um you know a

20
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,679
few few more hits just this past year

21
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,359
but it's is it is it similar to CBG

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,080
which we also don't know that much about

23
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,400
but we know more is it different than

24
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,039
CVG you know a lot of unknowns there but

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,560
there was this um you know preclinical

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,118
study that gained a lot of headlines

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,920
about how it could inhibit the SARS Cove

28
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:25,159
2 virus in its infectious potential in

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,240
mice and in cells and so we thought well

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,000
you know we've seen such impressive

31
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,359
results with the acidic canabo the thca

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,239
and the cbda it kind of makes sense for

33
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:37,799
us to explore cbga next let's see what

34
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:40,919
it does we started playing around with

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,240
it and we found that in combination with

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,640
cbda it seemed to be doing something

37
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:48,239
special um you know we weren't testing

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,359
it against SS you know like against

39
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,478
covid uh we were just taking it and see

40
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,280
how we felt and people were reporting

41
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:58,078
very similar things that this comination

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,640
made them feel alert awake focused like

43
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,438
in the zone resilient to addess you know

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,200
I didn't expect that I still don't

45
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,318
exactly know what's the mechanism of

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,920
action um but enough of us felt like

47
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,399
well this is a prototype worth bringing

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,079
to Market that you know that's what we

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,760
did and we still have so much to learn

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,080
from it you know I mean even even CBG I

51
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,280
knew it had a lot of potential what do

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,440
we know about it in humans right now

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,800
other than the anecdotes almost nothing

54
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,840
right there's one survey study and the

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,120
people in that study weren't you know

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,800
that the data is um just not very clear

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,439
like it's a good starting point but we

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,000
don't know exactly how much most of them

59
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,199
were taking or what what other you know

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,039
canav oids they were taking it for uh

61
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,719
and and so because of that we currently

62
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,519
have an ongoing uh another survey of CBG

63
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,400
users to try to to try to clarify that

64
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,760
but what it it seems like you get you

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,840
get something that's a hit in a small

66
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:58,000
number of people you allow other kind of

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,640
cannabis uh enthusiasts to to start

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
using it and then before too long we've

69
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,079
got got some signals that are worth

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,639
following and we do the observational

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,360
research we kind of confirm what we

72
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,518
think we're seeing and then you know

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,159
maybe that leads to more more clinical

74
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,680
trials or more animal

75
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,560
research it's you know it's so backwards

76
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,360
with cannabis that we start with humans

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,799
and then we go

78
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,799
to after

79
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:31,679
[Music]

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
that

81
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,239
ah
