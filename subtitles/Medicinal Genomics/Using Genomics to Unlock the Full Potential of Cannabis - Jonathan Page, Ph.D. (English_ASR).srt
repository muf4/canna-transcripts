1
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:11,298
well I'll begin by thanking Kevin and

2
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:12,859
Doug and the organizers for the

3
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:15,829
opportunity to speak it's nice to be

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:17,448
back here I was at can med I guess a

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,028
year and a half ago or something in

6
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:21,800
Boston and it was a lot smaller than

7
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:23,719
this so it's great to see the growth the

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,719
growth in the cannabis area in general

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:29,538
so we're switching gears from earlier

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,019
talks which were focused on on humans

11
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:36,800
and medicine and and disease states to

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:39,470
the plant itself and so I've sort of

13
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,629
tailored my talk to speak specifically

14
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:43,250
about genomics I'm not going to talk too

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,190
much about the plant other than to say

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,689
you know this is an amazing organism

17
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:50,629
that we're talking about with cannabis

18
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:53,809
it's used it's has been used for

19
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,090
thousands of years maybe going on 10,000

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,679
years by humans for very diverse

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,930
purposes so there's no other plant

22
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,359
species I think that humans sort of

23
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:04,308
access widely that is both a source of

24
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,828
food and the you know that pile of hemp

25
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:09,048
seeds that I show on the slide source of

26
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:13,309
fiber so there's bast fiber in the in

27
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:15,230
the stems of cannabis that is very you

28
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,230
know high tensile strength and used for

29
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,790
clothing and fishnets and it's and of

30
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,170
course it's a medicine because that's

31
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,170
what we're talking about here today and

32
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,640
by medicine I mean you know it can

33
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,379
actually treat disease or alleviate

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,299
disease but it's also a drug it's a

35
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,579
social drug and the picture on the

36
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:34,969
bottom left which I sort of scooped off

37
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:37,370
a paper that Ethan Russo published a

38
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:39,260
while ago is actually a shamans grave

39
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,228
from western China think it's something

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,969
like 2700 years ago that this individual

41
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:46,609
was was buried with a whole bunch of

42
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:49,459
grave Goods and something like 740 grams

43
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:52,189
of dried cannabis flour so this is a you

44
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:55,459
know a plant that humans have have

45
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:58,429
already utilized going back that far for

46
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:04,069
it's it's chemistry like THC and other

47
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:06,290
cannabinoids so what my lab is done for

48
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:10,250
for a while now is is really focused on

49
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:12,950
cannabis as a producer of unusual

50
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,620
chemicals so my my trajectory as a

51
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:18,259
researcher was from trying to understand

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,140
cannabinoid biosynthesis so the the

53
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,818
biochemical

54
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,449
pathways by which cannabinoids are

55
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:27,060
formed actually I'll go back one and

56
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:29,879
that led more and more to be involved in

57
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,159
genomics and in in 2011 I was part of a

58
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,199
Canadian team that published the first

59
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,659
cannabis genome it was actually the

60
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,149
first medicinal plant for which a genome

61
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,770
was was known there was about 22 other

62
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,870
plant genomes known at the time but

63
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:47,100
these were things like weed and cotton

64
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,450
and soybean etc cannabis was was really

65
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,609
a medicine in it

66
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:54,060
it's a genome that's pretty standard

67
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:58,890
it's about 820 mega base pairs so not

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:03,090
not huge but relatively complex and we

69
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:04,829
actually sequenced a cultivar or what we

70
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,530
were in the day calling a strain called

71
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,050
purple cush that we we obtained the

72
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,969
leaves for the the sequencing from a

73
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,709
medical cannabis patient in Vancouver

74
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,719
British Columbia who was growing it for

75
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,489
himself so it wasn't you know a big sort

76
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,949
of corporate Enterprise at the time and

77
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,830
he gave or donated a handful of leaves

78
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,959
that we isolated the DNA from so that

79
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,600
has been an extremely successful project

80
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,969
at the same time it's it's commits very

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,430
incomplete the genome is fragmented it

82
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:34,139
gave people the raw materials to do

83
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,510
further analyses but it's certainly not

84
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,889
finished but in in today's talk I'm

85
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,539
gonna highlight a couple of areas that

86
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,548
we've actually what we've used the

87
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,530
genome for and I guess where I'm trying

88
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:44,969
to go here is that you know sequencing a

89
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,250
genome is one thing it churned out a

90
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:50,370
bunch of data you make it available you

91
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,259
you do a lot of computational work but

92
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,789
it's really the raw materials for other

93
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:59,699
science so one of the things the key one

94
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:01,859
question number one that we tackle both

95
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,479
with the genome and and before that was

96
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,030
trying to figure out how cannabinoids

97
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,759
and torpedo formed in the plant so this

98
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,430
is you know how does THC acid or

99
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,810
cannabidiol ik acid or Mir seen or beta

100
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,879
carry awfully and on the terpene side

101
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,269
how are they actually made what are the

102
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,728
genes that control their production and

103
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:23,370
the way we did that was was actually

104
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:26,159
twofold one of them was one approach was

105
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,870
to focus in on the plant structures that

106
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,120
make cannabinoids so these are the

107
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,069
glandular trichomes that are found on

108
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,790
the female floral tissue so female

109
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:35,430
flowers are the

110
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,460
by the the flower that people smoke or

111
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,900
extract they're rich in cannabinoids and

112
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,849
the reason they're rich in cannabinoids

113
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,649
is because cannabinoids are not just

114
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,030
made in the leaves or in green material

115
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:50,909
they're actually made in these little

116
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:53,639
disks of cells that are underlying a

117
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,260
resin droplet on the top of a tri coma

118
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,550
trichome is like a microscopic hair I

119
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,599
mean you can see it with your eyes but

120
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,670
it looks like a little bit of a sort of

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,790
shiny crystally thing on a plant surface

122
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,800
we took those those cell types those

123
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,620
specific cell types of trichomes and

124
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,470
analyzed the gene expression in them

125
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,949
using DNA sequencing technology that was

126
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,260
available in the day and we were able

127
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,969
together with a lot of classical

128
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,889
biochemistry a lot of you know that sort

129
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,960
of grunt work that grad students are in

130
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:27,479
in the lab at midnight doing to really

131
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:29,399
figure out all of the enzymes and the

132
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,050
genes that encode those enzymes that are

133
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,209
present in the cannabis genome so we

134
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,030
from the sort of basic building blocks

135
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:38,489
of plant metabolism down to the finished

136
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:40,679
end products that an audience like

137
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,600
attending can met here is interested in

138
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,110
things like cannabidiol ik acid which is

139
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,180
the precursor to CBD now we know how

140
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,120
those are formed and that was really the

141
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,120
power of genomics the in in particular

142
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,040
cannabis chromatic acid CBCA which is on

143
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,500
the bottom right of the of the slide

144
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,390
there we actually didn't look at the

145
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,519
trichomes we analyzed the genome in its

146
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:06,870
entirety to find that enzyme so that was

147
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:10,769
one sort of success story we similarly

148
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,540
and I've heard that voice of the time

149
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:14,250
limit the voice of God so many times I

150
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,030
actually drop slides from my talk today

151
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:21,029
but similarly we've done biochemical

152
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,759
work using the purple cush genome to

153
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:26,189
figure out how the terpenes for which

154
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,469
cannabis is well known as well how the

155
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:30,389
terpenes are formed what are the enzymes

156
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:34,050
that make terpenes and we ended up

157
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,550
having basically all of the metabolites

158
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,379
that are labeled I'll not slide though

159
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,410
the major cannabinoids like cannabidiol

160
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:42,779
ik acid can bridge or aaalac acid THC

161
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,040
acid can of achromatic acid and the

162
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,629
Manger monoterpenes

163
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,740
and these are the compounds that Ethan

164
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,810
Russo was talking about

165
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,670
well things like Betty carry awfully and

166
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,920
mere scene and pining we have all of

167
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:57,900
those enzymes and that's from genomics

168
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:00,449
the other thing we did with our genome

169
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,399
is is moved away from the biochemistry

170
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,680
for which my lab was sort of established

171
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,279
and really focused on the evolution of

172
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,379
the plant

173
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:12,599
what is the Jeannette genetic structure

174
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:14,159
of cannabis and by genetic structure I

175
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,870
mean what are the relationships amongst

176
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,040
all these different types of cannabis

177
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:23,209
that we have so we know that drug type

178
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:26,069
cannabis and hemp are different I heard

179
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:28,859
various conversations around CBD from

180
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:32,759
hemp and CBD from cannabis it's the same

181
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,970
plant it's the same species they're

182
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,589
inter fertile so cannabis the drug form

183
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,770
whether it's called marijuana or

184
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:44,849
cannabis or drug type cannabis and hemp

185
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:46,919
are grown and and really bred for

186
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:50,250
different purposes so hemp is a source

187
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,590
of those seeds and fiber for which I

188
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,660
sort of showed in the first slide while

189
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:56,489
marijuana or drug type cannabis is for

190
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,650
the production of cannabinoids like THC

191
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:02,030
and CBD but they're very they're very

192
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:04,949
similar sort of morphologically

193
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,929
certainly hemp is a lot more sort of

194
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,610
scraggly looking plant if you drive past

195
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,439
the hemp field and we have about a

196
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,509
hundred thousand acres of hemp grown in

197
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,000
Canada each year it's not as sort of

198
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,920
pristine beautiful crop like you see in

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,610
a modern medical cannabis production

200
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,740
system but they're the same plant within

201
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,580
drug type cannabis of course we have

202
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,230
this sort of you know this canonical

203
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:31,469
classification which I actually think is

204
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,600
is is probably not that meaningful but

205
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,720
the classification is that drug type

206
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,090
cannabis is divided into indica style

207
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,240
plants or type plants and sativa type

208
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:45,149
plants indica type plants would be sort

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,639
of shorter stockier broader leaflets and

210
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:51,360
with a more of a sedative or sort of

211
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:53,340
body stone versus sativa taller sort of

212
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,039
lanky or more open flowering plant

213
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,920
narrower leaflets and with a sort of

214
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,269
stimulating or cerebral effect and this

215
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,099
is what you know

216
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,409
you're in a dispensary in Vancouver

217
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,960
where I'm from or going online in

218
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:08,969
California or wherever you are people

219
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,490
classified drug type cannabis marijuana

220
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,920
type cannabis into these types and they

221
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,919
also describe a third type the hybrid

222
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,899
the mix of the two so that that's sort

223
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:20,849
of how we think about cannabis broadly

224
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,429
and then of course we have this kind of

225
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,670
this crazy chaotic world of cannabis

226
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:29,219
strains or cultivars or chemo bars white

227
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:31,469
widows Sour Diesel Jack Herer Kevin dog

228
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,410
what-have-you these are these have been

229
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,920
sort of I would say haphazardly named in

230
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:39,779
many cases by the people who sprouted

231
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,159
the seed or got a clone from their buddy

232
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,559
and really enjoyed and gave it a new

233
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:47,490
name so what we tried to do with our

234
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:50,039
genomics work was used genotyping that

235
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,690
is the ability to sort of analyze the

236
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,259
the genetic differences between

237
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,120
organisms using a scan sequencing

238
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,759
technique so we didn't sequence every

239
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,100
single piece of DNA in in the plants we

240
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:07,350
we scan just sort of the sort of high

241
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:10,560
points and we got 43 samples of DNA from

242
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,750
from hemp types an eighty one drug type

243
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,729
or marijuana type samples and we

244
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,190
analyzed them using a technology called

245
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:20,580
genotyping by sequencing and what this

246
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,550
gave us was a dataset of about 14,000

247
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,820
single nucleotide polymorphisms or snips

248
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:29,459
these would be individual genetic DNA

249
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,710
code differences between those samples

250
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,230
and this was in what I say we this was

251
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,330
in collaboration with a population

252
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,240
geneticist at Dalhousie University named

253
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,190
Sean miles and then we crunch that data

254
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,529
that oh really the problem moves away

255
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,900
from a plant problem or DNA sequencing

256
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:49,860
problem into a statistical problem and

257
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,929
and what we used was or at least as we

258
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,509
visualize the data here shown as a

259
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:56,159
principal component analysis we found

260
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:58,620
that there was one group that sort of

261
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,269
upper right-hand group in green that was

262
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,970
the heme type they were very broadly

263
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:05,159
separated from drug type cannabis which

264
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,930
suggests again you know they the banks

265
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,669
he backs up what we already know they're

266
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:10,439
grown for different purposes they might

267
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,569
have even originated from different sort

268
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,460
of gene pools but within the drug type

269
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,080
we found some

270
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,450
relationships but it was a sort of a

271
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,240
larger more spread-out group and then

272
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,129
when we dug in more closely what we were

273
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,490
trying to do was correlate what we

274
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:29,350
called the reported ancestry so the

275
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,889
percentage of indica our percentage of

276
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,750
sativa as described by the grower or the

277
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:37,090
seed company that provided the sort the

278
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,190
sample with what the genetic type said

279
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,440
and the r-squared the correlation

280
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:44,800
between reported ancestry and genotype

281
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,020
was 0.36 so it's a you know low to

282
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,359
moderate correlation in other words

283
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:51,309
there wasn't a lot of evidence to

284
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,889
support genetic differences between

285
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:55,839
indicas and sativas as they were

286
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:59,409
described by the people who grow those

287
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,410
plants so I think what were what we're

288
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:05,019
sort of exposing here is you know the

289
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:07,719
inaccuracy of that indica sativa

290
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:09,669
dichotomy but what I don't suggest is

291
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,860
that it doesn't mean there's thought

292
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:13,659
they're subject not subjective

293
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,450
differences between cannabis types

294
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:18,579
people clearly see that whether it's

295
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,620
medical or recreational use and there

296
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,600
are more sedative types and more

297
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,690
stimulating types but it's just that the

298
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,790
genetic identity and then the also the

299
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,190
ability of the grower or the process or

300
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,959
the dispensary to give you information

301
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:40,180
around that is not not really unfirm

302
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:42,790
footing so I'll go back one slide what's

303
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:45,479
next for cannabis genomics I think what

304
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:48,459
we're going to see now is a movement

305
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,889
towards using genomics to fast-track

306
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:54,040
breeding we've had this you know

307
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:56,080
wonderful plant it's widely grown

308
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,759
probably every continent I'm not sure

309
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,690
about Antarctica but I'm sure someone

310
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:04,419
has tried to to cultivate it there but

311
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,150
it's been really kept out of labs you

312
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:10,599
know in universities governments larger

313
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:12,250
corporations its improvement has been

314
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,720
limited to this sort of underground

315
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,970
breeding world which has has to be

316
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,519
applauded for its these amazing success

317
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,980
in increasing THC levels and bringing

318
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,509
CBD back but it hasn't solved some of

319
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,420
the problems things like you know

320
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:28,179
powdery mildew is a widespread fungal

321
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:30,879
pathogen outdoors continues to be tchau

322
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:33,609
in different latitudes really what we

323
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,669
need is a genomics to accelerate crop

324
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:39,669
improvement and so I just just to finish

325
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:41,610
my talk I sort of highlight three areas

326
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:44,799
where I think this kind of new wave of

327
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:47,560
cannabis science driven by genomics is

328
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,599
going to to move things along for our

329
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,329
both our industry and for the use of

330
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,580
cannabis one is its a potential

331
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,950
resolution for this strain chaos problem

332
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,379
in the sense that you know we need trust

333
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,259
in the industry we need more predictable

334
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:03,820
effects for patients and consumers we

335
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:06,460
need a better understanding at a purely

336
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,740
scientific level of how cannabis evolved

337
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,110
so I think by applying more genetics

338
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,049
getting more samples doing more in-depth

339
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:17,320
analyses we're probably going to be able

340
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:19,059
to link you know a name and I think

341
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,260
humans are always going to want a name

342
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,299
they're not going to want a list of

343
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,980
chemicals they're gonna want a name you

344
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:26,079
know whether we have Merlot grapes and

345
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,970
we have Honey Crisp apples and we have

346
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,350
Dalmatian dogs and we name those things

347
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,450
and I think we're going to continue to

348
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,879
name kanima's but we need some genetic

349
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,550
identity that backs that up as I

350
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,590
mentioned before genetic markers are

351
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:40,809
going to accelerate breeding things like

352
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:43,180
flowering traits disease resistant

353
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:47,799
traits specialized chemistry's I heard

354
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:49,689
th CV mentioned earlier CBG I mean we we

355
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:51,579
want to drive towards breeding and

356
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,530
providing plants that have chemistry

357
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,030
that helps patients also has

358
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:58,870
recreational properties that are

359
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:01,299
desirable three minutes the last point

360
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,340
and I think you know this is already

361
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:06,129
being worked on in the industry is that

362
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:09,160
you know we we have sort of generally

363
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:11,110
sort of two tools or have had two tools

364
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,000
in planned improvement one is

365
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,980
traditional breeding the other is

366
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,539
genetic modification now we have a sort

367
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,730
of a third way which is genome editing

368
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:20,679
that's using specialized and

369
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,879
revolutionary techniques called CRISPR

370
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:27,309
casts and related approaches to actually

371
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,710
make changes in genomes whether it's an

372
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:32,439
animal genome or a plant genome towards

373
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,420
a desirable outcome and I think you know

374
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,000
now cannabis is finally sort of coming

375
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:40,269
out of the closet as an organism that

376
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,659
that labs can work on we will see the

377
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:44,419
application of this technology

378
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:46,339
fairly soon is a GMO or not I mean the

379
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:47,569
EU says one thing in North America says

380
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,710
something else so it's a bit of a debate

381
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:54,110
but I think this is coming as well and

382
00:15:51,710 --> 00:16:05,629
with that I'll end and there's time for

383
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:07,310
questions I'll take some thanks there's

384
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:10,250
microphones for questions in the front

385
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:11,809
of the room please step up if you have a

386
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:22,129
question yeah I think you need to go to

387
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:25,429
the mic at the hi John thanks for coming

388
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:29,419
today I wanted to find out more

389
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:33,049
specifically what kind of markers what

390
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:35,419
low sigh you are beginning to find

391
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:40,309
disease resistance for instance and

392
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:44,329
possibly the autoflowering traits one

393
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:46,729
minute yeah so you know I partly now a

394
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,550
lot of my work is more of a commercial

395
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,879
nature so I'm sort of a bit hesitant to

396
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:55,279
other than to say you know flowering

397
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,159
time control is a key area that we're

398
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,079
detecting in in our work and disease

399
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,659
resistance specifically around botrytis

400
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,200
and powdery mildew I think are huge

401
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:08,480
drivers of crop maybe not lost but loss

402
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:17,630
of value so we're working on those two

403
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:20,720
as well actually there's no GMO I mean

404
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,970
like but in terms of CRISPR I don't

405
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,910
think it's GMO because the changes made

406
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,289
those genome editing technique is the

407
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,990
same thing that would happen naturally

408
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:32,059
with with mutation or you could induce

409
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,279
it with a chemical or radiation so I

410
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:36,379
think it's safe to say it's not GMO in

411
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:37,549
terms of the idea that we have GMO

412
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,090
cannabis already

413
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:42,769
there's no GMO cannabis I mean may exist

414
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:44,959
the lab but it's not something that's

415
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:47,240
that's out in the in the wild in terms

416
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,440
of production or anything so I don't

417
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,440
think we have to worry about that yet
