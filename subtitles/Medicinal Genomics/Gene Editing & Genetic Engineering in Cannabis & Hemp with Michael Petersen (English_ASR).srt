Welcome to the Canad Coffee Talk podcast

3
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,000
where we talk with the leading minds in

4
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:25,039
cannabis science, medicine, cultivation,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,920
and safety testing. I am your host, Ben

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,480
Amalt. I am the senior marketing manager

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,920
at medicinal genomics and proud member

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,039
of the team that puts on the CANMED

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:40,800
summit. Speaking of CANMED 25, we are

10
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,359
less than 80 days away from the event.

11
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,199
So, if you are planning to join us in

12
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,799
Puerto Rico this June, don't wait to

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,520
register. Our room block at the Windham

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,479
Resort is filling up fast and you do not

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,879
want to miss out. I believe we are about

16
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:01,759
70% full at the moment. Also, flights to

17
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:05,198
Puerto Rico are going to go up in price

18
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:08,719
as we get closer to the event. So, book

19
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:11,679
now and save a little money. Speaking of

20
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:15,280
saving money, I do have a promo code

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,080

both the private and public plant

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,879
biotech space. He has over 50 issued

49
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,759
patents and his work in plant

50
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:38,079
transformation and gene expression is a

51
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:40,318
passion. Mike has worked on many genetic

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,599
engineering and gene editing contracts

53
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:47,119
with entities across the globe. and now

54
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,839
he focuses on innovative hemp research.

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,800
At KMED2, Mike will share his team's

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,360
latest efforts to transform cannabis and

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,280
hemp plants using gene editing and

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,280
genetic engineering in a presentation

59
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,598
titled creation of novel traits through

60
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,318
genetic engineering and editing of

61
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,598
canabonoid tarpine and flavonoid

62
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:12,318
pathways in cannabis sativa.

63
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,238
He'll also be participating in the KMED

64
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,958
genomics workshop along with other

65
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,480
experts in plant

66
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,039
genomics. During our conversation, we

67
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,158
discussed the differences between gene

68
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,439
editing and genetic

69
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:29,598
engineering, how gene editing and

70
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,799
genetic engineering methods have changed

71
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,759
over the years, potential applications

72
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,200
of gene editing and genetic engineering

73
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:42,318
in cannabis and hemp. the benefits and

74
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,479
challenges versus traditional breeding

75
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,119
and the Wisconsin Crop Innovation C

76
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,959
Center's gene editing service, which is

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,080
available to researchers and

78
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,000
cultivators. Before we get to my

79
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,959
conversation with Mike, I'd like to

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,560
thank this episode sponsor,

81
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,719
canipedia.net. Canopedia.net NET is the

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,360
world's most comprehensive cannabis

83
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,560
genomic library, featuring more than

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,040
2,200 genomic reports on cannabis and

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,319
hemp varieties from around the globe.

86
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,959
Canopedia.net reports are easily

87
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,839
searchable and contain visualizations

88
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,439
and variant tables that highlight high

89
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:26,079
impact variants in genes of interest.

90
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,639
For example, you can see a report for

91
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,519
the Badger G variety that Mike

92
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,560
Peterson's team edited to break the CBD

93
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,680
synthace gene. In fact, you can actually

94
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,439
see the dropout in the CBDA coverage

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,918
chart on that report, which is pretty

96
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:46,319
cool. Visit

97
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:46,319
canopedia.net. That's

98
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:56,959
kn.net today to learn more.

99
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,600
Okay. And without any further ado,

100
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,620
please enjoy my conversation with Mike

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:13,300

103
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,319
Good afternoon, Mike. Thanks so much for

104
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,319
joining us on the podcast. Hi, Ben.

105
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,038
Thanks for having me. excited to talk

106
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,680
with you today about gene editing and

107
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,839
genetic engineering in cannabis and hemp

108
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,560
plants. Uh, as I was telling you before,

109
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,119
it's an exciting topic, a controversial

110
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,079
topic, and probably a misunderstood

111
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,360
topic. So really excited to have you on

112
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,079
here to talk through some of these

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,600
things and um really give a nice preview

114
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,639
for the information that you're going to

115
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,720
be sharing this June in Puerto Rico as

116
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,800
part of CAMED 25 where you're going to

117
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,360
be sharing a lot of the work that you

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
and your team are doing on this topic

119
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,199
and you're also going to be a part of

120
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,879
our genomics workshop talking about

121
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,560
advanced breeding techniques. So we're

122
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,000
super excited about that as well. I'm

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,800
glad that we're keeping you busy.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,399
Um, but uh before we get into sort of

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,840
the nitty-gritty here, I want to give

126
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,758
you an opportunity to share a bit about

127
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,839
your background and how you became

128
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,560
interested in cannabis and hemp

129
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,478
research. Sure, sounds good. Um, just

130
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,120
first off, I I really look forward for

131
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,199
CANMED 25. Last year was my first year

132
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,639
at CAM Med. Uh, and it was really

133
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,319
exciting. Really good conference. Lots

134
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,160
of good science, uh, lots of medical

135
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
stuff. So yeah, really looking forward

136
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,039
to uh sharing what I what our my team's

137
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,038
been doing in the last uh year up here

138
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,839
at uh Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center.

139
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:41,038
So uh but a little bit about myself. Um

140
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:44,079
I've been in the you know the the the

141
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,800
genetic engineering or molecular biology

142
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,279
uh all my all my career. So 35 plus

143
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
years. Uh I graduated from the

144
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,318
University of Wisconsin Madison with a

145
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,680
bacteriology degree. uh joined a a small

146
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
startup right here in Middleton,

147
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,560
Wisconsin, just outside of Madison,

148
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,719
where back in the early 80s, we were

149
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,639
basically really just trying to

150
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,440
understand how we could genetically

151
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,160
engineer plants or put genes into plants

152
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,839
to to make new traits or to enhance

153
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,199
traits that were that were already

154
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,318
there. Um, so spent a number of years

155
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,360
trying to figure that out and we

156
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,160
actually did uh we we invented a what

157
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,319
people call a gene gun uh that actually

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,880
put genes into plants and we were kind

159
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,199
of off to the races then um looking at

160
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,918
different uh traits mostly in row crops

161
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,800
at that time. So soybean, corn, uh those

162
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:37,359
types of things. Um the company was

163
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,280
bought uh I think about 10 years after I

164
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,038
joined it uh by a larger uh agricultural

165
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,719
company. I worked for that company for

166
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,360
20 years doing pretty much the same

167
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,639
thing. So gene engineering um and

168
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,720
editing came along after that. And then

169
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,759
uh recently in 2017

170
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,160
uh the the facility that I work in which

171
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,759
I've I've been here since the early 80s

172
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,240
uh was donated to the University of

173
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
Wisconsin Madison and I came along with

174
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,879
that uh to be the associate director of

175
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:12,079
the facility. Um so we called it the

176
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,759
Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center. Um we

177
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,399
right there and then basically became

178
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:21,120
the largest uh public facility that

179
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:24,318
offered uh both uh institutional people

180
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,720
as well as private companies uh access

181
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,039
to uh put their favorite gene or their

182
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,759
favorite trait into whatever uh crop

183
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,759
that they wanted to to put it into. So

184
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,320
for five years I was the associate

185
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,559
director of the facility. Um and then it

186
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,039
kind of gets into why I why I got into

187
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:45,679
cannabis. Uh so back in you know 2018

188
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:49,399
when the farm bill or 2017 18 when the

189
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:52,399
farm bill came to pass uh Wisconsin

190
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,039
farmers uh a lot of them in 18 were

191
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,480
going hot because of THC levels being

192
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,199
too hot. They had to destroy their

193
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,959
fields. So, there was a big outcry uh to

194
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
see if if there was any anything we

195
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,679
could do either in breeding or

196
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,240
engineering uh that could lower the THC

197
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,159
amounts in in cannabis for growers and

198
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,799
farmers in Wisconsin particularly and

199
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:18,399
and other states that that uh were into

200
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:20,799
CBD. Um so, so the Wisconsin the WCIC

201
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,039
uh since it could do lots of other crops

202
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,879
and was already doing it, we decided to,

203
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,480
you know, get our feet feet wet in in

204
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,399
cannabis and give it a shot. Um so uh

205
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,879
shortly after we started luckily we were

206
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,440
able to do it with sim similar protocols

207
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:39,600
that we used for other uh other species

208
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,920
like soybean. Um so you know from 2018

209
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,159
on uh we've been offering this as a

210
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,639
service to others that uh want to do

211
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:50,240
editing and uh gene engineering in

212
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:52,159
cannabis. I was just I was fascinated by

213
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,639
uh the cannabis plant. I never touched

214
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,120
the cannabis plant until probably 2017,

215
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,919
believe it or not. Um, and the plant

216
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,360
just has so many uh interesting

217
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,519
qualities um and potential uh to hit so

218
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,959
many different areas uh in our economy.

219
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,240
It's it's just it's really neat. So, I

220
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:15,039
actually I actually uh in 2021, I think

221
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,120
I I semi-retired, but I was so

222
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,039
interested in cannabis, I came back

223
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,120
part-time for two days a week, and my

224
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,838
lab's been been doing cannabis research

225
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,679
since then. Excellent. Excellent. So it

226
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,040
seems like that first problem that you

227
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,639
were tasked with solving was sort of um

228
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:35,199
either eliminating or turning off that

229
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:37,278
THCA synthace gene. Yeah, that was the

230
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,040
ask by the growers uh in the state and

231
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,120
that's really what kind of it was the

232
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,199
spring springboard for us to get into

233
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,759
seeing if we could if we could do it uh

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,440
through engineering or editing. Yeah.

235
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,919
Excellent. Excellent. And now now you

236
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,640
mentioned a gan gun.

237
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,439
What what is that? How does that work?

238
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,519
Yeah. So, so back in the 80s, um, there

239
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,160
were, you know, some different competing

240
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,039
people trying to figure out how to put

241
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,719
genes into plants. Um, someone at, I

242
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,399
believe, at Cornell came up with the

243
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,360
idea of, hey, let's let's

244
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:13,600
let's shoot genes through plant tissue

245
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,600
and see if they will if the the genes

246
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,480
will recombine in the plant. So they

247
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,079
actually devised almost like a a

248
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:26,079
crossman air gun, right? Where they they

249
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:28,879
they coded DNA, which are genes, onto

250
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,120
beads and they actually shot them uh

251
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,600
into plants. Um and that was that was

252
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,600
the first official gene gun. The one we

253
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,320
worked at here used um electricity to

254
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,720
propel gold beads that were that were

255
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,079
coated with the genes into plants. So

256
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,200
actually, you know, almost like a

257
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:50,239
shotgun approach uh to put genes into

258
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,079
plants. Yeah. And now at what stage of

259
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,440
growth are the plants when you're kind

260
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,759
of hitting them with these genes? I

261
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,399
imagine it's got to be pretty early on.

262
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,120
Yeah, it it it can it can vary widely

263
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,360
depending on what crop you're trying to

264
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,799
put the genes into. Some plants you

265
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,879
start out with very small protolasts,

266
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,559
which are single cells that you're

267
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,559
putting the gene into. They don't have a

268
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,039
cell wall. it's fairly easy to put the

269
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,599
gene in and then those protolasts like I

270
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:22,919
said in some species you can make grow

271
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,278
into a full-size plant right um other

272
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,159
species are are re what's called

273
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,639
recalcitrant to protolast transformation

274
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:33,039
cannabis is one of those um so we start

275
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,919
out with our group anyway starts out

276
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:39,838
with a small embryo so it's basically

277
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,838
the embryo that's within a a mature seed

278
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,240
you embibe it overnight in water, you

279
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,000
soak it. And if you've ever soaked seeds

280
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,159
in water, you start seeing a little a

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,839
little uh chute coming out of it, right?

282
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,039
That's the root radical, and that's part

283
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,639
of the embryo. So, we take that embryo

284
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,958
and we we can actually either introduce

285
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,959
the DNA with the gene gun into that

286
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,159
embryo and then that embryo will grow

287
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,559
into a plant like like we do with

288
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:08,399
cannabis or we use a different method

289
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,399
other than the gene gun. And this is our

290
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,240
our our favored method. We use a

291
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,120
bacteria that in nature naturally

292
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,399
infects plants and delivers the DNA uh

293
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,399
into the cells called bacterium. So

294
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,879
you've sort of hijacked the mechanism in

295
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,039
that bacteria to deliver this DNA.

296
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,559
Exactly. Right. Yeah. Yeah. We take out

297
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,399
certain genes that the bacteria would

298
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,199
normally insert into the plant and we

299
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,879
put in whatever gene uh we want to put

300
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,240
in whether it's a gene that affects

301
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,799
yield or uh insect resistance or you

302
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,120
know whatever that may be or a a gene

303
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,519
that could knock out THC for example.

304
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,159
Interesting. So now what is the source

305
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,519
of the gene that you're sort of um that

306
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,838
you're injecting? Is it sort of um

307
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,159
synthetic synthetically created or how

308
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,880
does that work?

309
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,519
the sky's is the limit. Um you can take

310
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,639
you can you know DNA is DNA um whether

311
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,000
it's your DNA or a bacteria DNA or plant

312
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:11,039
DNA uh you can take an existing gene uh

313
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,480
from another plant let's say u and and

314
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:17,039
put it into cannabis. um you know people

315
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,039
that would be a a a genetically modified

316
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,599
plant in by definition because you're

317
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,480
taking a gene that is from another plant

318
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,720
that normally wouldn't uh cross or

319
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,560
wouldn't breed with cannabis. Um so

320
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,560
that's considered a genetically modified

321
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:35,198
organism GMO. Um or in our case if we if

322
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:39,119
I again use the example of our our THC

323
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:41,838
free line um we actually just we

324
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,480
manipulate the gene that produces the

325
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:49,040
THC or and the CBD in in our case we

326
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:54,480
manipulate that. So we just turn it off

327
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:57,120
by by taking a single base from the DNA

328
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,480
out of the gene that makes the THC. And

329
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,919
that's and I don't know if we'll get

330
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,360
into that, but that's that's gene

331
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:07,120
editing. Um, and in our case, we use uh

332
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,480
a system called crisper casts, which uh

333
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,360
a lot of people are starting to hear

334
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,519
about, right? And so that crisper

335
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,600
um method different from the one you

336
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,078
described earlier where that uses the uh

337
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,320
the bacteria to sort of put the the gene

338
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:26,399
into the genome. Um it the way that you

339
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,480
put the the DNA into the genome is

340
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,679
exactly the same. So you can you can

341
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,800
either shoot it in with a gun or you can

342
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,278
uh have it delivered through

343
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,679
aggraacterium

344
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:39,439
transformation. But in a GMO case,

345
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,078
you're just taking that gene and

346
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,880
inserting it into the into the cannabis

347
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,198
plant and it'll and then it expresses or

348
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,439
makes the trait. Um with the crisper

349
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,519
method, you're introducing the actual

350
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,079
crisper. So it's an enzyme. It's a it's

351
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,159
an en enzyme that basically cuts DNA

352
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:01,519
like a scissors and you have a targeting

353
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,759
piece of RNA. It's called a guide RNA

354
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,159
that goes in with the crisper enzyme in

355
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,399
your through agroacterium transformation

356
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,719
goes into the plant cell and then that

357
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,759
guide RNA sits down on whatever gene

358
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,519
you're trying to edit. Right? So it sits

359
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,839
down on it and then the crisper enzyme

360
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,720
comes in and cuts it right at a precise

361
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,920
location. So in our case, we were

362
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,839
targeting the the CBD synthes, which

363
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,360
that's the enzyme that actually makes a

364
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,680
little bit of THC in CBD in type three

365
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,839
cannabis, right? So we were targeting

366
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:41,039
that CBD enzyme with that guide RNA. The

367
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,360
crisper came in and cut that CBD gene,

368
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,759
right? And when you cut a gene and it

369
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,959
doesn't come back together exactly the

370
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,879
same way, it shuts it off. So now that

371
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:56,719
enzyme is not active. It can't turn CBG

372
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:59,759
into CBD or THC anymore. So the plant

373
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,440
that we made was basically THC free, CBD

374
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,959
free, but it had a lot of CBG, which is

375
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,838
the precursor uh canabonoid to both THC

376
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,120
and CBD. Interesting. Okay. So same

377
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:15,678
delivery um mechanism. It's just instead

378
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,678
of introducing a new gene, you're

379
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,240
introducing the enzymes and everything

380
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,640
for that comes along with CASP. Exactly.

381
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,400
Crisper. Yeah. Yeah. And there are other

382
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,759
delivery methods that people use, but

383
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,439
that, you know, the one I described with

384
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,960
the gene gun and the aggroacterium,

385
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,038
those are the most most common.

386
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,600
Excellent. Very cool. Yeah. And I think

387
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,000
you sort of started to and and maybe you

388
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,159
did a good job, but I maybe want to um

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,679
uh just re-emphasize sort of the

390
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,919
different terms here and defining them

391
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,919
of like what is genetic engineering,

392
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,480
what is gene editing and sort of um you

393
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,360
know clarify those. Sure. Sure. Yeah.

394
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,759
So, so genetic engineering um is is I

395
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,759
guess is kind of defined as moving a

396
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,319
gene from one species to another. So for

397
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:04,558
instance, if I maybe if I give an

398
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:10,000
example. So back in the mid to late 80s,

399
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:13,279
uh the papaya plant was basically being

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,679
decimated by a virus called ringpot,

401
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,759
right? So the all the Hawaiian

402
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,679
plantations were were being devastated

403
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:23,759
at the time and they couldn't breed in a

404
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,080
a good resistant or bring in a good

405
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:29,119
resistant line. So the University of

406
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:33,439
Hawaii and uh Cornell I believe

407
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:35,918
identified a gene um not from papaya but

408
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,600
a a gene that would be resistant to the

409
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,080
papaya ringpot virus. So they put that

410
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,719
gene and this was actually with a gene

411
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:48,798
gun. um they put that gene into papaya

412
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,440
into a papaya plant um and and found out

413
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:55,038
that yes indeed that plant was resistant

414
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,120
fully resistant to uh the ringpot virus.

415
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,400
So that since that gene didn't come from

416
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:03,439
papaya, that's an example of a GMO or a

417
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,759
a genetically modified organism, right?

418
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,600
So now, you know, I don't know if you

419
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,440
you knew or people most people don't

420
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,678
know that, you know, most of the papaya

421
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,640
plants that we've been eating since uh

422
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,798
the late ' 80s are GMOs. Um but it's

423
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
it's it's you know, that one particular

424
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,960
gene that gives it resistance to that

425
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:23,119
papaya disease. Excellent. Another

426
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,679
example maybe, you know, is is a purple

427
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,918
tomato that came out recently last year.

428
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,679
Uh they came out with a purple tomato.

429
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,640
That was another uh genetically modified

430
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,200
tomato that was made through

431
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,640
aggroacterium transformation, but it

432
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,600
just put basically in genes that uh were

433
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,759
anthocyanin genes. And so they're making

434
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,839
purple tomatoes.

435
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,879
Excellent. And and on the on the flip

436
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:51,199
side, gene editing is is a little

437
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,520
different because now you're basically

438
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,759
just removing a little bit of sequence

439
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,400
or or adding sequence that's already

440
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,079
there into the existing cannabis plant

441
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,400
from its own genome. So you're not

442
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,480
bringing in an external gene. You're

443
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,200
just either, you know, cutting it and

444
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,000
deleting a few bases or bringing in a

445
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,240
gene that's uh that's in cannabis

446
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
already to give it a different different

447
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,558
trait. Okay. Okay, so that's the main

448
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,079
distinction then engineering introducing

449
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:22,038
genes from a different plant. Editing is

450
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,480
um just

451
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:26,640
editing the existing genome in that

452
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,798
plant. Yeah. And I guess a way to look

453
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,240
at it is the way that that um I guess

454
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:35,079
the FDA or USDA look at it is is um if

455
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,359
if the plant can be made by normal

456
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,279
breeding. Um because through normal

457
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,599
breeding, you know, when you take two

458
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,599
plants, two cannabis plants together and

459
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,839
breed them, there's going to be a lot of

460
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,519
shuffling of different genes and

461
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,759
amongst, you know, amongst their

462
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,480
genomes. So if it's if it's something

463
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,119
you can make through normal breeding,

464
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,279
which editing is because you're just um

465
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,038
you know taking out or adding a few

466
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,599
bases of its own genome, then they

467
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,319
consider that editing

468
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:08,079
and Yeah. No, and that's that's a good

469
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,918
point too in terms of um you know

470
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,359
regular breeding. It mixes up all the

471
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,880
genes and everything. So once you that

472
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:17,038
you've edited or engineered a new plant,

473
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,200
how do you go about propagating that

474
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:24,240
plant to ensure that um you know its

475
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,240
progeny inherit those traits? Yeah. You

476
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,798
know, it's really no different than than

477
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,960
traditional breeding. Um you know, you

478
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,440
you insert either the gene through

479
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,400
through genetic engineering or change it

480
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,000
through editing and then you find out,

481
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
you know, what the progyny look like,

482
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,919
what it what its children look like. uh

483
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,759
the next generation, you grow those out

484
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,960
in the greenhouse. Subsequent

485
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,319
generations, you grow out um and you you

486
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,240
look at what they look like. You

487
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,839
phenotype them, you genotype them

488
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,759
through uh sequencing uh and and just

489
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,439
basically, you know, see, have you have

490
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,960
you introduced the trait that you think

491
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,558
you're going to have? Um and then and

492
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,279
just take it out multiple generational

493
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,519
to see if it's stable, see if it does if

494
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,000
it doesn't change over time. um and then

495
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:13,918
eventually uh bring it to market or

496
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,599
launch it. Excellent. Um now you

497
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,200
mentioned before that you know you

498
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,119
started on different crops and then sort

499
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,600
of are applying it to cannabis. Is

500
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:23,678
cannabis any more or less difficult to

501
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,199
work with when you're doing editing or

502
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,159
engineering?

503
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,120
Yeah. Um for sure. Uh cannabis falls

504
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,720
into I mentioned you know the word

505
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:36,959
recalcitrance. Uh cannabis falls into

506
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,360
that that um definition because you know

507
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,840
we work we work in tissue culture either

508
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,719
with protolast or with embryos in

509
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,000
sterile culture right cannabis is a

510
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
plant that if you start out with a

511
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,119
protolast or start out with a leaf um

512
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,000
it's very difficult extremely difficult

513
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,319
to take that leaf and grow it into a

514
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,079
plant. It doesn't respond very well to

515
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,918
different hormones and things like that

516
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:05,839
to actually grow into a full-blown

517
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:08,440
plant. Um so fortunately for us um at at

518
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:11,359
at at this center we focused on that

519
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,038
embryo. We a lot of the a lot of the

520
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,319
plants we work with we focus on that

521
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,400
merist stem or that embryo uh to do the

522
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,960
to do the work with. And fortunately for

523
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,440
us, cannabis um if you take that embryo,

524
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,120
that embryo can grow directly into a

525
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,159
plant um be be uh fertile and h and have

526
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:33,199
progeny and transmit the its its genetic

527
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,039
makeup to to the children. Interesting.

528
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
Lots lots of groups are doing, you know,

529
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,359
tissue culture work. They're struggling

530
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,839
with it. I think um there's been a lot

531
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:46,038
of breakthroughs in the last few years

532
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:48,798
to figure out how to uh make those

533
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:50,079
recalcitin uh plants grow into plants.

534
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,480
So there's a lot of progress there I

535
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,639
think in it won't be too long uh in

536
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,120
cannabis uh people able to do that with

537
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,120
cannabis. Excellent. But is there

538
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,158
anything about the genome that makes it

539
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,158
any more or

540
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:07,280
less difficult or is it all sort of

541
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,120
ATC's and G's? Yeah, not really. Um, you

542
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,639
know, it's got a fairly small genome.

543
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:15,918
It's a diploid. Um, I don't think people

544
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,278
know to this date, uh, and maybe I'm

545
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,080
wrong here, but, uh, why certain plants,

546
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,640
uh, just don't respond well to growing

547
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:28,558
up, you know, from a single cell start

548
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,799
growing up into a into a full plant. Um

549
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,079
it's it's

550
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:34,319
definitely if you use that tissue

551
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:38,079
culture method when you're trying to

552
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,839
insert genes or to edit plants um

553
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,439
sometimes that tissue culture method

554
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:46,158
only works on certain genotypes. So a

555
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,240
certain cannabis genotype um may may

556
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,799
respond better in tissue culture than

557
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,240
another genotype. Yeah. For for our

558
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:56,720
embryo system we can basically do any

559
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,079
genotype. It just because you're not

560
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,319
starting out with that single cell,

561
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,359
you're starting with embryo. Uh we can

562
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,119
probably do I would say most genotypes.

563
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,879
Yeah. And now is that something that's

564
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,359
maybe more unique to cannabis and hemp

565
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,278
is just sort of the d variety of the

566
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,959
different cultivars that there are out

567
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,278
there.

568
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,360
Um you know, there certainly are a ton

569
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,839
of varieties out there. Cannabis is one

570
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:23,519
of these

571
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:26,240
um it's not it's not an an inbred uh

572
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,158
plant there. there there's so much uh

573
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,960
mix up of the genome and and most of the

574
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,799
cannabis varieties you have now are very

575
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,720
hetererozygous in nature. um they're not

576
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:38,558
like, you know, a corn or soybean where

577
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,159
you have inbredads, you cross these two

578
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,720
inbredads and you get this beautiful

579
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,320
hybrid plant, right? Um people are

580
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,880
really working hard in the cannabis

581
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,158
industry to get to those h that that

582
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,320
hybrid vigor uh by make trying to make

583
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,000
these inbredads, but it it'll come

584
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,439
sooner or later. But uh it you

585
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,440
know the thing about cannabis is

586
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,840
nobody's really been working on it you

587
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,080
know other than other than the folks um

588
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,158
you know that smoke it and and whatever

589
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,720
for 80 years there's been just no

590
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,480
research and thankfully in the last you

591
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,880
know five or 10 years that's really

592
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,400
starting to pick up um and I think a lot

593
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,679
of things will change you know for the

594
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,679
better. Excellent. Um, so I guess

595
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,000
briefly, can you explain some of the

596
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,759
benefits of genetic engineering and

597
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,519
editing over traditional breeding

598
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,038
techniques and and possibly some

599
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:32,158
drawbacks?

600
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:36,558
Um, benefits I think uh I I think it can

601
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,880
be a faster way to uh get to your end

602
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:42,000
point. So you know breeding takes many

603
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,320
many many years. um back in the 50s,

604
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,679
60s, 70s, many years, you know, pere

605
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,960
breeders, traditional breeders would go

606
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,798
out in the field and say, "Yep, I like

607
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,960
that plant. I like plant. Let's cross

608
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,200
them. Let's see what we get." Then

609
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,278
molecular breeding came into play where

610
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,200
everybody knew genome sequences and they

611
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,880
could pick out certain genes to put

612
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,640
together that they would, you know,

613
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,960
postulate would work really well. That

614
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,520
that speeded breeding up quite a bit.

615
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,079
Genetic engineering and editing, you're

616
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,759
targeting, you know, very specific genes

617
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,798
that you want to change. you're not

618
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:16,240
fiddling with with with much else. So

619
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:19,119
getting to that um getting to that that

620
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,400
final point is I think much quicker can

621
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,239
be much quicker than traditional

622
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:27,440
breeding because you're not bringing two

623
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,599
um uh dissimilar plants together. You

624
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,360
know, one may bring a lot of baggage,

625
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,038
right, with it and then you've got to go

626
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,798
through multiple generation to get rid

627
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,158
of that baggage. through genetic

628
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,319
engineering, you're just targeting that

629
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,120
that single gene or that that single

630
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,359
thing to change um and then see how it

631
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,519
how it changes. So, I think speed is

632
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,519
probably one of the big things. Um and

633
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,158
and you know, now that we know the

634
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,759
genome sequence um targeting those

635
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,960
particular genes is becoming much

636
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:57,839
easier. Are there any ever any like

637
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,240
unintended consequences of of kind of

638
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,278
changing or turning off a gene that kind

639
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,919
of affects something you weren't

640
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:07,278
expecting? Yeah. So far, I haven't had

641
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,200
any plants walk away on me. Um that's

642
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,759
that's what everybody, you know, back

643
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,159
back in the day was the Franken food,

644
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,879
you know, stuff. Um sure, there's

645
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:21,039
there's always there's always

646
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,360
um things that you don't expect um

647
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,519
because it's research. Um you may come

648
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,599
up with the best plan in the world and

649
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,200
you know there are thousands and

650
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,959
thousands of genes that interact with

651
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,798
each other. So by shutting down one

652
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,798
gene, you know, maybe you've got

653
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,798
different regulation going on and it's

654
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,278
not exactly what you would expect, but

655
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,599
you learn from that, you go forward. Um,

656
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,839
and then, you know, you try again. So

657
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:47,199
there have been lots of times where I

658
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,879
don't know if I'd I'd say, but um things

659
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,120
just don't work. You know, you think you

660
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,559
you you have a solution. Yeah. It just

661
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,239
doesn't work. Not sure why. You you you

662
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,119
go back to the drawing board and try to

663
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,319
figure it out. Yeah. No, but to your

664
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,479
point, I mean, it it must be much

665
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,038
quicker to iterate on some of those

666
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,399
those errors or misses rather than sort

667
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,879
of going through generations and

668
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:13,359
generations of breeding to finally

669
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,840
figure out this didn't work, you know.

670
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:19,678
Exactly. Yeah. Excellent.

671
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:22,079
Um, so step, so looking sort of big

672
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,919
picture here, um, how do you think gene

673
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,398
editing will shape the future of the

674
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,399
cannabis industry?

675
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,919
Um, I I think I think and I'm going to

676
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,278
probably use these both handinand

677
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,399
whether it's gene editing or whether

678
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,720
it's genetically modifying something.

679
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,918
Um, again, I think we can get to end end

680
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,558
points quicker. Um, I think we can start

681
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,799
thinking out of the box as far as what

682
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,879
we might be able to do with the cannabis

683
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,319
plant. Like I said, you know, for 80

684
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,399
years we haven't done any research

685
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,720
really or not not much research. I

686
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,319
shouldn't say any

687
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,278
because breeding breeding cannabis for

688
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,439
THC was remarkable, right? We've got

689
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,200
plants that are 30 plus THC plants and

690
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,000
that's all through through breeding and

691
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,640
and trial and error and stuff. Um, but

692
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,079
thinking about what the plant may not

693
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,120
may not do on its own very well. um

694
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,158
thinking about some of the rare

695
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:20,239
canabonoids that a lot of the you know I

696
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,640
saw last year at Can Med people were

697
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,159
interested in

698
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,440
CBG CBC

699
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,200
some of the THCV or CBDVs you know

700
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,000
things that the plant doesn't make very

701
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,840
much of we might be able to breed that

702
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,599
might be able to you know through many

703
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,079
years and many iterations of breeding

704
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,199
get to that point but I think with all

705
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,119
the information we have um with the pang

706
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,759
genome out there now we can really

707
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:49,079
narrow narrow down on how to make a

708
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,759
plant that's got, you know, uh 15 to 20%

709
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:54,798
CBC, which you know, we don't have

710
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,480
something like that now. I think uh uh

711
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,240
pharmaceutical companies would be really

712
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,200
interested to see, you know, what that

713
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,759
could do. Um make a plant that's disease

714
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,038
resistance, has disease resistance. PM

715
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,640
is is is out there, hopen vyroid is out

716
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:12,960
there. you know, are there are there

717
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,720
ways we can quickly try to uh change the

718
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,798
plant so that it's so it's doing

719
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,600
something it wouldn't normally do uh on

720
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,839
its own? Um and then not to speak of all

721
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,398
the other all the other things I think

722
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,319
um that are outside the medical world,

723
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:29,439
right? Uh

724
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,678
the industrial hemp I think is huge

725
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,919
steam and I it's it's all a matter of

726
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,919
time before we're growing hemp just like

727
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,960
we're growing uh corn and soybeans, I

728
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,640
think.

729
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,240
Excellent. Yeah. And so you mentioned

730
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,159
the service that you offer there at the

731
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,679
University of Wisconsin where you we'll

732
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,360
actually do sort of gene editing um for

733
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,480
companies or researchers or things like

734
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,398
that. So I mean I if you can divulge

735
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,599
what sort of traits are they interested

736
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,239
in in uh creating?

737
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,759
Yeah. Um so so we do we do work for

738
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,440
other people but we also have some

739
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,960
internal work going on as well and

740
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,038
that's what I'll I'll be presenting at

741
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,440
at CANMED this year. Um, but I hear a

742
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:12,000
lot of people uh like what I just said

743
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,159
are interested in a lot of the rares um

744
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,480
or something that you know the the plant

745
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,399
just doesn't produce very much of. Um

746
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,319
I've heard can flavven talked about

747
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,798
quite a bit. You know can flavven A and

748
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:25,918
B plant makes just a just a little bit

749
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,319
of it but they've been implicated at a

750
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,679
lot of different you know potentially

751
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,839
cancer cancer research um all kinds of

752
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,240
stuff. Um, and a lot of the rarers as

753
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:41,359
well, you know, inflammation. I hear a

754
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:44,519
lot of that for CBC, CBG. Um, and then,

755
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:48,079
uh, other interests might be, uh,

756
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,960
nutrition. Uh, you know, seeds, hemp

757
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,639
seeds, can can we, uh, make them even

758
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,720
more nutritious than they are? Can we

759
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,960
add certain amino acids that may not be

760
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,278
there for chickens, for instance?

761
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,440
Um and then you know industrial hemp

762
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,359
again

763
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:08,798
uh can can we can we make uh you know

764
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:10,240
the hemp plant uh sequester heavy metals

765
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,918
more than it does because we know it

766
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,519
does somewhat. Can we make it even

767
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:19,038
better? Um capturing carbon. Hemp hemp

768
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,319
is a wonderful you know it's a it's a

769
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:25,359
wonderful sustainable plant and it's got

770
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,599
a huge root mass. Um, and I think it's

771
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,158
be a great target for capturing carbon.

772
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,719
Wow. Yeah. A lot of lot of potential.

773
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,399
Yeah. Excellent. All right, Mike. Well,

774
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,319
winding down here. Before I let you go,

775
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:40,479
I want to give you the chance to share

776
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:42,480
any links or um resources that you think

777
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,399
that anyone listening or watching this

778
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,399
might be interested in reading more

779
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,918
about. Um, I'd be happy to put the links

780
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,798
in the show description so that they can

781
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,038
learn more. Uh, so please plug away.

782
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,278
Okay. Well, for sure I'll I'll plug the

783
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,960
Wisconsin Crop Innovation Center. So,

784
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,200
like I said, I've been here a long time.

785
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,640
We've got a service that we provide. Not

786
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,200
a lot of people know about it, and it's

787
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,759
probably because I I'm not a I'm not a

788
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:10,159
good marketer. I'm a scientist. Uh but,

789
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:13,838
uh you know, we provide this service. Uh

790
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,200
and I think we're one of the very few uh

791
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:20,000
that are able to actually edit um and

792
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,319
transform or or engineer hemp. There are

793
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,599
a couple others that are just now saying

794
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,440
they can do it. We've been doing it

795
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,200
since 18. We're very good at it. Um, so

796
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,440
and we do offer it as a service. So,

797
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,759
anybody can come to us and say, "Hey, I

798
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,519
I want to make a a powdery milde

799
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,000
resistant line and here's how I want to

800
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,838
do it." We'll take their gene. We'll

801
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,320
actually we have a a group here that

802
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,159
does molecular biology. we can make the

803
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,159
plasmid that we would put into the hemp

804
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,398
plant and then we would deliver you

805
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,039
plants um out the back end that you can

806
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:54,319
do research on or or whatever you want.

807
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,918
So I can give you that link um um to to

808
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,599
post on there and people can reach out

809
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:01,679
to me directly. Um excellent. And

810
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,599
definitely if you're interested in any

811
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,838
of these topics, we invite everyone to

812
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,280
come to to Canmed this year. Not only

813
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,440
will you hear Mike give his oral

814
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,200
presentation, but like I mentioned, we

815
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,760
have the genomics workshop, which is

816
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,358
going to be a a really great session. I

817
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,640
think we have a lot of heavy hitters and

818
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:20,319
a lot of the leading minds in um in

819
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,400
cannabis genomics. So, we're really

820
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,039
excited to have that and excited to have

821
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,880
you part of it, Mike. Great. Super.

822
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,880
Thank you very much. All right. Uh

823
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,358
thanks again and I look forward to

824
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,570
seeing you down in Puerto Rico. Okay.

825
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:46,918
We'll see you then.

826
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:46,919
