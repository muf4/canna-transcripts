this episode we welcome back TJ Martin

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,159
TJ is the VP of R&amp;D at abstracts a

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,239
company that specializes in the research

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,118
development and production of

40
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,438
botanically derived and cannabis

41
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:56,039
inspired

42
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,000
Turpin TJ and his team recently

43
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,519
published a paper that identified

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,759
several non-terpenoid compounds s that

45
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,239
are responsible for the unique Aromas

46
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,318
associated with exotic varieties of

47
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:11,280
cannabis including the berry tropical

48
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,479
candy and fruity notes found in zittles

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,800
and gelato as well as the rich intense

50
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,598
chemical scents found in varieties like

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,040
GMO This research opens up a new world

52
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,719
of aromatic compounds and challenges the

53
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,959
idea of classifying cultivars based on

54
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:30,239
tpin

55
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,400
alone during our conversation we discuss

56
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,800
how cannabis Aroma affects consumer and

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,760
patient experience the variety of Aromas

58
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,959
the cannabis plant can produce and how

59
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,280
it compares to other plants we Define

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,840
exotic cannabis varieties and compare

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,640
them to more prototypical

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,239
cultivars we discuss why turpins alone

63
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,039
don't tell the entire Aroma story in

64
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,840
exotic cannabis

65
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,878
varieties how to communicate information

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,120
about non-terpenoid compounds to

67
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:01,719
Consumers and patients in a meaningful

68
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,319
way and

69
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,639
more before I get to my conversation

Martin

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,438
good afternoon TJ thanks for joining us

89
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,560
on the podcast thanks for having me Ben

90
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:11,239
I appreciate it all right I am excited

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,120
to talk with you today about cannabis

92
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,439
Aroma some people love it some people

93
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,798
hate it but it's an important part of

94
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,680
the Cannabis experience and a key

95
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,918
differentiator between different cultiv

96
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,079
ours so you joined us on the podcast

97
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,079
last last year Link in the show

98
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,319
description and you also presented at

99
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:34,918
CED 23 link in the show description

100
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:39,120
about the compounds responsible for the

101
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:41,758
sometimes divisive skunky gassy Aroma of

102
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,399
certain cultivars and now your team is

103
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,960
back with another study looking into the

104
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,198
sweet and savory smells of some

105
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,000
cultivars but before we get into that I

106
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,840
want to give you the chance to explain

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,720
to the audience why Aromas are so

108
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,359
important to cannabis and why they're

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,320
important to you and your team at

110
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,680
abstracts yes so cannabis Aromas really

111
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,399
I mean they're really responsible for

112
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,959
driving that consumer experience so when

113
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:13,319
consumers are purchasing whether that be

114
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:15,680
concentrates vape pens flow pre-rolls um

115
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,839
they're may be buying these based on how

116
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,038
they like how it smells and tastes right

117
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,879
and to understand more about why it

118
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:23,759
smells the way it does and tastes the

119
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,680
way it does we want to understand more

120
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,479
about the chemistry behind these Aromas

121
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,280
and understanding this research is

122
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,240
really important to us as a company

123
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,839
because we have an extraction facility

124
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,120
um obviously we create flavor and

125
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,799
turpine blends for various customers but

126
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,840
also just really were curious to see

127
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,680
like why does I mean we understand why

128
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:49,638
OG smell skunky and gassy but why now do

129
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,079
GMOs smell garlicky and savory why do

130
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,160
zittles and runs and all the other

131
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:58,079
Exotics tangies smell fruity tropical

132
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,000
gassy oranges like where are all these

133
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,478
smells and Ras coming from and can we

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,240
start correlating the chemistry to the

135
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,199
human sensory aspect because and as a

136
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,918
company when we start we working on this

137
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,720
for about two three years now um before

138
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:15,318
he published it but really was around

139
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,240
like I think November 2022 we started

140
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,639
seeing regulatories um agencies come out

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,960
with new regulations stating that

142
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,918
cannabis was not fruity or sweet or and

143
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,839
Savory right we've seen this in

144
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,560
California and this isn't this isn't

145
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,198
anything malicious right this is just

146
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,639
because there was no data and

147
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,598
information showing that out in the

148
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,360
marketplace testing Labs couldn't really

149
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:40,199
test for it and there's no Publications

150
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,240
and so we knew we had all this data in

151
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,680
housee we were working towards this

152
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,360
publication like hey we really need to

153
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,840
tell the story right and show people

154
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,319
that hey there is more to the plant than

155
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,478
we may understand at this time that we

156
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,879
know why it smells and tastes grapy

157
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:57,360
right why does GDP have that grape note

158
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,680
why does Blackberry Kush have those dark

159
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,400
berry notes we understand the

160
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,560
chemistries behind

161
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,439
and this is Empower um important

162
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,160
powerful information not only for

163
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:10,879
Regulators people doing cultivation

164
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,800
genetic like breed genetic breeding um

165
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,319
extraction the whole Gambit of the

166
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
industry could benefit from this

167
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,800
information because then you can utilize

168
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,120
this to better improve products and

169
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,120
consumer experiences and when you look

170
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,439
at Publications like Addie Ray and Ethan

171
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,478
Russo's publication they're looking at

172
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,879
they show that the consumer experience

173
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,399
it how much how good that experience is

174
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,879
for the consumer how positive it is was

175
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,239
correlated to how positive they perceive

176
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,080
the aroma to be right so understanding

177
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,800
more of this is going to help give

178
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,560
better experiences to not only existing

179
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,759
consumers but new entry consumers coming

180
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,720
into the industry who may be interested

181
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,800
to try

182
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,680
cannabis excellent yeah I'm glad you

183
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,240
brought up aded Ray and her um her study

184
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,720
there she was a guest on the podcast

185
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll put a link to that one too people

186
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,639
can really go down the rabbit hole um

187
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,918
but yeah that was really interesting

188
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:07,680
where yeah she would have folks in the

189
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:10,959
study smell different types of Canabis

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,918
and rate how how how good they thought

191
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,439
they smelled and then actually consume

192
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,799
it and kind of rate their experience and

193
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,120
saw a correlation where if you like the

194
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,879
way it smelled you tended to like the

195
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,000
experience which was pretty pretty

196
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,120
powerful 100% right I mean it it just

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,560
going to show that understanding more

198
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,240
about why it smells and tastes the way

199
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,519
it does is super important for whole

200
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,000
wide ranging um different product types

201
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,519
and our understanding of this industry

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,278
and trying to again Empower consumers to

203
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,839
make more educated decisions and get

204
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,720
better experience of the products right

205
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,360
I mean a lot of people who've been

206
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,278
either in the industry or have consumed

207
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,919
cannabis a lot of people have bad

208
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:53,000
experiences and bad stories right maybe

209
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,319
if we have more education and more

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,519
understanding of what's going on we can

211
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,560
avoid those circumstances and those

212
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,399
those bad experiences yeah for sure no

213
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,919
so I was interested you mentioned

214
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,559
regulators and sort of them talking

215
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,559
about how cannabis isn't fruity or uh or

216
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,559
savory or anything so was there

217
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:15,518
something on the table or a push to sort

218
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:17,559
of regulate cannabis products that are

219
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,320
maybe too fruity like I know for example

220
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:23,518
here in Massachusetts with tobacco um

221
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,480
you can't you can't buy flavored tobacco

222
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,519
so was there a similar idea going on in

223
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,360
cannabis with cannabis yeah in

224
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,480
California there was um regulations in

225
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,720
the regulated California Cannabis Market

226
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,759
that are saying that if cannabis doesn't

227
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,160
have you can't add flavors to cannabis

228
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:42,078
that are not natively present right okay

229
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:45,919
things like blueberry blackberry so dark

230
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:47,879
berries grapes red berries strawberries

231
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,399
a whole Gambit of various fruits and

232
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,720
sweet flavors that and again at the time

233
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,278
it wasn't done with any Mal intent but

234
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,639
rather the scientific knowledge just

235
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,320
wasn't out there in the marketplace

236
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,600
right and so when you're looking at

237
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,519
making decisions on not flavoring

238
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,360
product because you or whatever reason

239
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,720
may be um you're looking at from what

240
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,120
well they're looking to see hey let's

241
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,920
keep it smell and taste the way it does

242
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,759
and if you're coming at the context of

243
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,120
what a testing lab tests for or just the

244
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,600
individual turbines and gassy skunk

245
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,839
you're like the classical prototypical

246
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,120
cannabis you're missing this whole realm

247
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,640
of new exotic genetics that have been

248
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,240
created over the past few decades right

249
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,240
there's been a lot of genetic breeding

250
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,278
work being done that have pushed the

251
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,399
boundaries on cannabis cultivars to make

252
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:38,200
them way more sweet and fruity or way

253
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,399
more Savory and garlicky and push those

254
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,278
those edges to see what else the the

255
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,519
plant is capable of producing yeah so it

256
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,120
was really important to kind of

257
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,679
establish at least a baseline for what

258
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,639
the what the plant's able to to produce

259
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:55,958
so that we sort of we sort of know right

260
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,600
100% right I mean no way like Again The

261
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,319
Regulators can look at this type of work

262
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,839
and see and understand hey there is more

263
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,079
more to this than just the basic tpping

264
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,600
panel but also as an extractor if you're

265
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,278
trying to make a better extract and

266
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,159
you're only looking at turpins those are

267
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,799
hydrocarbon based there's a whole lot of

268
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:14,278
other more polar species like the Esters

269
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,639
we discovered here bottle sulfur

270
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,958
compounds these if you understand more

271
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,680
of the chemistry you can start to change

272
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,838
and adapt your extraction processes your

273
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,319
growing and curing processes if needed

274
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,480
or even your packaging scenarios right

275
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,120
if you understand more about the

276
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,000
volatiles and what's there and you want

277
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,159
to preserve something for a longer shelf

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,159
life if you're only un only measuring

279
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:40,000
things like lemine and Meine or beta

280
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:41,799
care offine you're not capturing these

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,919
more volatile notes that consumers may

282
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,759
be looking for right as we saw in ad Ray

283
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,519
study there wasn't a correlation between

284
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,200
the top three turpins and their

285
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,720
consumer's preference of the experience

286
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,360
but rather just the preference of the

287
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,720
overall Aroma of the

288
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,959
product yeah so that's important so I

289
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,480
think most cannabis consumers by now are

290
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:05,319
familiar with tpin and sort of the role

291
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,560
that they play in uh the experience the

292
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,680
smells and you know even the actual

293
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,559
experience of consuming but as you point

294
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,719
out in the paper that tpin are only

295
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:17,799
telling a a small portion of the overall

296
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,440
story and that sort of some of these

297
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:23,319
attempts to classify cultivars by their

298
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,480
top tpin um weren't really working so

299
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,440
speak a little bit to that yeah so I

300
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,879
mean if you look within the study we we

301
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,120
were trying to measure a broad variety

302
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,759
of exotic cannabis cultivars everything

303
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,919
from as sweet and fruity as possible get

304
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,600
something that is dark ber some that has

305
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,039
tropical notes something that has weird

306
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,920
Citrus notes like Tangi but also

307
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:48,039
prototypical and you can look at some of

308
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:50,360
the Exotics and some maybe tropical and

309
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:52,078
others may be dark berry and they have a

310
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,240
lot of either lemon or one of these

311
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,120
major three turpins but they don't smell

312
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,600
the same and when you go to the Savory

313
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,480
front like GMO and other Savory Exotics

314
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,759
they also have similar top turpins but

315
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,480
their overall Aromas aren't anything

316
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:09,439
close now that doesn't mean that the the

317
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,879
Turpin don't impart any flavoring AR at

318
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,600
all in it wasn't part of the research

319
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,120
publication itself but we did some

320
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,320
studies in our lab just to see well what

321
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,879
would happen if we stripped all the

322
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,879
turpins out and did just everything else

323
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,720
right what's this going to smell and

324
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,120
taste like pretty weird um straight up

325
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,160
it didn't didn't smell and taste like

326
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,399
cannabis was unbalanced it had a very

327
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,600
weird non-descript experience that was

328
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,519
just very just unpleasant it's not until

329
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,920
you have everything there that it has

330
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,278
all the balance of what the plant

331
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,519
intended right you have all the

332
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,120
everything basically in Sy and working

333
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,198
just harmoniously together to give it

334
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,959
this full experience because you strip

335
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:52,838
out that core base of what makes

336
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,439
cannabis unique and even though it's

337
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,639
like even though lemoning may not

338
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,519
correlate to Exotic specific nature it

339
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,519
doesn't mean it has no impact back to

340
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,959
the the flavor and Aroma of cannabis

341
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,839
that we all know and appreciate um and

342
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:08,359
so having it all there is super

343
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,839
important but it's not the defining

344
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,839
features of what makes it exotic it's a

345
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,920
it's required to give it that full

346
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,880
experience but it doesn't help Define

347
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:19,198
that exotic note a lot of that coming

348
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,799
from those Esters these other new

349
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,479
compounds we discovered in this specific

350
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:27,559
study right so it's almost like music

351
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,079
where you know maybe your chapines are

352
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:34,919
your drum kit and your guitar and your

353
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:37,078
bass guitar but it's really sort of the

354
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,319
you know synthesizers or the other sort

355
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,399
of instruments that you're layering in

356
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,399
on top of that that makes it sort of a

357
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,958
unique musical composition 100% it's

358
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,600
it's exactly how we started to explain

359
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,958
it to a lot of the customers and our

360
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,519
sales team we've been working with when

361
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,278
we try and bring this complex chemistry

362
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,360
and bring it to layers down the way to

363
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,240
explain it is just like that right if

364
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,959
you have a symphony and you strip out

365
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,879
your string quartets your strings or

366
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:08,958
your brass you're still GNA have music

367
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:11,559
but is it the same no right it maybe not

368
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:14,599
like tping they are absolutely needed

369
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:17,719
but they're not that the most only thing

370
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,320
representive of Alla right that would be

371
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,560
that's where again the study came in to

372
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,040
show that hey tpin yes they have

373
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,359
importance and value but there's more we

374
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,799
haven't been considering as an industry

375
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,680
that play a significant role that we

376
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,120
should start looking at

377
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,039
yeah and you mentioned it earlier that

378
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,120
extraction techniques might be favoring

379
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,399
certain compounds versus other ones so

380
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,240
how do you sort of dial that in to make

381
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,360
sure that you're still capturing some of

382
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,759
these minor compounds that uh that are

383
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,440
contributing so I mean it's tough right

384
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,000
it's you have to have analytics with

385
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,399
your extraction but if you understand

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
all the compounds that are there if you

387
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,360
want to dial in your extraction you can

388
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,078
test out different parameters and now

389
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,360
look and see is they we're working on

390
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,439
say GDP very very purple grape heavy

391
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,278
type of smell and Aroma methyl anther

392
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,000
annihilate like if we if in one extract

393
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:11,360
you see methyl anthr annihilate lower

394
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,519
than it should be and you want to

395
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,519
increase it well you can change some

396
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,560
parameters and monitor that specific

397
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,919
compound to see hey are we capturing

398
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,239
this more appropriately and can we

399
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,318
change our parameters to address this um

400
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,198
and it's just Again by having all this

401
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,559
information you can start to ask these

402
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:33,359
questions on how do we improve processes

403
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,318
to start better capturing or emphasizing

404
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,759
these

405
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:39,799
notes excellent so so we talked about

406
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,919
the tpin and now that there is these

407
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:46,519
extra minor non was it non-t turpenoid

408
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,240
volatile compounds so speak a little bit

409
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,440
about that like are there C are there

410
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,240
different classes there are these are

411
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,480
these compounds completely unique um

412
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,318
that haven't been found elsewhere that

413
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,759
are they unique to cannabis or are you

414
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:05,279
actually finding them in other other

415
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,880
plants so the majority of these I mean

416
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,759
these are all like botanically there's

417
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,280
are all found in other Botanical so like

418
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,359
there's a lot of obviously lot of plants

419
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,599
in the world right and things like like

420
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:20,599
blueberries strawberries um other things

421
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,000
like basil these all produce tpin for

422
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,798
sure they'll have some in there right

423
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,440
but also other other flavorants like

424
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,839
alahh Esters ketones that impart

425
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,960
different notes that make each plant

426
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:36,000
unique and cannabis isn't the first

427
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,919
plant to produce these um at least not

428
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,679
that we've seen but it does have a broad

429
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,679
diversity of Aromas right I've never

430
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,080
picked up two Basils and one smells like

431
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:49,080
basil and one smells like a fruit it's

432
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:52,199
basil is basil whereas cannabis has this

433
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,319
weird broad range of different Aromas

434
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,840
that a lot of plants least at least from

435
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,359
what we've measured I'm not claiming to

436
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,759
be the world's expert in all plants but

437
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:02,798
it does have had this huge broad

438
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,279
diversity in it and so the study it's we

439
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,038
did find a lot of these different Esters

440
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,759
again they're known in nature um the

441
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:10,240
only ones that we didn't see a lot in

442
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,038
other recorded nature a lot of what are

443
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,558
the seates these are what would be if

444
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,879
you're thinking in the context of

445
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,119
cannabis like what makes zidd different

446
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,840
from a lot of other fruity cultivars so

447
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,158
it has that sweet weird uniquely zidd

448
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,959
candy note to it that in particular I

449
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,679
mean it has a lot of those senates which

450
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:33,079
are a type of Esther flavorant

451
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:36,640
okay and now your typical Cannabis

452
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:38,759
Testing Lab do they have the equipment

453
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,440
available to be testing for these sort

454
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,279
of

455
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,840
things the the most Cannabis Testing

456
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:45,720
Labs all have they for sure have a GC

457
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,480
right that's why they're doing a lot of

458
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,960
their solvent testing um they may be

459
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,440
doing some pesticide testing on there

460
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,759
for the volatile pesticides and most of

461
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,240
them tend to have a gcms single or

462
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,839
triple quad So in theory they could test

463
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,159
for some of these compounds do they have

464
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:03,359
the methods built out for it probably

465
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:06,600
not just because there hasn't been a

466
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,719
real um need or or even real demand I

467
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,719
should say from the industry to test for

468
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,279
these things was until we came with this

469
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,480
publication that even we start getting

470
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:16,918
asked now more we start hearing more

471
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,079
conversations about Esters right at

472
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,080
first it was the penol BC's like what

473
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,240
makes cannabis smell skunky and gassy

474
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:25,960
now it's right hey we know more now what

475
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,279
else can we test for and understand

476
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,679
right and now are there standards

477
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,519
available for these yeah you can procure

478
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,840
standards available for these because a

479
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,798
lot of these ingredients like for

480
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:38,240
example meth anate ethylate ethy isob

481
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:39,720
valorate these are these are Esther

482
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,359
compounds that are used for a lot of

483
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,079
grapes and dark berry com flavors these

484
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,038
are used in the traditional flavor

485
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,480
industry we have a knowledge of how to

486
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:49,038
use them and we have them on site

487
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,319
because we have a traditional flavor

488
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,919
house obviously work a lot with cannabis

489
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:54,240
companies to we work with a lot on

490
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,360
creating different flavors different

491
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,440
products for but we have all these in

492
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:00,359
house and a lot of other companies do as

493
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,360
well and there do exist standards for a

494
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,038
lot of them some of them not so much

495
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:07,158
like the cits that are way more nichy to

496
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,919
cannabis and are more newly discovered

497
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,400
maybe not so much but the others I mean

498
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,440
there are companies who do produce them

499
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
but just because you have a standard

500
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,279
doesn't mean you have the method to

501
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,120
fully separate out the complexity of

502
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,359
this cannabis right cannabis produces

503
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,959
sometimes hundreds of volatiles

504
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,158
depending on which ctiv are your

505
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,240
measuring so the paper mentions

506
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,799
specifically exotic variety of cannabis

507
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,558
how do you define

508
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,558
exotic tough right super broad term when

509
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:39,798
we first started this we came

510
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:42,678
into coming into the study like I said

511
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:45,720
like two three years ago we looked at

512
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:48,480
from the context of hey we just we've

513
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,440
written a case study on Jack Herer like

514
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:55,200
your typical hazes um we've wrote wrot

515
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,600
our paper on um penal VC compounds for

516
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,798
the skunky gasy notes in cannabis but we

517
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,759
we weren't answering the questions on

518
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,798
why a lot of cannabis smells sweet

519
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,079
fruity tropical citrusy right and not

520
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:12,000
citrusy like a jack but citrusy in the

521
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:13,879
context of like a weird Tangi and so

522
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,640
want to see like I mean when we hear a

523
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,278
lot of about exotic cannabis at least in

524
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,679
the California Market a lot of it tends

525
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:22,640
to be very fruity and sweet and so

526
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,000
that's we started measuring we were

527
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,278
pulling in also prototypical samples

528
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,798
because you need a control and we also

529
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:33,319
pulled got procured samp of GMO

530
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,720
because I mean GMO is a really weird one

531
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,918
for sure and also if nothing else it is

532
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,240
super gassi and it's almost basically

533
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,799
the polar opposite of a fruity exotic

534
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,960
and so came in the context well like

535
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:47,480
let's measure these and see if we can

536
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,000
start pulling correlations on the

537
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,519
chemistry of what's Happening Here for

538
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,839
these various nodes right A lot of these

539
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,798
studies how we do these is we have our

540
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:58,199
in-house sensory panel uh various

541
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:00,038
cannabis consumers who who have been

542
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,558
trained and have been consuming cannabis

543
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:05,599
for years now and we'll have them go

544
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,119
through on this study we gave them some

545
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,759
we gave them guidance on questions we

546
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,079
gave them a lot of free form on what

547
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,440
they could use we didn't restrict them

548
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,278
to any specific

549
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,640
terms um and with with within reason

550
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:20,319
right I mean some people had some pretty

551
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,559
out there terms you want to bring it in

552
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,720
bring it in at least in the right realm

553
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,879
but um and we correlate that to the GC

554
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,679
um data to see are there Trends we're

555
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,360
noticing and remember when we're going

556
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,880
through the panel um Ian who's the lead

557
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:36,079
author on this with me he when he was

558
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,000
running one of the panels with one of

559
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:41,599
our other panelist Steve um shout out to

560
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,319
Steve did a great job on this he we we

561
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,719
was we going through GMO and like hey as

562
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,399
pan like what do you guys think of GMO

563
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,278
would you consider that exotic would you

564
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,120
consider like a fruity exotic or a

565
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:55,119
prototypical and they're like it's kind

566
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,519
of neither right it was it's and if you

567
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,158
think more about GMO it's not true OG it

568
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:03,440
is a bit different from like a typical

569
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,600
OG kush or Skywalker OG everybody was

570
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,038
like you know it is more Savory is

571
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,399
there maybe we need better terms to

572
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,879
describe this and so that's when we

573
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,559
started looking into an understanding

574
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,000
well we know GMO was referenced as

575
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,200
garlic mushroom onion Cookies cannabis

576
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,519
right as a

577
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,278
cultivar um maybe there's some chemical

578
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,599
explanation for it and we started

579
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:26,359
looking more into the data at least

580
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:29,038
that's how we discovered scat Hol and

581
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:31,038
indle in cannabis which are used that's

582
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,240
what's really driving those weird unique

583
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:38,000
Aromas of GMO scat is most commonly

584
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,480
associated with feces right gives fees

585
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,519
that poop smell to it and it just

586
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,319
happens to also be in GMO and a lot of

587
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:48,519
these weird Savory Exotics now it's at a

588
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,240
level such that it doesn't smell exact

589
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,639
like poop it has its own

590
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,440
weird non EXO nonf fruity exotic but

591
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,960
more Savory note to

592
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:03,480
it so so I understand when you say

593
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,600
exotic it's either sweet Savory and then

594
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,000
prototypical describe

595
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:11,558
prototypical prototypical is things like

596
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,599
jackers and hazes right they have that

597
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:17,240
citrusy piny terpenic note very

598
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:19,639
quintessential like sativa types if you

599
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,400
would frame it as such a sense um as

600
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,840
well as ogs on the other prototypical

601
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,519
Spectrum having that really Woody earthy

602
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:32,480
gassy and some Pine Citrus notes to it

603
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,599
um and more even some other cultivars

604
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,319
that have like the spicy notes spicy

605
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,759
herbal notes right like either some

606
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:42,278
things like hemp which are very herbal

607
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,119
spicy or even other things like gorilla

608
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:45,919
glues that again these are all good

609
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,959
cavars they're just not exotic but

610
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,360
they're very spicy very earthy and

611
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,240
herbaceous and with some floral notes to

612
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,558
it so that's like your prototypical

613
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,038
exotic has that may have those similar

614
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:02,879
bases but layered on top of it are those

615
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:05,679
fruity Esters or heterocycles like indol

616
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,600
and Scat all yeah and I was going to ask

617
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,000
you that and you know I think when I

618
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,599
edit this I'm going to put up the uh

619
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,319
visual that you have in the paper that

620
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,000
sort of shows a spectrum of all these

621
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,480
different types of cannabis with

622
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,919
different Peaks for for different um

623
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,798
different Aroma notes because I think

624
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,080
it's really it's really great job you

625
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,759
guys did putting this together so is it

626
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:30,558
fair to say that the prototypical ones

627
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,119
might have fewer of these non- turpenoid

628
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:37,240
volatile compounds they're more sort of

629
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:40,719
reliant on the tpin or or

630
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,120
no so in the context of like hazes and

631
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,759
Jack Herer for sure right it has it

632
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,959
doesn't mean it's devoid of all Esters

633
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,519
and other compounds they still have like

634
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,480
hazes tend to have a lot of cherry

635
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,240
propanol in there which is it offers a

636
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,839
mild tiny amount of fru because they

637
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,000
have just a small amount of in there but

638
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:00,798
these are these are cold ours that have

639
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,880
been around a while and they

640
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,278
weren't they were they were never really

641
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,240
bred to have more exotic fruity notes

642
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,599
right these are really classical strains

643
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,558
that have been around a while that

644
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,119
really own that specific flavor notes of

645
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,720
and they do drive a lot derive a lot

646
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:19,719
from Turpin you're again things like

647
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,200
Alpha pining for Pine turpening for

648
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,000
those terpenic notes lemoning others for

649
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,159
some of those citrusy notes that are in

650
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,119
combination with the other tpin that are

651
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,720
there now

652
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,759
other prototypical like ogs gorilla

653
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,880
glues that are they do have a skunky

654
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,960
gasy notes so they do have prated vscs

655
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,640
that aren't tpin they do have a lot of

656
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,159
tpin there that give a lot of its Bas

657
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,720
note but it does have that really strong

658
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,640
defining Aroma that everybody even

659
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,519
non-cannabis consumers know that's

660
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,759
skunky note or gassy note depending on

661
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:57,240
how you perceive it that's coming from

662
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,960
the prenol sulfur compounds that are not

663
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,558
turbines

664
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,278
okay so now you mentioned before that

665
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:09,038
you I want to make sure I got this right

666
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:12,679
you removed the tpin and then smelled it

667
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:14,679
and it was sort of um strange have you

668
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,000
done the opposite where you sort of

669
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:19,480
eliminate these non-terpenoid compounds

670
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,079
and leave just the trines or is that

671
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,000
sort of obvious because we have isolated

672
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:29,240
tpin so we've done both right when we

673
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,679
were first on our on our uh our paper

674
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,000
uh the the penol VC's the gas paper we

675
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,679
on our sensory panel did did some that

676
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,519
were without penol sulfur compounds so

677
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,159
just turpins and some that had it and it

678
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:46,079
still has like that Bassy cannabis tpine

679
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,440
note that's there it just feels

680
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,599
incomplete it feels like it is not a

681
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,919
full profile it doesn't have some of

682
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,599
those defining features as a consumer

683
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,679
that you would be looking for so when we

684
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:00,839
added the penal to VC's

685
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,200
it definitely got a lot closer and so we

686
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,199
went into the Exotic ones when you add

687
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,120
in more of those other flavoring you're

688
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,558
just getting closer and closer to that

689
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,599
concept of like biomimicry of getting

690
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:13,158
really close to replicating that exact

691
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,719
flavor and Aroma of the plant whether

692
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,440
it's for creating a product or just

693
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,519
improving your extraction but when you

694
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,038
do strip out like all those tpin it's

695
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,038
because Esters are really there for

696
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:28,679
complexing that base out to give it that

697
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,798
fruity Nuance when you consume cannabis

698
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,278
doesn't taste like you're literally

699
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:34,720
eating a strawberry it definitely has

700
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,558
strawberry notes to it but it has other

701
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,038
flavor notes of the turpins that are

702
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:42,200
there or in some cases the prenol V's in

703
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:45,359
the context of like some of the gassy

704
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,159
strawberry cultivars so if you remove

705
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:50,199
out the gassy component and all the

706
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,200
turpins it just is it just it does taste

707
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,558
weird it's it doesn't taste like a real

708
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,519
strawberry by any means or a real fruit

709
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,720
but it does taste like this just weird

710
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,679
mixture of somewhat rudiness but just no

711
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,240
defining

712
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,120
features and now so we mentioned before

713
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,000
that obviously genetics plays a huge

714
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:12,678
role in this but is how the Cannabis is

715
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,798
grown or you know you know how good the

716
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,440
grower is does that sort of contribute

717
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,200
to how much of these sort of

718
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,679
non-terpenoid compounds are going to be

719
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,080
uh

720
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,840
present I'm definitely not a cultivator

721
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,839
by any means but um I would assume so

722
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,798
yeah like he's because the plant isn't

723
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,398
just

724
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,398
producing these automatically right

725
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,798
these are secondary metabolites meaning

726
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,759
the plant is producing it for some

727
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,278
biological reason it also needs

728
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:41,679
nutrients to grow and produce these

729
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:44,640
compounds so I'd imagine depending on

730
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,320
what nutrients you feed it is going to

731
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,440
impact the expression of some of these

732
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:53,158
secondary metabolites um I imagine light

733
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,440
potentially impacts it right the when

734
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,760
you how you cure it definitely impacts

735
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,798
it if you overdry something these are a

736
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,319
lot of the are really volatile what

737
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,599
makes it to the end consumer may not

738
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,519
have it anymore because it got too dry

739
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,839
or the packaging wasn't properly sealed

740
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,960
there's a whole variety of things that

741
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:15,000
could impact especially in the Raw

742
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,480
biomass like the actual flower itself um

743
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,679
if it has these by the time it makes it

744
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,720
to the end consumer and genetically

745
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,960
would love to know I know from talking

746
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,798
to Kevin over medicinal genomics that's

747
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,960
a really complicated question there's a

748
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:29,960
lot involved there right

749
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:36,038
absolutely now is there any potential

750
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,880
for these compounds to maybe serve sort

751
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:39,919
of a therapeutic function I know that

752
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,200
there's been thoughts about tpin in the

753
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,480
past and there's been studies that sort

754
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,880
of look into linking Turpin to certain

755
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,759
uh therapeutic value and you know the

756
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,320
data is a little inconclusive um but I

757
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,839
know that there's with can flavens and

758
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,638
other things that there is some

759
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,439
potential there so could these also show

760
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:03,119
some

761
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,240
promise every anything is possible right

762
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:09,398
I mean do we know today if any of these

763
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,679
compounds have a specific medical impact

764
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:14,119
in the context of cannabis and we don't

765
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,399
know the definitive answer today but it

766
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,479
doesn't mean that they don't have an

767
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:20,599
impact and they' possibly mind right I

768
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,679
mean consumers are if they're purchasing

769
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:25,558
from a medical purpose this is and this

770
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,919
is also what drives us publishing some

771
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,720
of this data if you're purchasing

772
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,120
Canabis based on a medical ailment and

773
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,038
you have your specific cultivar you know

774
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:37,319
is what you need to help um treat your

775
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,158
ailment then you you would need it's

776
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:40,759
based on I would imagine some of these

777
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:42,760
secondary metabolites right that's why

778
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:44,359
you're choosing that specific cultivar

779
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:47,398
because that's what works for your body

780
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:49,278
on the market a lot of THC content is I

781
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,638
mean most cultivars are really high in

782
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,880
THC that doesn't normally typically

783
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:55,839
change too much yes you have some that

784
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,480
are either CBD rich or have miners but

785
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,918
the broad majority of cannabis tends to

786
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,200
be phc Rich right the thing that tends

787
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,120
to differentiate are sometimes some of

788
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:09,798
the turpins in the context of hazes vers

789
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:12,158
some exotic or um ogs but also these are

790
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:14,158
secondary metabolites and who knows

791
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,440
right we've seen Publications from Day

792
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,679
Day Mi that show some extracts have

793
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,120
better um anti-cancer properties than

794
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:27,240
others the THC and CBD may be the same

795
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:28,959
but everything else there is not so what

796
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,519
is causing those differences because the

797
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,399
data shows there are differences we may

798
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,519
just not understand what exactly that is

799
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:38,278
yet and maybe they play in in

800
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:40,278
combination with THC maybe having the

801
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,599
cannaboids present with these various

802
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:44,679
flavorants is what unlocks those medical

803
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:47,439
benefits there's a lot of questions to

804
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,360
be asked and answered still but now that

805
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,519
we understand more about what's in the

806
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,638
plant we can at least start asking these

807
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,839
questions and answering some of them

808
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:59,558
yeah and now from a consumer

809
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:02,359
perspective do you think it'd be

810
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:04,359
valuable to start reporting on different

811
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,798
levels of these certain compounds or

812
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,798
that be sort of Too Deep In The Weeds or

813
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,798
should we just should we just smell it

814
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,839
and if it smells good then we kind of

815
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:16,879
let the nose do the analytics for us so

816
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,480
I mean I'd say two ANS that one

817
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,240
definitely depends on the market right

818
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,159
there's some markets where you can smell

819
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,919
cannabis before you buy it like organ

820
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,519
it's deli style you can smell anything

821
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,360
you want before you buy it California we

822
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,240
don't have that luxury anymore it's all

823
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,959
prepackaged so you have no idea what

824
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,839
it's going to smell or taste like before

825
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,960
you buy it you have to commit to buying

826
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,879
that 30

827
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,600
50100 product before you even know if

828
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,440
you're even going to like it right and

829
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,558
so we've asked ourselves this question

830
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,840
for the past three four years now like

831
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,079
is this are these compounds meaningful

832
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:53,199
to an end consumer and I think it's

833
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:55,519
tough there's a lot of compounds in here

834
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,960
as I mean we are obviously we're a

835
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,278
tpping flavor company we understand and

836
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,600
we should know more about this than

837
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,278
everybody but even internally like if I

838
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:06,278
was to go into a store and see all these

839
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:09,199
flavorant on there I mean I might know

840
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:10,639
just because I worked on this study but

841
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,319
a lot wouldn't just because there's so

842
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,639
many that's we've worked on um taking

843
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,760
that complex data because we have the GC

844
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,800
data and the sensory data from these

845
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,879
studies and seeing if we can come with

846
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,119
more meaningful ways to um simplify and

847
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:28,960
deliver this um information or

848
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:31,320
meaningful matter like how exotic or how

849
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,559
fruity is this cannabis cultivar on a 0

850
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,800
to 100 right we know it has ethylate

851
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,039
methyl annihilate three mer capto

852
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,399
hexanol if I put those on a bottle the

853
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:43,039
consumers like what is this right what

854
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:44,960
dangerous things are you giving me right

855
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,440
because it's just it sounds scary I'm a

856
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,639
chemist so it doesn't sound scary to me

857
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,358
but I'm not foolish enough to think that

858
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,320
all consumers understand all these

859
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:55,279
chemicals but if you can put in one

860
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,680
meaningful Factor like how gassy is this

861
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,440
how fruity is this how hazy is this like

862
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,159
and we've done this with some of the

863
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,240
products we work on in California um it

864
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,719
does have a at least more simplified

865
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:09,559
approach and again just looking at

866
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,838
cannabis having hundreds of

867
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:14,199
compounds and having on there it has

868
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,358
this many micrograms of this compound

869
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:18,559
right it's gonna be tough It's it' be

870
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:22,039
really tough if you unless you were to

871
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:24,480
deconvolute it in in a more educated

872
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:26,838
manner yeah and then you know layer on

873
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,639
top of that the way that they interact

874
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:31,599
with each other produce a different uh

875
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:33,598
Aroma too like there's no way that the

876
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,880
average person would be able to figure

877
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,240
that out I mean I'd even argue unless

878
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,160
you're like somebody who spent their

879
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,239
career in flavor chemistry or flavor

880
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,759
science or

881
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,439
perfumes really nobody would because

882
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,839
there's so many unless you are somebody

883
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,800
who's constantly making products and

884
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:54,519
flavors or perfumes to just look at a

885
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,760
these these long names with percent or

886
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,800
it wouldn't mean percentage points all

887
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,920
these are PPM level because it it's tiny

888
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,560
right yeah exactly and know that hey

889
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,000
with having these 30 compounds in there

890
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:08,159
and also like think about yourself going

891
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,760
to dispenser you're looking at maybe 10

892
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,318
to 20 different products by the time you

893
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,280
make a purchasing decision if if you're

894
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:16,719
looking at a sheet with 20 30 different

895
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,319
compounds on it across 20 different

896
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,679
products that's a lot of information

897
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:24,800
digest yeah I mean I it would just be

898
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:28,559
overwhelming to really most people or I

899
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,280
just thinking about a new entry consumer

900
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,159
talk about something incredibly daunting

901
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,440
right you're putting a pretty in pretty

902
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,759
daunting task in front of them unless

903
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,559
this again what we've been working on

904
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,280
inside my group is how do we take that

905
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,199
complex information because we have all

906
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,839
this data to support it and put in

907
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,439
something more digestible and more

908
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:48,480
simple so people can again go on there

909
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,039
hey I want something fruity and exotic

910
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,199
well cool let's that's what you like

911
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,000
well let's look at all these different

912
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:56,480
say fruit Factor scores or exotic scores

913
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,800
yeah um which one has the highest or

914
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,079
maybe have a spe which one has the

915
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,440
certain flavor and aroman notes you're

916
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:06,519
looking for excellent so winding down

917
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,200
here so what is it that you in the team

918
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,599
at abstracts are are looking to do with

919
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,598
this

920
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:16,119
information I mean first obviously we're

921
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,720
using this to make try and get our

922
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,640
cannabis flavor products to have higher

923
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,519
levels of biomimicry getting closer to

924
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,838
replicating that exact flavor and Aroma

925
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:27,599
of the plant um we we want to use this

926
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:30,400
this information to improve our

927
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,000
extraction processes whether that be

928
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,680
tackling cannabis or if we want to

929
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,599
extract some other plant like hops if we

930
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:37,960
now that we understand these chemical

931
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,119
these compounds that are there we have

932
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,400
the GC methods we understand the sensory

933
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,280
behind it can we use this to improve

934
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,079
extracts and lastly I mean taking all

935
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,640
this data we've arated from our few

936
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:53,400
studies now can we come up with and we

937
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:55,358
have come up with some um met consumer

938
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,920
facing metrics for cannabis cultivars

939
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,279
that explain what something smells taste

940
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,318
like before you purchase it for so for

941
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,319
markets like California where you are

942
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:08,000
relying on a bud tender hoping they've

943
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:10,119
consume that product they may not have

944
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,880
right dispensary has hundreds of

945
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:16,160
products but if we can provide education

946
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,920
for consumers to make more educated

947
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,318
decisions excellent all right and Before

948
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,559
I Let You Go I want to give you the

949
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:25,159
chance to plug any additional resources

950
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:28,599
that you think the audience might be

951
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:30,639
interested in in reading up on and any

952
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:33,240
websites social media for you and

953
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,000
abstracts please plug away yeah so if

954
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,159
you want to read any of our Publications

955
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,039
anytime we do a scientific peer viiew

956
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,920
publication we always make sure to put

957
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,519
it up for Open Access that way everybody

958
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,880
in the industry can benefit from this

959
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:47,880
work to improve their processes products

960
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,960
or just better understand cannabis

961
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,680
because we all enjoy it and it's a lot

962
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,199
of fun um on abstract.com under that's

963
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,598
where we hold all our products under our

964
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:58,799
science Pages we have not only the work

965
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,599
I've talked about here but some of the

966
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,160
other case studies we've worked on

967
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,440
worked on a couple case studies looking

968
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,960
at what makes Jack Herer smell and taste

969
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,440
the way it does looked at understanding

970
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,519
when you do different extracts of what's

971
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,280
the between flower live resin of a

972
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:17,000
butane extraction or live rosin of the

973
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,200
same Cult of our grown the same way we

974
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,639
just took that lot and split it up we

975
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,239
have case studies like that up on our

976
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,679
website that again we publish these open

977
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:27,039
they're free for anybody to download and

978
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:29,799
read just we find them interesting hope

979
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,318
everybody does too that's awesome and we

980
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,599
definitely appreciate the fact that you

981
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:36,039
guys do that um and that you guys

982
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,760
continue to participate in canmed we're

983
