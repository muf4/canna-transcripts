1
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:11,580
great location you guys have stepped it

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,160
up year after year I don't know that you

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,079
can do much better than this but looking

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,839
forward to seeing what happens next year

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,899
hopefully it'll be the same location

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,820
this this is an amazing I mean last

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,099
couple years we're in Pasadena Pasadena

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,260
is a fine City

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,220
they got the Rose Bowl Parade and all

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,460
that but

11
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:35,700
Marco Island is the next level and it's

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,079
a beautiful place beaches are white you

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,899
know people can come into our conference

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,840
they can bring their families and

15
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:44,820
participate it's a very beautiful place

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,399
it takes that much time and that close

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,200
proximity to keep everyone together this

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,780
would not happen in Las Vegas

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,820
and it's beautiful out here

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,100
I mean please do it here again next year

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,738
and in fact I love it so much that I'm

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,558
staying until Saturday

23
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:04,079
I extended my trip by like four days so

24
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,060
I could enjoy this because I mean I

25
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,519
would have never come here if it weren't

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,439
for this conference and I've never been

27
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,179
here before so it's fabulous

28
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,779
a great choice for this kind of

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,060
conference the the

30
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,579
calmness of the area and the beauty of

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,140
the area gave a little bit of my opinion

32
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,819
uh focus and concentration for us to to

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,460
at the same time have a great time and

34
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,978
then being able to to do our discussions

35
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,618
in a better way

36
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:37,099
it's a beautiful location I'm quite

37
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:40,019
impressed with this whole

38
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:42,438
complex that we are at and it's been

39
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:45,420
very well organized very professional

40
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:46,819
you know I have run meetings through my

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,920
career

42
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:52,139
on a yearly basis and this is quite

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,599
impressive I think I'll bring some of my

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,680
other societies here one day because it

45
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,679
has worked out quite well
