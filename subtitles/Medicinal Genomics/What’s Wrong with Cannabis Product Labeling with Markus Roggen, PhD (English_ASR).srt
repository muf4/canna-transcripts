at cam mid 23 Marcus will be presenting

52
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,580
the topic of birds bees and buds how to

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,720
talk about cannabis and how to label it

54
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,360
correctly

55
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,340
during our conversation we discuss some

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,440
of the issues with current cannabis

57
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,239
labeling as well as some potential

58
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,239
alternatives

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,120
more specifically we discuss how THC

60
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,580
percentage is miscalculated the fact

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,819
that only a fraction of the THC in

62
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,219
cannabis flour is actually consumed

63
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:53,159
how joint architecture affects the

64
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:56,340
amount of THC the smoker consumes

65
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:59,159
why the ABV percentage in alcohol and

66
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,539
the THC percentage in cannabis are not

67
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,359
one in the same

68
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,818
and how establishing a standard unit of

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,580
cannabis products May shift the focus

70
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:11,518
away from THC percentage and towards

71
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,719
things like Aroma terpene profiles and

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,640
flavor

73
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,739
before we get to my conversation with

74
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,979

good afternoon Marcus thanks so much for

100
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,620
joining us on the podcast yet again

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,720
thank you for having me yet again

102
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,939
all right so you have a problem with

103
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,860
cannabis labeling you've written several

104
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,079
articles on the topic and you're going

105
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,560
to be presenting about it at cam med23

106
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,120
so let's let's get into it what is wrong

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,860
with the current way that we label

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,939
cannabis

109
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,979
a lot uh and uh you have to come to the

110
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:05,399
event in Florida to like hear all about

111
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:07,680
it uh but here I will give you a a quick

112
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,560
uh summary of it

113
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,879
um before I give away what is wrong with

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,220
it

115
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,199
except everything uh let me explain

116
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,979
where I come from

117
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,780
so I came to the Cannabis industry out

118
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:23,399
of University just finished my postdoc

119
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,679
in chemistry

120
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:28,500
um and I've no personal background in

121
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,720
cannabis so I came to it new and fresh

122
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,360
and

123
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,740
so I I might have looked at things a

124
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,560
little different and it's like not

125
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,060
that's why normal normally people would

126
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,860
say oh that's the way it's always been I

127
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,500
was like why do you do this and so I

128
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,060
started asking things uh with my main

129
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,339
research field of cannabis extraction

130
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,100
right that's where most of my work comes

131
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,119
from but it then also dawned on me at

132
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,400
some point

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,399
that the way cannabis

134
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,038
um is labeled

135
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,660
um is mathematically wrong so that's how

136
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,839
it started because

137
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:07,020
um you see on on flower labels that

138
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:10,978
there is a total THC value or a total

139
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:13,620
CBD but effectively every cannabis

140
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:18,839
cultivar nowadays is just pure THC so

141
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:21,060
total THC and um total THC is made up of

142
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,279
the natural produced THC asset that's in

143
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,500
the flower and then THC that that

144
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,019
happens after decarboxylation which

145
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,759
hasn't happened yet in the flower but

146
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,198
it's the compound you get when you smoke

147
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,720
and you want because that's

148
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
incontoxicated and instead of labeling

149
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,759
this is how much THC is in a THC acid is

150
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,379
in there but people want THC people came

151
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,300
up with a total THC number because

152
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,060
there's a weight difference between THC

153
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,720
acid and THC so therefore they are

154
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,720
correcting this

155
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,100
and when I was explaining this to my

156
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,918
fellow researchers who really have no

157
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,800
background in cannabis and just uh

158
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,719
students at the University in British

159
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,500
Columbia at UBC

160
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,199
um

161
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,600
I stumbled over the point realizing that

162
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:10,680
the weight correction is done

163
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,720
for the THC acid weight loss

164
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,519
but not for the weight loss of the

165
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,259
sample

166
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,959
so it's mathematically incorrect because

167
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:22,259
you're forgetting the denominator

168
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:26,279
the best example is if you take pure THC

169
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:28,379
acid Crystal like a pure THC acid

170
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:32,098
Crystal you would normally think yeah

171
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:34,259
that's pure THC right THC asset THC is

172
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:38,339
like it's Purity it should be there for

173
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:40,560
100 THC or total 100 total THC

174
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,478
but by the mathematical formula it would

175
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,139
be

176
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:48,478
87.7 total THC which makes no sense

177
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,439
right how can a pure compound not be

178
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,879
pure

179
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,279
right

180
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,740
and and so autonomy you're forgetting

181
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,478
this uh denominator and you're not

182
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,939
correcting for mass and so I wrote about

183
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,918
this but when I then started thinking

184
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,538
about this does that have any influence

185
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,779
I realized

186
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:10,439
the whole industry

187
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:12,299
sells its products based on one number

188
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,240
total THC

189
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,160
unfortunately yeah aside from Total THC

190
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,960
being mathematically wrong and I find

191
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,020
this as a scientist interesting but I

192
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,299
think the general public thinks uh geek

193
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:26,579
uh or nerd and moves on

194
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,460
the general public should be interested

195
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:33,259
in the fact that cannabis is just sold

196
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:35,879
as one number it's total THC

197
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:37,979
and yes that's what the customer wants

198
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,240
but that's also what the we educated the

199
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,139
customer about

200
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,839
right

201
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:45,360
and there's a strong reason why that is

202
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,100
because THC was the is the main

203
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,560
intoxicating compound and it was like

204
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,019
the first one we could test for so we

205
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:55,018
saw it we made a number we bred for it

206
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:57,480
we focused everything on it

207
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,339
but

208
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,879
if you take parallels to other

209
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,880
Industries

210
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,959
alcohol is not bored by

211
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,120
the alcohol number in it

212
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:15,119
because if the highest number of alcohol

213
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,879
is what you are after then every time

214
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,620
you go into a wine store to buy

215
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,360
something you walk out with a bottle of

216
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,320
vodka right

217
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,820
and we should all drink ever Everclear

218
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,519
and

219
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,200
and the U.S shouldn't drink any

220
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,560
Budweiser

221
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,240
or Pop's Blue Ribbon because German bee

222
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,739
has more alcohol and I generally can't

223
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,899
understand why you wouldn't why you

224
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,240
drink American Beer not German beer but

225
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,320
that's a different story

226
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,100
so

227
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:51,120
this focus of total THC

228
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:54,180
is preventing the industry from

229
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,500
building on its

230
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:59,039
um

231
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,899
aspect of flavor like the there is the

232
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,759
intoxicating aspect of cannabis but then

233
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,679
there's the connoisseur the high quality

234
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,659
the the craft cannabis that everyone

235
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:10,319
talks about but then you only sell it as

236
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:14,039
such THC right it's like so

237
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,260
that was my my internal

238
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,799
conflict

239
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:22,200
um that then made me think about how

240
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:25,379
could we correct that

241
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,019
right no

242
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,820
and it's interesting too I mean when you

243
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,320
mentioned that it's just the way that

244
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,480
it's always been and you know people

245
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,000
might not be questioning in it

246
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,339
um I'll be completely honest I hadn't

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
actually really considered

248
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,399
the way that we're reporting THC potency

249
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
um until I started reading through what

250
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,159
you've written getting ready for this

251
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,079
interview and I hadn't actually

252
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:52,319
considered what that percentage actually

253
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:54,958
means but when you think about it and

254
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,519
the parallel to I think alcohol kind of

255
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,078
drives this home

256
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,060
at least in my mind you could tell me if

257
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,338
I'm wrong but you know alcohol by volume

258
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,500
kind of makes sense right if it's eight

259
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,360
percent then okay I'm gonna drink this

260
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,000
liquid and you could calculate what

261
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,440
percent or what volume actually of

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,139
alcohol I'm ingesting but when it it

263
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,200
when you see THC percentage on a flower

264
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:21,299
you're not just eating that flour you're

265
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,100
you're burning it you're decarboxylating

266
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,259
it it's it's sort of a different method

267
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,600
of ingestion and is that part of the

268
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,059
problem as well is that you know that

269
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,620
percent number isn't actually

270
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,139
you know telling you what you're

271
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,200
actually going to be consuming

272
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,799
you're absolutely correct so

273
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,959
um

274
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,139
that's my advantage I have my own

275
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,939
research lab so I can actually test and

276
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,379
measure things

277
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,660
so

278
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,639
for the last few years we are doing

279
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,740
smoke research so we have a robot that

280
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,838
smokes a joint we can put therefore a

281
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,539
joint or a vape cartridge to this robot

282
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,640
and then capture what comes out and we

283
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,559
can measure puff puff and for the whole

284
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,480
joint

285
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:07,259
and

286
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,139
we we recently did studies on seeing if

287
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:12,539
the the particle size of the flower

288
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,939
that you put into a joint so if you if

289
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:17,039
you break up a flower Bud into big

290
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,360
chunks or really fine powdery chunks

291
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,278
right

292
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,579
does that make a difference in the

293
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:26,278
inhalation of THC

294
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,259
and it does if you have a fine powder in

295
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,639
your joint you inhale double the amount

296
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:33,179
of THC

297
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:36,360
for the first few Puffs then you do

298
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:39,299
for large chunks so one millimeter was

299
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,419
five millimeter particle size

300
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:44,899
so and it's the same flower

301
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:47,759
and then in addition the small particle

302
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:49,379
The Joint Burns quicker and then the

303
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,659
large particle

304
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,539
the burns slower and you get more Puffs

305
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:57,000
out of it so overall you inhale more THC

306
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:59,219
for the large chunks

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,440
when you smoke the whole joint but if

308
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:06,120
you just take one or two Puffs then the

309
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:10,260
small particle size is the right one so

310
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,320
this notion I buy a I buy a pre-roll

311
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:16,319
joint with 25

312
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:20,220
THC is better better in air quotes

313
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,920
because it gets me higher than a 19 th

314
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,339
total THC joint

315
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:28,439
is wrong because the architecture makes

316
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,740
a big difference right a particle size

317
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,220
packing density we also looked at water

318
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,980
content and how that affects it right

319
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,560
and

320
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:43,139
and so having

321
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,899
a percentage number for an inhalable

322
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:48,000
product that is burned

323
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,039
um doesn't really make much sense

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,120
because it doesn't directly correlate to

325
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:56,939
how much you inhale and also side note

326
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,879
when you smoke a joint

327
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,600
you maybe get 20 percent

328
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,338
of all the THC that's in the joint so if

329
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,500
we say that a joint has a hundred

330
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,500
milligram of THC in that flower

331
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:14,700
and you smoke it you inhale 20

332
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:17,700
milligrams of THC

333
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,620
wow over the course of it the rest is

334
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,540
destroyed

335
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,600
um goes into the room

336
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,819
sticks to the paper we haven't found

337
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,200
every single milligram of THC yet where

338
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,600
where it goes but not all a substantial

339
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,180
amount of the Cannabis of the THC that's

340
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,200
in the Cannabis joint doesn't make it to

341
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,519
your mouth

342
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,740
interesting

343
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,600
and then we could also discuss if you

344
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,159
inhale it does it actually reach your

345
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,500
bloodstream

346
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,980
it's more biological question and and

347
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:54,980
part of the ideas that we had for for

348
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:57,240
different uh ways of labeling it but uh

349
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,240
when we are talking

350
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,399
about how to labor cannabis better and

351
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,159
my position comes from

352
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,839
having done the math having done the

353
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,879
the chemistry experiment actually

354
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,579
measuring stuff

355
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,879
um and and so I think I can

356
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:19,138
speak from presume Authority saying the

357
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,519
current way is wrong

358
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,560
right

359
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,500
and now if I understand correctly so if

360
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:29,159
I have you know I have 25 flour right

361
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,919
and I roll one one gram joint with very

362
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,379
fine particles and another one with

363
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,539
bigger chunks and I consume both

364
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:39,720
entirely right

365
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:42,539
in different sessions I'm sure but I'm

366
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,180
gonna get a different amount of THC from

367
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:48,480
one versus the other just based on yes

368
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:50,698
how the particles are wow yes

369
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,220
and so and that's just joints right what

370
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:55,979
about you know if you're using a

371
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,778
um a bowl or a bong or a vaporizer are

372
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,940
those all you know

373
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:03,899
different

374
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:07,199
very likely but we have sofa only done

375
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:10,500
research on joints and vape cartridges

376
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,599
oh fun fact a vape cartridge and a joint

377
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,799
are about the same amount of THC per

378
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,339
Puff

379
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,338
okay

380
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,259
so it's not that the 90s on the particle

381
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,800
size though right

382
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,659
there are error bars on everything so

383
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,578
they are within the same area so it's

384
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,799
not like you inhale one milligram for a

385
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:34,019
joint and 10 milligrams for a vape

386
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,479
cartridge you inhaled somewhere between

387
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,060
half a milligram to two milligrams in

388
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,480
both cases depending on the the flower

389
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:45,059
the mill size the oil the hardware but

390
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,459
it's it's somewhere in the same region

391
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:49,619
and is that independent of what the THC

392
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,879
percentage is of the flower

393
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,159
yeah

394
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,778
yeah so we tried different we we bought

395
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,338
different pre-rolls you can buy in the

396
00:16:54,778 --> 00:17:00,299
store and we made some from our own

397
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:03,240
flower uh stock in the safe and and this

398
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:05,818
yes there are factors of one or two two

399
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,880
or three in in air so like half a

400
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:10,678
milligram versus two milligrams but uh

401
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,419
when we think in scientific terms we

402
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,019
normally think in orders of magnitude so

403
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:19,880
is it one ten hundred right that size

404
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:23,519
steps and it's all within the the one

405
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,459
problems so really that percentage

406
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,199
difference that you see you know in

407
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,240
different products it doesn't really

408
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,058
translate in terms of

409
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,798
you know in actuality no and it's not

410
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:36,678
and an important part it's not directly

411
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,720
correlated so it's not that the 19

412
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,980
flower gives you less of a buzz than the

413
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,538
25 percent

414
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,900
flower

415
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:47,940
because architecture again joint

416
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,740
architecture and in under joint

417
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,840
architecture I go particle side packing

418
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,980
density water content

419
00:17:51,839 --> 00:18:01,558
um paper uh mouthpiece right everything

420
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:05,759
wow um and that also means that the

421
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:10,139
around 20 percent THC flour

422
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:12,000
and the 90 percent

423
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,880
cannabis oil

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,519
from a vape cartridge still gives you

425
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,980
the same amount of THC per puff so all

426
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,339
the politicians that say that joint that

427
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,960
that cannabis is getting too strong

428
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:28,678
[Music]

429
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:31,860
they see oh 90 Vape cartridges

430
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,200
but then the Vape cards gives you

431
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,719
the same again per puff because if you

432
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,480
smoke a whole whole Vape card that has

433
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,339
like 400 Puffs on it

434
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,038
um

435
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:48,178
that is going to give you a bigger bus

436
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:51,298
or a total amount of THC but

437
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,400
I would say that very very few people

438
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:56,819
can smoke a whole Vape card in one

439
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,220
sitting okay yeah well I know they

440
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:01,558
exists

441
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,900
but I I would say that more people can

442
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,460
smoke a whole joint than that they can

443
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,519
smoke a hole

444
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,500
yeah and I mean and so what about the

445
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,019
whole idea that at least anecdotally

446
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,759
people who may have may have used

447
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,139
cannabis back in college or high school

448
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,579
and now they're coming back to it and

449
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,919
they buy something from the dispensary

450
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:22,319
and they think wow this is way more

451
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,660
potent than I remember it being

452
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,460
that might be the case that might be the

453
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,200
case I'm sure there's an inflection

454
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,679
point if you have like three percent THC

455
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,798
versus 20 THC I I go with that

456
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,798
um

457
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:42,080
and I'm not old enough to be those

458
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:44,759
in college back then

459
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,500
theoretically I went well effectively I

460
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,779
went directly from college to cannabis

461
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,480
so I can't really say

462
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:53,220
and I actually never smoked myself so

463
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,460
really difficult

464
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,860
but there's also the aspect that you

465
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,720
lose your

466
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:04,019
um your tolerance when you're losing

467
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,259
your tolerance to THC or to cannabis in

468
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:08,700
general it takes about a week maybe 10

469
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:12,720
days

470
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:16,140
of not consuming at all to lose most of

471
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,960
your tolerance to the drug

472
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,780
so the kids that might have in college

473
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,819
dabbled with a few joints so therefore

474
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:26,279
where regular users

475
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:28,740
and have built up a tolerance and then

476
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,500
don't smoke for 30 years they lost all

477
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,660
the tolerance so is it just the I lost

478
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,700
my tolerance or is it really stronger

479
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,038
and and I leave other and let others

480
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,980
decide on that yeah that's a fair point

481
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,359
and we didn't have I mean at least when

482
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,700
I was in college we didn't have

483
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:47,279
laboratory tested

484
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,679
um cannabis either so we didn't I mean I

485
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,899
have no idea what the percentage was of

486
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,340
that back then so it very well could

487
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,140
have been three or five percent who

488
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,159
knows

489
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,919
um

490
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,380
so I think we've done a good job kind of

491
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,820
establishing what's wrong with labeling

492
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,860
at least and this is only just in flower

493
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:06,659
and I know you have you know comments on

494
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:09,779
the tinctures and other things too but

495
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,700
so let's let's talk about what ways we

496
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,960
could we could do better or some ideas

497
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:18,419
that you've had

498
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:23,640
yeah so my my base uh base thought is

499
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:26,100
don't sell it as the high number of THC

500
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,460
but you still need

501
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,899
to inform about the amount of THC

502
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,440
present

503
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,440
right

504
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,140
because that the regulator requires that

505
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,700
right so there needs to be a THC warning

506
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,400
unit there is package sizing

507
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,538
particularly in food and tincture

508
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,980
settings

509
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:48,480
so

510
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,620
um

511
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,620
if you sell it

512
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,440
package it by THC

513
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,159
uh amount but

514
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:05,538
make it in a way that it's just

515
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,580
a given like a bottle size

516
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:12,058
let's go to just we we will switch

517
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:14,879
between cannabis and alcohol a lot

518
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:18,839
um so if you think about beer beer

519
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,600
always comes in the same volume

520
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,339
right it's the same bottle size so you

521
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,558
never really think about bottle sizes

522
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:27,959
you only think about oh today I just

523
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:30,240
want my own beer

524
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,679
um or if you're buying a wine like there

525
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,720
are small bottles and large bottles

526
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
right do I want just a wine bottle for

527
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,319
myself or do I want a wine bottle for

528
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,058
the whole table right so you buy the

529
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,099
different size bottle but otherwise you

530
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:46,500
don't think about the volume

531
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:48,719
so can we turn THC into a volume thing a

532
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,538
package size thing your standard size

533
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,079
because that yeah standard size so that

534
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:58,019
would allow us to to

535
00:22:55,079 --> 00:23:00,240
say yes there's THC and you're buying

536
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:02,700
the intoxicating part but let's now

537
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,579
focus on all the other cool things that

538
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,919
I'm in our cannabis product so that

539
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:09,480
you're like we got away from the THC now

540
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,120
let's talk about all the other things

541
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,579
that make our flower

542
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,579
better than the the rest in the store

543
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,879
and if you in Canada you can't do

544
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:23,400
advertisement you can't do fancy

545
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,780
labeling but you can inform about

546
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,080
testing

547
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:31,139
so okay so my I have two proposals for

548
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:34,939
for the THC question and that would be

549
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:38,400
either we take the idea of alcohol

550
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:42,419
the standard drink

551
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,000
so you would have a box

552
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:48,360
or a jar of flour

553
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,900
and in that jar it's not a gram or an

554
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:57,240
eighth but there is one or two servings

555
00:23:51,900 --> 00:24:00,360
of THC hmm so at that point it becomes

556
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,500
unimportant if the flower is 19 or 25

557
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:03,599
percent

558
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,919
because you always have the same amount

559
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,918
of THC in there

560
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,640
um and how we then Define the serving

561
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,399
size

562
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,740
um that can be we in the industry could

563
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,480
come up with an idea or work with

564
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,419
regulator on that

565
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,120
because we already have a serving size

566
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:25,259
in edibles

567
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,819
depending on which country or state

568
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:29,220
you're in that might be five milligrams

569
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:32,759
10 milligrams per serving

570
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,279
so if we think about that the standard

571
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,919
joint right now is one gram flour and

572
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,200
has 20 THC so let's say 200 milligrams

573
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,840
of THC

574
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,779
would be our serving size so we just

575
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:49,019
package each jar that has then 200

576
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,579
milligrams of THC

577
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,759
um and there therefore there might be

578
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:56,399
one gram or one and a half grams or only

579
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,259
0.8 grams of flour in there depending on

580
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,280
the concentration but you know that when

581
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:04,740
you consume this you theoretically

582
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:08,759
had the same amount of THC

583
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:11,279
And if every box from every supplier is

584
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,019
100 or 200 milligrams of THC you can

585
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,859
then start thinking

586
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:19,139
how about we by the one with the the

587
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:21,298
fruity terpenes or we buy the ones with

588
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,700
the with the skunky flavor which which

589
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:26,879
comes from thials

590
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:30,960
um or we do this from the local uh

591
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,020
grower so you can move away from THC and

592
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,419
think about other other things

593
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:38,579
because the Cannabis industry always

594
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:40,860
talks about the Entourage effect and all

595
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:43,500
the other flavors and then salsa that

596
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:45,538
talk to THC so like

597
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,240
let's try to like put this all together

598
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:50,700
and like do a con

599
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,759
consistent marketing messaging

600
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,400
yeah and so it so if I if I understand

601
00:25:53,759 --> 00:26:00,058
your point here like if you had a

602
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:05,820
standard serving size then I mean if you

603
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:09,658
had a 25 flower versus a 10 flower there

604
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:12,058
would be more actual biomass in the 10

605
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:15,120
right because you would need more of it

606
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:16,740
to reach that right ribbing size

607
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,899
right

608
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:23,159
okay right but

609
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:25,200
um it's similar to a uh to to be a wine

610
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,419
out and and vodka

611
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,600
you already know that the serving size

612
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,600
of beer is bigger than a shot of vodka

613
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,200
right so again that you are you're

614
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,120
supposedly consume the same amount of

615
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,659
alcohol

616
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:47,879
yeah a drink is a drink is a drink

617
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,500
yeah well you might be able to down a

618
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,778
vodka bottle quicker before you feel

619
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,579
full or intoxicated and then you have

620
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,480
consumed more alcohol but that's a

621
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,678
different

622
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,960
story

623
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,900
luckily

624
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,720
THC inhalation is very very quick in its

625
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,740
intoxication so over consumption is less

626
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,980
often

627
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,159
issue there

628
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,599
I understand it is an issue for

629
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,720
unexperienced users on the edible side

630
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,939
right that's why we have serving sizes

631
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,620
there yeah

632
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,679
no that's a good point

633
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:25,558
no and I think you know the the

634
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,600
correlation again to alcohol makes sense

635
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:31,319
when you're comparing beer versus wine

636
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:33,839
versus a spirit although

637
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,399
um what about craft beer in the fact

638
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,139
that you know some of these beers are

639
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,140
getting up to like nine percent alcohol

640
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,179
by volume so like the whole idea of you

641
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,778
know I drink one Budweiser and I feel a

642
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,880
certain way versus uh you know a one of

643
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:51,359
these craft beers that's nine percent is

644
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,278
that more of a a an apt comparison to

645
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,798
what we're seeing with cannabis in the

646
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:58,259
the differences in the percentages there

647
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:00,960
no because then Budweiser would have

648
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,940
gone bankrupt if that would be the case

649
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,079
because that's what currently happens to

650
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,120
all the

651
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,119
cannabis producers that can't make a

652
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:11,099
flower over 20 mm-hmm

653
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,719
right so people are buying a Budweiser

654
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,418
not because of the alcohol content but

655
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,038
for another reason

656
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,960
I think I'm not lying they buy it for an

657
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,179
alcohol content otherwise the the

658
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,940
alcohol-free Budweiser would be selling

659
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,400
uh massively

660
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,798
true but I'm just saying if the one like

661
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,840
like we see in cannabis the kind of the

662
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,900
sole determining factor of quote-unquote

663
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:36,000
quality is your is your THC percentage

664
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,559
that's not the case in alcohol or else

665
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,558
Budweiser wouldn't be the most popular

666
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,538
I'm German so I find it difficult to

667
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:48,119
find quality in American BS but a

668
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:50,359
different story so I said popular not

669
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,359
better

670
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,500
the

671
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
the

672
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:01,319
alcohol user

673
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:03,778
or alcohol consumer is aware that there

674
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:05,819
is more to the drink than just the the

675
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:08,759
alcohol number

676
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:11,879
and therefore craft beers that go to

677
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:14,339
nine percent or there's some Stark beer

678
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,278
in Germany and Scotland where they have

679
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:20,699
gotten over 30 alcohol content yeah

680
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:25,079
they're using freeze drying to do that

681
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:28,140
it's very laborious but again

682
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,099
if you if you want a craft beer with

683
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,659
more

684
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:33,178
um

685
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:36,840
then you might do so but

686
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,980
that might be more a question of do I

687
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,480
want

688
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,538
a wine

689
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,599
or beer of that alcohol content then

690
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:48,538
saying I just want to drink

691
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,639
five glasses of beer today do I take

692
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:52,019
butt or the nine percent craft beer I

693
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,299
think that's not really the question you

694
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:57,538
have there it's more your you are

695
00:29:54,298 --> 00:30:00,119
considering what

696
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:01,740
flavor experience you want to have and

697
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:04,259
and that might include this craft beer

698
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,179
of nine percent or you pick a white wine

699
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:09,119
versus a red wine

700
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:11,940
um and their people people go and and

701
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:16,379
consider flavors and actually wine might

702
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,419
be a better example than beer because

703
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,039
a Budweiser is a Budweiser it like

704
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:23,640
tastes the same everywhere it's always

705
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:25,700
the same but in in wines we already know

706
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,960
that different years have different

707
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,840
different years from the same wine

708
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,058
producer have different flavors and and

709
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,099
they are priced years and and not not

710
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:39,480
surprised years

711
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:43,918
and the the the variety and variability

712
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,000
of of flavor experience is priced into a

713
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,538
wine

714
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,640
and people seek that out

715
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,679
and that's what cannabis is we the

716
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,299
Cannabis industry has an impossible task

717
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,519
on trying to make a consistent product

718
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:59,519
that tastes the same every time right

719
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:03,778
and has the same THC content every time

720
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:07,019
so why not give up on it and think about

721
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:10,440
it more from the craft or Craft brewery

722
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:11,759
or the um the wynyard approach

723
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,620
yeah

724
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,599
no I mean it's something that's come up

725
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:18,658
time and time again on this podcast was

726
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,099
the whole is the whole idea of

727
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:24,299
the

728
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:26,398
laser focus on THC percentage is you

729
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:28,679
know doing a disservice to the industry

730
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,379
just for the reasons that you said that

731
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,080
you know people aren't concentrating on

732
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,940
the flavors the Aromas

733
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,220
um or even just you know how clean the

734
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,440
smoke is how you know Pleasant it is on

735
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,740
the pole or anything like that it's just

736
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,200
THC percentage and you know perhaps

737
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,440
having a standard unit like you've

738
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,298
outlined is a way to sort of level the

739
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,740
playing field

740
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:55,398
right

741
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,399
and the regulator

742
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,100
on the edible side

743
00:31:56,898 --> 00:32:01,439
prior to regulations there were

744
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:04,259
chocolates with like 420 milligrams of

745
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,298
THC or or the thousand milligram THC

746
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:08,579
chocolate bar like the this like oh we

747
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:09,778
we put a gram of pure THC into the

748
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:12,778
chocolate

749
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:14,519
these were these things existed

750
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:16,380
and then the regulator came and said

751
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,019
like no

752
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,020
do it in a in a package size and and

753
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:23,639
then the industry can adapt I I find it

754
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,500
annoying when people say oh don't do

755
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,960
regulations

756
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,480
um people are like Industries or

757
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,679
products adapt to pressures and uh it

758
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,440
might even

759
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,700
make for a better product

760
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,919
yeah so I I could assume we are early

761
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,220
enough in this industry

762
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:46,620
in this legal industry and in the US

763
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,798
it's still not legal

764
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:51,479
uh in Canada it is uh and in Germany

765
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:53,519
medical is but they're thinking about

766
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,038
regulation so I think we're really early

767
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,079
enough to maybe do a concerted effort by

768
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:02,220
the industry

769
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:04,678
or n and or the regulator

770
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,058
to say

771
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,380
package size

772
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:09,898
hmm

773
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,240
THC is package size not THC percentage

774
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:13,979
but THC package size

775
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,359
yeah

776
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,919
and and you have to have different

777
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,139
package sizes for different different

778
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,600
product classes you can't you can't say

779
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,580
that the same amount of THC should be in

780
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:28,038
a joint than in a vape card

781
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:28,038
we are going to run into issues there

782
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,880
and

783
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,798
uh and then this would allow us to think

784
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,399
about all the other

785
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,259
benefits or so that that cannabis has to

786
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,058
offer to the consumer

787
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:43,919
yeah no and I think you're right I think

788
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:45,298
you know edibles

789
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,679
you know like you said that has been

790
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:48,058
regulated to be kind of more of a

791
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,159
standard size and I think you know

792
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:52,019
tinchers the way that that's measured or

793
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,760
the way that that's labeled that makes a

794
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:58,019
lot more sense too right it's the amount

795
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:59,898
of milligrams that are in this volume

796
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:02,579
um makes a lot makes a lot more sense

797
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:04,319
and we we saw a standardization there

798
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:06,538
that right it's like normally like what

799
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,219
is it 40 milligrams per milliliters or

800
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:10,320
so and you have like 100 milliliter per

801
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,898
bottle or so right it just

802
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,820
someone has standardized itself and and

803
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:16,739
that is because you you can measure the

804
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,359
THC before you formulate it into the

805
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,279
product right into the chocolate into

806
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:22,199
the oil right you can measure that

807
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,419
um so in in cannabis flower where you

808
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,598
can't control it as well you just have

809
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:29,878
to get away from the weight and just say

810
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,980
well we just the weight of the biomass

811
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:35,098
and just like two different ways go away

812
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,139
from the ounce and the the eighth and

813
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,359
the gram and just say package size of

814
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,099
that many milligrams of TLC and like

815
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,719
like we had talked about earlier so much

816
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:44,820
of

817
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,219
what is eventually going to get into

818
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,500
your body is going to be dependent on

819
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,939
what method that you use to ingest it

820
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,579
right right whether it's a joint versus

821
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,320
uh anything else yes and and you are

822
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:57,598
absolutely right and that is actually

823
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,539
the the alternative

824
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,820
um way of labeling that I that I propose

825
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,279
so there's the alcohol side right

826
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,519
package size that many milligrams of THC

827
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,579
per per package like a standard drink

828
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:12,838
like a standard unit

829
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:16,200
um

830
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,699
but it doesn't speak to how much THC you

831
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,799
actually get into your system or how

832
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,118
intoxicating that is we know that that

833
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,099
uh

834
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,800
Edibles hit you harder than flour

835
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:28,140
because the THC is digested first in the

836
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,820
liver and it forms the 11 hydroxy THC

837
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:32,219
which is more intoxicating so you get a

838
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,359
bigger Buzz

839
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:35,879
um

840
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,619
and we talked about that joints

841
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,900
depending on the architecture deliver

842
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:42,300
different amounts of THC to the body so

843
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,000
therefore even the same same flower

844
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,339
depending on how you make it would

845
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,739
deliver different amounts of THC so if

846
00:35:47,338 --> 00:35:51,000
you go by package size you would have

847
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:53,098
the same package size but different

848
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,920
effects right

849
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,599
so therefore

850
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,358
I thought of an alternative but a little

851
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,220
but more complicated way to presenting

852
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,739
so not the presentation is not more

853
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:07,980
complicated but the

854
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:08,759
finding that number is more complicated

855
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,500
um

856
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,619
did you take your multivitamins this

857
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,619
morning

858
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,599
um not a multivitamin but I do take

859
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:21,598
vitamin D okay so uh how many how much

860
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:25,920
vitamin D did you take this morning

861
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,559
um I believe it's 1 000 IU

862
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,380
right you took a thousand uh

863
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,719
international units of vitamin D so how

864
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,220
much milligram was that

865
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:37,858
I don't know

866
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:40,919
you don't care that's okay because the

867
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:44,039
international units are built to give

868
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,539
the same effect independent of the

869
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:47,519
formulation

870
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:50,699
to the user

871
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:53,519
and it's a it's an arbitrary measure

872
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:55,739
that is not translatable from vitamin D

873
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:59,880
that you talk to vitamin C that others

874
00:36:55,739 --> 00:37:03,000
might take or Vitamin B or whatever

875
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,220
other multivitamins they take so the

876
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,739
international unit doesn't care about

877
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:11,299
the amount you consume it cares about

878
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:11,299
the biological effect

879
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,639
and so you see where I'm going with this

880
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,039
mm-hmm

881
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,379
so

882
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:22,079
how about

883
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:27,059
we do a really really complicated long

884
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:30,060
and expensive study on figuring out how

885
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:32,358
different cannabis products and

886
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:34,799
formulations and consumption methods

887
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:37,739
affect the body

888
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,500
and deliver the same and then try to

889
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:42,659
find the the right amounts per

890
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,239
formulation to deliver the same amount

891
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:48,899
of THC to the brain to get the same

892
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:51,000
intoxication or yeah to deliver DHC to

893
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,960
get the same intoxicate so you see it's

894
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,699
way more difficult to yeah to do but

895
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,039
they have done it for vitamin d and

896
00:37:56,699 --> 00:38:01,439
vitamin C and so on so it like it can be

897
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,599
done but I'm not a biologist or medic uh

898
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,159
a doctor so I actually don't really

899
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,338
understand how they do it I just know

900
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:11,399
that it's being done

901
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:14,039
as if we sorry but there are a lot more

902
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,358
variables in cannabis right because of

903
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,219
the different cultivars the different

904
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,019
modes of administration and all that

905
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:21,659
sort of thing yes and so that's why I

906
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:25,019
had to offer two ideas because you can

907
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:28,259
shut down an idea early or I invite

908
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:31,380
experts in that field to come in help

909
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,880
with comments so I might just have

910
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,680
pushed

911
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,280
the stone I hope that others help

912
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:41,219
rolling it along excellent so

913
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,320
um if you then say now you if you have

914
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:46,199
to figure that out you could now say now

915
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,780
we sell cannabis as

916
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:51,838
thousand IUS

917
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:55,140
and then you can say the chocolate is a

918
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:57,119
thousand I one piece of chocolate is a

919
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:59,879
thousand IUS

920
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,380
one dropper of that tincture is a

921
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,099
thousand IUS

922
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,660
and this one joint is

923
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,338
a thousand IUS

924
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:10,500
at that point

925
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:12,480
and from that we know that it's

926
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:16,380
different milligrams for the texture for

927
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,300
the flower and for the chocolate

928
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,519
but the end consumer doesn't need to

929
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,320
understand now milligrams milligrams per

930
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,639
milliliter and percent weight

931
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,920
percentages

932
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:28,019
the consumer only needs to remember one

933
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,700
thing I use or standard unit or whatever

934
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:35,880
you want to call it

935
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:39,239
I wanted to call it standard Buzz uh but

936
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,039
or unit of buzz but I I leave that again

937
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:43,078
to other people

938
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,719
and so the end consumer only has to

939
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,740
remember that there is one kind of

940
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:52,379
measurement or or numbering

941
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:55,500
and that that user

942
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,519
if they are new they are advised to take

943
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,358
a thousand

944
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:02,338
yeah uh and if they see that was a bit

945
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,059
much then they might realize after the

946
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:07,259
second or third time like 500 is there

947
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:10,619
preferred number

948
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,240
and for uh experienced user they might

949
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,400
go to five thousand

950
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,759
units

951
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,420
[Music]

952
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:22,500
but they then can switch from a join to

953
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,358
a to a cookie or to a gummy

954
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,760
and know that they get the same Buzz

955
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:30,199
they don't have to retry trade every

956
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,200
single time right

957
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,700
and it's in the nutraceutical Realms

958
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,039
that I use so this standard unit of

959
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:43,259
effect in cannabis would also be in this

960
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:45,838
semi-medical effect and that uh arounds

961
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,520
and that's what what medical amariana

962
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:50,699
was the trail barriers are for the

963
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:53,460
legalization the medical effects and it

964
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:54,799
would help with a self titration of the

965
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,338
product

966
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,800
excellent

967
00:40:56,338 --> 00:41:01,078
all right Marcus I know I'm already over

968
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,240
the time that I I promised I would keep

969
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,560
you it's a fascinating topic and I think

970
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:07,259
it's going to generate a lot of good

971
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:10,380
discussion at can Med yeah I hope so too

972
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,060
but before I let you go

973
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,740
um I'm already going to provide links to

974
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:15,719
the articles that I know that you've

975
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:17,459
written on the topic

976
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,459
um in the show notes but if there are

977
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,920
any other resources that you would like

978
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,858
to share or that people can read up more

979
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,619
kind of on this issue please please let

980
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:30,539
us know right now and then of course any

981
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:33,660

we do we publish on our website and that

990
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,780
