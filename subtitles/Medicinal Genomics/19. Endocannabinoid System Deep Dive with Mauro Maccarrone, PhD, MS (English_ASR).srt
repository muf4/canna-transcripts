at the annual canmed conference

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,560
so we decided to keep the conversations

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,359
flowing online

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,799

and join our guest this episode

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,080
is dr maro macaron maro

59
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:21,280
is a pioneer in endocannabinoid research

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,000
in 1997 his team identified the receptor

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
targets

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,318
for the first two endocannabinoids that

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,360
were discovered by professor raphael

64
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,759
matchulum

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,920
earlier in the decade anandamide and 2ag

66
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,039
since then the endocannabinoid system

67
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,559
has been the focus

68
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,759
of his research at kmed 2021

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,479
maro will present the complex

70
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,079
endocannabinoid system

71
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,639
and the challenge of developing

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,760
selective drugs towards its distinct

73
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,839
elements dr michael macaron's

74
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,359
understanding of the endocannabinoid

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,360
system is exceptional

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
and i really enjoyed picking his brain

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
on some of the topics that have come up

78
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
in conversations with other podcast

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,120
guests

80
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,439
we discuss the technical challenges that

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,039
prevented researchers from understanding

82
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,318
the endocannabinoid system

83
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,239
until the early 90s how the discovery of

84
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,799
the endocannabinoid system changed

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,959
medical research and drug development

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,959
the difference between endocannabinoids

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,680
and phytocannabinoids

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,640
the large number of enzymes involved in

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,200
synthesizing

90
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,839
and cleaving each endocannabinoid and

91
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,000
how blocking or enhancing those enzymes

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,360
can affect the concentration

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,360
of endocannabinoids in a person's body

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,920
how when do cannabinoids work together

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
to create an entourage effect

96
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,199
how an increased level of

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,080
endocannabinoids can help you forget

98
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,000
a painful experience like childbirth or

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,000
a difficult run

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,959
and why researchers need to agree on a

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,400
standardized formulation of cannabinoids

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,360
to use for research before we get to

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,920
that conversation

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,080
i'd like to thank this episode's sponsor

absolutely and we're very excited to

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,199
have you as a presenter at canmed2021

146
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,639
i'm really interested to see what you

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,720
have to present on

148
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,400
and for people who maybe aren't familiar

149
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,319
with you or familiar with your work

150
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,000
i was hoping we could start if you would

151
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
give sort of a brief bio

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,079
of who you are and the research that

153
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,000
you've done into the endocannabinoid

154
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:26,639
system yeah well i'm a biochemist

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,918
and i work as a full professor at

156
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,720
university of

157
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,959
rome and recently i moved to university

158
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
of

159
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:37,439
la cula that is nearby i was

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,038
involved for almost three decades

161
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:44,240
in lipid signaling so how

162
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,519
certain fat molecules fatty molecules

163
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,720
can bring

164
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:51,918
information in our body and i

165
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,599
was there when endocannabinoids

166
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,439
were discovered and since then i made of

167
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,399
that a major

168
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,879
subject of my research activity so my

169
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,679
group

170
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,038
works actively on the endogenous

171
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,038
components that we call

172
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,038
endocannabinoids

173
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,519
so that's fascinating so you were

174
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,319
actually there when the endocannabinoid

175
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,959
system was first discovered uh

176
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,360
yeah you know we issued our first paper

177
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,318
in

178
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,919
1997 and you know that the first

179
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:28,639
endocannabinoid anandamite was

180
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:32,799
discovered by rafael meshulam

181
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,840
group um shulam's group in 1992

182
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,240
and then the second major

183
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:41,519
endocannabinoid to arachidonil glycerol

184
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,038
was discovered in 1995

185
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:49,279
again by mishulam and independently

186
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:52,399
sugura so two years after the discovery

187
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:55,839
of these compounds we were able to

188
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:59,839
show some properties of the

189
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,839
receptor targets

190
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,759
and so i know we're going to get pretty

191
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,919
deep

192
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,598
into the endocannabinoid system and all

193
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,719
the different body systems and organs

194
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,639
that it touches but

195
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,639
maybe it'd be good to start for again

196
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,280
people who maybe aren't as familiar

197
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
if you could kind of give a broad broad

198
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,239
brush summary

199
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
of what is the endocannabinoid system

200
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,960
and what function does it serve in the

201
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,318
body

202
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:27,758
well you know uh this is a this

203
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,039
is a system because it is composed of

204
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,879
many molecules some uh

205
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:38,399
are able to activate targets

206
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:41,240
and these are called agonists

207
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,719
of receptors and are the true

208
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,080
endocannabinoids

209
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,519
and endocannabinoids come from fatty

210
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,720
acids that we

211
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,639
eat and we know for a long time

212
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,639
like arachidonic acid and then

213
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,759
we have all the targets of these

214
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,120
endocannabinoids

215
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,639
again receptors on the surface of our

216
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,560
cells

217
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:10,000
enzymes little machines that break down

218
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:13,278
or synthesize the endocannabinoids

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,399
other proteins on the membranes that can

220
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,838
transport endocannabinoids in and out

221
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,159
the cells

222
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:26,080
and therefore it is quite an ensemble of

223
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:28,879
molecules we should say

224
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,839
basically distributed everywhere in our

225
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,958
body

226
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:38,320
you can find them in virtually in all

227
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:38,319
tissues where they play different roles

228
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
so given that the endocannabinoid system

229
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,639
seems to be

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,200
so ubiquitous as you mentioned it's

231
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,000
pretty much

232
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,440
present in almost all the body tissues

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,799
and all the body organs

234
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,880
why do you think it took so long for

235
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,879
researchers to really discover

236
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,799
the endocannabinoid system in the role

237
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,039
that it plays in the body

238
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,319
uh this is a this is a really a good

239
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,240
question ben but

240
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,640
you know lipids and endocannabinoids

241
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,919
again

242
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,958
are lipids are fatty molecules

243
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,759
are quite difficult to handle and

244
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,479
the research on these molecules is never

245
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,838
easy

246
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,959
uh is it is not yet possible to

247
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,519
buy something from a company that all at

248
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,719
once

249
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,278
allow you allows you to measure uh

250
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
the amount of these components and to

251
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,559
understand

252
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,439
if they are present and if they are what

253
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,199
they do

254
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,440
so it is maybe a real is a purely

255
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,079
technical question or scientific

256
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,760
problem if you want that lipids are

257
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,958
difficult to handle

258
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,559
and it was then after many years of

259
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,199
research on proteins

260
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,199
and then on nucleic acids the

261
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,278
information material of ours

262
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,360
of our cells that we were able to look

263
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:04,399
more carefully into lipidic substances

264
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,800
and therefore in the 80s

265
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,240
for arachidonic acid derivatives and

266
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:13,679
then in the 90s for endocannabinoids

267
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,039
research focused on these molecules and

268
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,679
was able to make a kind of quantum leap

269
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,679
since then

270
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,879
interesting interesting and now since

271
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,799
the discovery of this system

272
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,320
and as we mentioned it is involved in so

273
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,639
many different

274
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
organs and tissues how has that

275
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,000
knowledge

276
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,519
sort of changed how you know medical

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,240
research is done

278
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,759
into different disorders that may affect

279
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,240
these systems

280
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,399
uh well it is true that the discovery of

281
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,959
endocannabinoids

282
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,559
immediately attracted also

283
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,589
pharmaceutical companies

284
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,879
because the uh

285
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,160
[Music]

286
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,399
endocannabinoids themselves and the

287
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,919
targets that they

288
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,958
hit in the cells can

289
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,240
represent novel targets for novel

290
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,439
therapeutics

291
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,879
in a time where we did not have

292
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,639
so many new totally innovative targets

293
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,399
to look at

294
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:21,278
therefore in a few years basically uh

295
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:24,320
one and a half decade we could say

296
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:27,439
enzymes that break down endocannabinoids

297
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,040
became targets for intense

298
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,440
research efforts by

299
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,559
all major pharmaceutical companies all

300
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,839
over the world

301
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,278
and so were the receptors so in a way

302
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,040
these compounds have

303
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:46,639
filled the gap and in this

304
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:50,159
in this gap therapeutic perspectives

305
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,159
seem to be very very strong

306
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:56,240
great and as i was doing the research

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,440
for this conversation i did come across

308
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,680
your paper entitled endocannabinoid

309
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,279
signaling at the periphery 50 years

310
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,039
after thc

311
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,399
um it's quite extensive look at the

312
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,879
endocannabinoid system

313
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,799
and as i've mentioned several times all

314
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,799
the different organs and body systems

315
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,359
that it interacts with

316
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,639
um and i will put a link to that paper

317
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,320
in the show notes

318
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,680
in the description so everyone can take

319
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,040
a look at that and very much encourage

320
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,078
people to read it

321
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,958
um and a lot of heavy hitters in in the

322
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,120
co-authors

323
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,319
of that paper including our dear friend

324
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,480
here at kamet dr

325
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,160
raphael machulam i was hoping we could

326
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,200
kind of use maybe that

327
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,000
paper as a framework to explore the

328
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,639
endocannabinoid system a bit more so

329
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,320
maybe let's let's start with covering

330
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,000
some of the different systems that the

331
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,120
endocannabinoid system

332
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,679
interacts with in that really show that

333
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,399
promise

334
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,439
for therapeutics that you mentioned yeah

335
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,839
but first

336
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,399
well thanks for the quotation and i like

337
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,800
to say that that was a

338
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,120
community paper that i happened to put

339
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,359
together and coordinate

340
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,879
the colleagues that have contributed the

341
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,919
most to the field

342
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,919
in the la since the discovery of

343
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,240
thc tetra hydro delta nine

344
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,559
tetrahydrocannabinol

345
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
and this gives me the chance to make a

346
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:20,559
clear point

347
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,919
plant extracts so the phytocannabinoids

348
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,518
like thc

349
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:28,639
were discovered approximately 30 years

350
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,360
before the endogenous cannabinoids

351
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,000
so we have to clearly make a distinction

352
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,720
between

353
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,039
the endogenous compounds that all of us

354
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,879
we

355
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:43,439
do have and the those compounds that

356
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,439
some of us decide to take

357
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,399
in different ways by the plants

358
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,838
and these are very different so

359
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:55,759
cannabinoids were discovered uh

360
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,880
almo now uh more than 50 years ago in 64

361
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,600
again by rafael michelan and only

362
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,679
after that will we understood that there

363
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,120
are endogenous compounds

364
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:11,439
that are activate the targets

365
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,120
accidentally activated also by the plant

366
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,320
extract

367
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,519
and therefore cannabinoids

368
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,519
are something different from the

369
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:23,000
endocannabinoids

370
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,120
the endocannabinoids in the

371
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,720
endocannabinoid system

372
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,600
certainly uh holds a lot of hold a lot

373
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,320
of promise

374
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
for uh central the central nervous

375
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,440
system

376
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,639
where it can control can contribute to

377
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,240
mood there are um

378
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,120
some indications whereby depression

379
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,839
can take advantage of an inhibition of

380
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,480
the

381
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,680
cleavage of the endogenous cannabinoids

382
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,440
for instance

383
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,239
but also at the periphery bone

384
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,440
homeostasis

385
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:04,000
rather than reproductive functions

386
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:07,120
rather than energy homeostasis

387
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,159
which means food intake the pleasure of

388
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,000
eating food

389
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:15,600
the uh the search for

390
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,639
palatable food and the way

391
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,278
we take energy out of food

392
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,440
making more fats like

393
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:28,879
lipogenesis or breaking fats

394
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,759
in the lipolysis all these aspects

395
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,240
are in a way or another under control

396
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,240
over the

397
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,240
endocannabinoids

398
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,439
so that's interesting when you're sort

399
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,720
of making that distinction between the

400
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,759
endocannabinoids and the

401
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,399
phytocannabinoids and

402
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,440
i think at least i understand that you

403
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,879
know

404
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,399
folks who benefit from cannabinoid

405
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,360
therapies

406
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,360
typically may have

407
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,959
a deficiency in their endocannabinoids

408
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,000
that the body is

409
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,518
is creating endogenously and

410
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,679
from what i understand in talking with

411
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,640
you that the endocannabinoid system is a

412
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,559
very

413
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,400
complex system with a lot of different

414
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,038
things at play so

415
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,759
how many different ways could someone

416
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,838
develop

417
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,038
a deficiency in their endogenous

418
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:21,279
cannabinoids

419
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,480
or there are actually many which makes

420
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,558
the the field

421
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,519
complex but also challenging and

422
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,798
promising

423
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:32,119
uh just to give you a general guideline

424
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:35,839
each endocannabinoid is synthesis

425
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:40,079
biosynthesized by one or more enzymes

426
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:44,480
and then it is cleaved by one or more

427
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:48,798
additional enzymes if you are able to

428
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,440
block or enhance any of these enzymes

429
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,519
you can modify the final content of

430
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
endocannabinoids what is called in

431
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,079
general

432
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:02,159
the endocannabinoid tone and this

433
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:04,439
in our body apparently the way we

434
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,600
use we take advantage of

435
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,549
endocannabinoids

436
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,519
as a very

437
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:12,558
[Music]

438
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,639
special signals is

439
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,038
through metabolism so there is a

440
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,640
metabolic control

441
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:23,359
in other words the way our body decides

442
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,440
how much endocannabinoid must be in a

443
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,399
certain cell at a certain

444
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,038
point can make a really difference

445
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,559
between

446
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,558
health and disease

447
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,440
so you mentioned that there are a lot of

448
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,079
different endocannabinoids

449
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,880
roughly how many different

450
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,639
endocannabinoids

451
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,640
do we know of and are there more

452
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,599
uh so far we can say that we know uh a

453
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,200
dozen

454
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:57,759
of which again still the very first two

455
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,080
to be discovered anandamide and 2ag

456
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:04,160
those that i mentioned before were found

457
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:07,759
already in 1992 and 1995

458
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,679
those two remain uh the most interesting

459
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,720
because apparently they hold

460
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,640
they they are uh the

461
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:21,759
the main signals that our cells uh use

462
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:25,840
yet we have to admit that of the quite

463
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:28,879
many others we don't know yet much

464
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:32,798
so maybe we have not learned enough

465
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,559
about anandamide in 2eg that we decided

466
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,440
to investigate

467
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,000
thoroughly the others and therefore we

468
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,679
cannot

469
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,919
really predict if another of these

470
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,200
endocannabinoids

471
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,280
can can be more relevant for a certain

472
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,880
specific condition

473
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:54,720
maybe a specific disease one of the

474
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,799
the topics that always comes up in

475
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,480
talking about

476
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,400
cannabis medicine is this whole idea of

477
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,480
the entourage effect

478
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,798
and i'm curious to get your thoughts on

479
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,400
that um from an endocannabinoid

480
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:07,759
perspective and you know we were just

481
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
talking about there are

482
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,960
many different endocannabinoids so is

483
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,960
there sort of an

484
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,240
entourage effect that's happening

485
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,079
endogenously as well

486
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,400
this is also very interesting question

487
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:24,480
then because we have learned

488
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:28,080
and it is clear that there are compounds

489
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,319
that do not act directly on the receptor

490
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,399
targets of the endocannabinoids

491
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,960
but can potentiate the activity of other

492
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,640
endocannabinoids on that

493
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,120
on those receptors why because they

494
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,400
interfere with the metabolism of those

495
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,158
endocannabinoids

496
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,759
for instance by blocking the

497
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,400
hydrolytic enzymes and this entourage

498
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,038
effect

499
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,559
seems to be relevant under many many

500
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,599
circumstances

501
00:20:54,558 --> 00:21:00,558
and again also the endogenous compounds

502
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,279
not to mention the plant extracts that

503
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,240
we might

504
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,759
ingest for whatever reason also the

505
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,919
endogenous compounds

506
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,919
can play this entourage effect

507
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,679
and you mentioned earlier when we were

508
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,519
talking about how

509
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,640
it took so long for researchers to

510
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,319
really fully understand the

511
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,038
endocannabinoid system you mentioned

512
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,879
that

513
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,480
it's hard to test someone for the levels

514
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
of endocannabinoids that are in their

515
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,480
system or at least it was

516
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,519
earlier is there a better system for

517
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,000
doing that now

518
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,240
can someone you know go and get tested

519
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,240
and get lab results in terms of

520
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,839
figuring out if they have an

521
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,839
endocannabinoid deficiency

522
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:44,639
[Music]

523
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:47,918
basically the techniques remain uh

524
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,400
sort of highly specialized you have to

525
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,360
use

526
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
what is called liquid chromatography

527
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,678
mass

528
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,678
spectrometry maybe

529
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,960
it is true that now you can find these

530
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,480
techniques

531
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,360
much easier than it was just few years

532
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,839
ago

533
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,959
however you need a high level of

534
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,000
specialization

535
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,960
and high level of expertise to do these

536
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,558
essays

537
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,600
it is not like for others substances in

538
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,319
our blood

539
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,038
that with the drop of blood in 20

540
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,879
minutes

541
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:27,079
you have your uh your data

542
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,799
it is still quite challenging there are

543
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:34,079
investigations looking for alternatives

544
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:37,359
and this might change

545
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,480
the scenario in the coming years but so

546
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,359
far

547
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,480
you still need high and high level of

548
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,519
specialization

549
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,640
and quite sophisticated machinery

550
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,639
to do these essays

551
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:55,519
and i would imagine too would the level

552
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,640
of endocannabinoids in a person's system

553
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,240
sort of depend

554
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,640
on different stresses or as you said you

555
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,519
know

556
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,720
it can be part of metabolism so could do

557
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,798
the levels sort of

558
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:12,319
fluctuate throughout the day

559
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,960
this is this cannot be really said

560
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,079
uh conclusively from a scientific point

561
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,519
of view because

562
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:23,678
to my knowledge it has never been tested

563
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:25,839
in a very solid scientific manner

564
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,360
but what we know is that there are

565
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,558
changes there are

566
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:33,199
during the day rather than during

567
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,000
different conditions for instance the

568
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,759
estrous

569
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,880
cycle in women and certainly there are

570
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,879
changes from

571
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,440
individual to individuals so

572
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,720
interpersonal changes

573
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,759
we cannot yet assign a certain

574
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,960
a meaning to a certain value we are not

575
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,319
at the stage of

576
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,840
defining threshold values uh

577
00:23:54,319 --> 00:24:00,720
below which everything is okay for the

578
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,359
world population and above which there

579
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,640
might be

580
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:07,839
a problem uh you we are we are

581
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,120
let's say starting to learn how

582
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:14,079
these differences could be meaningful

583
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,079
for our health

584
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,399
yeah that's interesting and i mean i

585
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,080
personally

586
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,440
i'm a runner so i am familiar that

587
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,199
as i believe and you can you can

588
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,640
certainly correct me if i'm wrong that

589
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,720
anandamide

590
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,400
is sort of what's credited with the

591
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,360
runner's high do i have that correct uh

592
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,759
yeah but it depends on the way you uh

593
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,879
what you mean with high

594
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,278
what i can tell you is that there could

595
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,320
be an

596
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:47,599
increase in anandamide but

597
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:50,798
maybe to cope with the pain

598
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,480
that can be associated with an extensive

599
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:55,839
physical exercise

600
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:00,000
because endocannabinoids like anandamide

601
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:04,158
are certainly the analgesic

602
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,278
so there is a the hypothesis that

603
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,760
when you practice a lot but also in

604
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:13,119
other circumstances like

605
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:16,079
in the delivery phase

606
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,918
when you you are delivering a baby an

607
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:22,399
increase of endocannabinoids

608
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,400
help you to cope with the pain

609
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,839
there is also something extra and

610
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,038
something more that seems very

611
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,158
interesting and the fact that an

612
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,960
increased

613
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,480
level of endocannabinoids might help you

614
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,519
to forget

615
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,599
abusive memories uh so

616
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,119
to forget something that you don't did

617
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,558
not really like

618
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:47,038
but that in terms of evolution uh

619
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,240
must be done again for instance once

620
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,440
more once again

621
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:55,038
in a partition so the

622
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:58,400
the pain that the the mother

623
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:01,599
can feel in the in delivery is uh

624
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:05,759
forgotten better with an increase or

625
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:09,519
with an increase of anandamide so

626
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,720
is not that you feel better as if you

627
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,918
were smoking

628
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,000
a joke but you might feel

629
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,970
less pain and forget something which is

630
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
negative

631
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,839
[Music]

632
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,079
due to this increased level of

633
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,759
endocannabinoids

634
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,558
so that's interesting so you're telling

635
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,400
me that my body is helping me forget the

636
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,000
pain from that run so that i'll

637
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,240
i'll get up and do it all over again the

638
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
next day exactly

639
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,599
and you like to do it again and you

640
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,798
don't associate

641
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,359
the negative memory or the pain feeling

642
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,158
uh that you had that is certainly a

643
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,439
clever trick

644
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,880
because uh oh yeah i do get out there

645
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,960
and do it again

646
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,919
um i did want to talk to you a bit more

647
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,919
about um

648
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,240
you know cannabis therapeutics or maybe

649
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,080
just you know phytocannabinoids in

650
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,200
so yeah one of the the newer aspects

651
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,240
that we've been seeing

652
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,480
research on in at canmed

653
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,400
is looking into sort of these different

654
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,759
types of cannabinoids whether it be

655
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,880
in acid form or even in cannabinoid

656
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,558
varins

657
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,399
so i was wondering if you could speak a

658
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:22,000
bit to sort of how these

659
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:24,319
different forms of the cannabinoids

660
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,640
how does their effect differ on on the

661
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,678
body

662
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,520
well as for the acids

663
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,640
you know that we also have

664
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:38,879
endocannabinoids that are

665
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,480
acidic like an arachidonyl glycine it is

666
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,799
a natural substance

667
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:48,480
an endogenous substance with an

668
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,679
acid tail so it is an endocannabinoid

669
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,919
acid actually

670
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,880
and we know that it mimics some of the

671
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,759
properties of an

672
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,200
andamide uh for instance with the law of

673
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,558
with affinity for

674
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:05,038
type 1 cannabinoid receptors uh

675
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:05,440
with in anti-inflammatory activity and

676
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,200
again

677
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,960
analgesic properties the same can be

678
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,558
uh said for the main

679
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,600
cannabinoid acid that is a

680
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:20,798
phytocannabinoid this time

681
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:24,240
a derivative of thc er

682
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:27,359
in 11 or oe case it but besides

683
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:31,038
the chemistry behind is a an acid form

684
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:34,479
of thc but this one is a form

685
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:36,720
of excretion is a metabolite that has to

686
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,720
be

687
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:44,760
wasted by the body so

688
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:47,919
if you add acidic tails to endogenous or

689
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,980
plant-derived cannabinoids you certainly

690
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,960
have different effects

691
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,919
[Music]

692
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,720
maybe what is more complex is to

693
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,799
understand

694
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:04,960
how these molecules along with the

695
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:11,359
variants like for instance

696
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:14,399
the the thcb the tetrahydrocannabine

697
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:17,599
they play together with the others

698
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:19,599
components of the plant extracts or the

699
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:23,839
endocannabinoid system

700
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:26,798
and this complexity of molecules

701
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:29,599
working together is a real challenge to

702
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:34,398
be understood

703
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:37,759
adding thc having a cbd cannabidiol

704
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:41,599
having both together or adding them

705
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:44,720
along with other less investigated

706
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,439
compounds can make really a huge

707
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,600
difference

708
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,840
in the biological activity that they

709
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,839
have

710
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,558
that's got to be the biggest challenge

711
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,918
of all is that there seems to be so many

712
00:29:54,558 --> 00:30:00,158
different compounds

713
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:03,600
at play here and and it seems to be very

714
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,600
individualistic too in terms of what's

715
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,359
what the need is in the individual body

716
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,359
so i imagine that must be a

717
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:13,519
very big challenge for anyone who's

718
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,519
trying to develop a therapeutic

719
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:20,158
yeah and you know what i like to

720
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,879
to say as much as i can is that it is a

721
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,480
pity

722
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:28,159
that we did not yet uh decide

723
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,440
which are the standardized formulations

724
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,000
to be tested also in therapeutic terms

725
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,038
because because if we keep on using

726
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,599
different formulations of which

727
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,480
maybe you only know the amount of thc

728
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,480
and cbd

729
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,038
but you do not really i i don't want to

730
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,519
to see my i'm polite but you don't seem

731
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,558
to

732
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,519
to care at all about the others you

733
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,798
actually miss

734
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,759
the opportunity of learning from what

735
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,879
you are doing

736
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,679
because using different things will not

737
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,720
give you

738
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,519
a solid knowledge

739
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,278
that will finally help you to advance

740
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,240
your understanding

741
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,640
we have to clearly say that cannabis is

742
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,880
not

743
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:18,960
one you can have as many cannabis

744
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:23,440
as many formulations are going around

745
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:27,759
are being used or can be used

746
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,640
so the composition of each formulation

747
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:33,119
and also the amount of the different

748
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,360
components of each formulation

749
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,479
can make really a difference and we

750
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,519
should now

751
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,798
decide how to standardize

752
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:46,720
these things with the hope of learning

753
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:49,759
maybe from mistakes but in a 5-year time

754
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,558
10-year time we will really know better

755
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,798
what is good what is less good for our

756
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,038
our health

757
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,798
that's a really interesting point and it

758
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,000
it really touches on

759
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:01,839
you know a lot of the different

760
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,440
conversations i've had on the podcast

761
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,038
and in presentations that we've had in

762
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,159
previous canmeds

763
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:09,038
is first of all from a testing

764
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,480
perspective

765
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:14,000
it's difficult for them to have assays

766
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,599
that are going to detect all the

767
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,759
different cannabinoids or

768
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,918
and we haven't even gotten into terpenes

769
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,519
and flavonoids and stillborn

770
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,759
i am interested to get your thoughts on

771
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,919
that but from a testing perspective it's

772
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,798
hard for them to really get a full

773
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,799
profile of what the product is from a

774
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,879
cultivation side it's very hard for them

775
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:34,158
to produce a consistent product

776
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,480
and then it's interesting to hear you

777
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,320
say from a research perspective that

778
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,200
it's difficult for you to have a real

779
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:43,038
standard medicine to work off of so

780
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,278
it seems to be a problem that really

781
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:48,319
touches all the different aspects

782
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:51,038
of the industry yeah

783
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,918
and is a problem that finally has to be

784
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,558
faced

785
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,559
and i'm perfectly aware that it is not a

786
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,440
trivial problem if you

787
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,398
consider that we know that from a

788
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,600
cannabis

789
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,479
extract from cannabis sativa or cannabis

790
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,000
indica

791
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,599
both used to make

792
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,960
formulations used in therapy

793
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:18,079
you can expect at least 110

794
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,798
different phytocannabinoids and

795
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:24,000
on top of them at least 440

796
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:26,000
non-cannabinoid components like

797
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,359
terpenoids flavonoids

798
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and and so many others so it is a

799
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,278
challenge

800
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,839
but it is just because

801
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:40,398
this challenge can lead to real good

802
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:44,480
drugs therapeutic drugs that we have

803
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:47,759
to take it in the proper way

804
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,798
there are no shortcuts to reach in an

805
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,119
easy way

806
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:56,639
a good drug at the end you have to

807
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:59,839
study properly the the composition

808
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,038
and the effects of

809
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,798
these combinations and maybe if we did

810
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,839
that 20 years ago

811
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:10,639
now we would really know so much

812
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,799
more then we could have more

813
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,440
therapeutics

814
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,000
that are active effective and are based

815
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,358
on these

816
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,039
cannabinoids yeah it certainly would

817
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,679
have been nice to get a jump start 20

818
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,199
years ago

819
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,159
but i i know at least here in the united

820
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,559
states that

821
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,000
that was not possible given the the laws

822
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,000
but thankfully

823
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,320
those seem to be loosening and research

824
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,559
has really come a long way so we're

825
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,559
excited in a lot of different ways

826
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,639
and if i may add ben another clear

827
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,319
distinction that we should make

828
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:51,358
is between recreational cannabis

829
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:55,519
and medicinal cannabis because

830
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:57,440
a therapeutic use of cannabis under the

831
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,800
responsibility and the control of a

832
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,159
physician that

833
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,440
continuously looks uh a

834
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:08,319
desire he looks after his patient is

835
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,599
something and to my understanding that

836
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,720
could be

837
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,760
made as free as possible

838
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,279
on the other hand a recreational use of

839
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,560
cannabis can be

840
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,000
uh dangerous it's not not at all true

841
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,759
that these compounds

842
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,119
are harmless especially if you think of

843
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,640
the what is going on is available also

844
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,480
through

845
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:38,319
internet and other means to young people

846
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,838
you can really find formulations where

847
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,119
thc itself is 10 more 10 times

848
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:47,358
more concentrated than in others and

849
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,680
other formulations where you also have

850
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:54,319
unexpected compounds so

851
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:58,159
a a free recreational cannabis can be

852
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:01,119
more dangerous than usual and certainly

853
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,920
it i have the feeling that certainly

854
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,119
these

855
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,320
mixing up the two recreational and the

856
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,280
therapeutic

857
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:14,079
did not help the the medicinal cannabis

858
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,680
yeah i think i think you're right um at

859
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,280
least for a long time here in the united

860
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,000
states and actually it is still the case

861
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,400
today

862
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,920
it's been classified as a schedule one

863
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,559
drug which

864
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,440
which states that there is no known

865
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,719
therapeutic

866
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,920
use which i think we've pretty much

867
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,759
disproven um and certainly your work and

868
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,280
in the work of many others have done

869
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,960
that so hopefully

870
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,480
um and sooner than later we can remove

871
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,240
that tag

872
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,838
um and before i let you go because i

873
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,838
know i'm coming up on the end of the

874
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:49,358
time that i i promise to keep you

875
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,759
um i did want to talk a bit more about

876
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,480
terpenoids flavonoids stillbinoids so

877
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,320
sort of these

878
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,838
these compounds that are present on the

879
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,280
plant that aren't necessarily

880
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,119
cannabinoids so

881
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,880
therefore they're not really interacting

882
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,760
as endocannabinoids at least i wouldn't

883
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,720
think so

884
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,680
so but are they sort of mimicking other

885
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,679
endogenous

886
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,679
compounds within the body to kind of

887
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,519
help those cannabinoids do what they

888
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,078
need to do

889
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,719
well you know for for some of them there

890
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,839
are

891
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:21,679
activities known for decades

892
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:24,960
like anti-inflammatory antioxidant

893
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,279
and some may also have specific targets

894
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,320
that

895
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,280
are certainly different from the targets

896
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,400
of the endocannabinoids so again the

897
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,519
concept of the

898
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,720
entourage effect could come out

899
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,280
here in the sense that the combination

900
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,719
of these

901
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,599
compounds non-phytocannabinoid compounds

902
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,919
together with some phytocannabinoids

903
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,039
that are present in a formulation

904
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,119
can change the react reaction of the

905
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:56,559
endogenous system to them

906
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,519
and we do not know much about these

907
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,320
interactions and these interference

908
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,239
among

909
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:07,920
components and once again this is why

910
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:11,118
we must standardize formulations

911
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,880
and investigate the effects in a

912
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,119
systematic

913
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,119
very sound manner

914
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,280
you know some people might find it maybe

915
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,400
discouraging to

916
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,720
to hear how little we still know or how

917
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,760
much work we still have to do but um

918
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:32,239
i find it fascinating and exciting that

919
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,240
there's still so much more to know and

920
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,598
so much more potential

921
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:41,199
within this plant and within this system

922
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,200
as well so i guess with that that's a

923
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,118
good place to stop

924
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,239
first i want to thank you for joining us

925
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,079
here on the podcast

926
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,319
and before i let you go i want to give

927
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,760
you an opportunity if there's

928
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,920
a website that you'd like to point

929
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,839
people to or if i don't know if you're

930
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,440
involved on social media or anything

931
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,838
like that

932
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,358
any sort of plug you want to give to the

933
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,039
work that you're doing so people who are

934
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:06,319
interested can learn more

935
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,440
it'd be great to share that ah thank you

936
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,480
so much ben i

937
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,000
actually i suggest people to look

938
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,199
through pubmed which is an official

939
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,400
uh site open public

940
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:23,598
where scientific studies are reported

941
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,160
rather than uncontrolled or less

942
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,039
scientific not to say gossip

943
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,598
that you can find easily elsewhere so

944
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,320
please

945
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,280
when you want to know more try to have a

946
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,000
good uh

947
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:41,119
source of information where it is clear

948
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,800
that things that are claimed

949
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,760
are claimed because there is a

950
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,760
scientific

951
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,358
background well recognized by the

952
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,880
scientific community

953
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:58,719
so once again you can go to pubmed

954
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,440
an nih site

955
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,279
and under my name you might find the

956
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,480
papers and whatever you want to know

957
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,839
more i'll be glad

958
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,519
to keep in contact and

959
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,960
exchange information that is excellent

960
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,079
and that is excellent advice

961
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,119
um and things beyond cannabis too always

962
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,240
make sure that you're

963
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,318
you're trusting your sources so exactly

964
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,078
