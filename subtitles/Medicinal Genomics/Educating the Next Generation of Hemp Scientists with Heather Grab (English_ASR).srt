my guest this week is heather grab

31
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,839
heather is a senior lecturer at cornell

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,079
university's school of integrated plant

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,320
science where she delivers best

34
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,199
practices for the cultivation and

35
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:38,559
processing of hemp to professionals in

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,478
cornell's hemp science mps program

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,200
she works with plant breeders

38
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,679
pathologists biochemists

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
extension professionals regulatory

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,799
officials and industry partners in new

41
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,640
york state and across the globe to

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,280
translate the latest science and

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,640
industry insights into a curriculum that

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,399
covers hemp from soil to sale

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,799
so it should come as no surprise that

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,599
our conversation covered a wide range of

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,360
topics related to hemp cultivation

48
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,359
those topics include

49
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,239
how heather got involved in studying

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
hemp

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,360
an overview of the cornell university

52
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,840
hemp research program

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
heather's research into integrated pest

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,239
management in hemp

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,680
in particular finding out which pests

56
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,920
are most harmful to outdoor hemp plants

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,640
we also talk about the wide variety of

58
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,799
hemp varieties that cornell grows in

59
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,958
their field trials and how they prevent

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,519
male fiber crops from pollinating the

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,519
cannabinoid rich plants

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,159
we discuss what is preventing hemp from

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,640
displacing other legacy crops how

64
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,359
pollinators specifically bees interact

65
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,839
with hemp plants how frost and other

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
stresses affect cannabinoid levels and

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,360
much more

68
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,439
but before i get to my conversation with

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
heather i want to thank this episode's

tissue culture technology

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,919
to date cannabis cultivators have been

77
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,319
dependent on mother plants to produce

78
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,359
clones resulting in inconsistent

79
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,639
harvests

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,800
with diluted and uncontrollable traits

81
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,279
tissue culture technology which is

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,519
widely used in industrial agriculture to

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,239
address the exact problems cannabis

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,039
cultivators face today allows conception

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,840
to quickly mass produce identical

86
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,400
disease-free plantlets with customized

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,158

93
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,479
good afternoon heather thanks for

94
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,039
joining us on the podcast

95
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,560
thanks so much for having me ben

96
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,318
all right well i'm excited to talk with

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
you today about hemp science and

98
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,399
specifically about the work you're

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,478
involved with at cornell university

100
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,879
which is one of the leading academic

101
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,319
institutions in the u.s here

102
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,439
studying the plan

103
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,800
so first

104
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,800
i was hoping you could tell the audience

105
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,478
a bit about yourself and how you got

106
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,800
involved with hemp research and how you

107
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,199
ended up at cornell

108
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
sure happy to give a brief intro to

109
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,439
myself and then to talk a little bit

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
more about our program here

111
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,319
at cornell

112
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,600
my academic background is actually in

113
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:48,000
entomology so the study of insects i did

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,040
a lot of work with small farms in the

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,918
region for my phd focused on crop

116
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,319
protection and developing integrated

117
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,519
pest management solutions that would

118
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:02,240
also be beneficial for crops that rely

119
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,478
on other insects for services

120
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,319
including pest control and biological

121
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,478
control which greenhouse growers can

122
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,759
rely on to help suppress their pest

123
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,639
populations but pollinators as well i

124
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,120
did a lot of work with wild pollinator

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,199
populations and that is actually

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,720
interestingly what got me

127
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,360
interested academically in hemp and

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,880
cannabis research so when we first

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,160
started producing

130
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:34,000
industrial hemp here in new york state

131
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,639
our team leader dr larry smart

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,120
was fielding a lot of calls from our

133
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,400
grower collaborators in that very first

134
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
year or two

135
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:46,959
asking why they were seeing so many bees

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,240
in their fiber and grain hemp crops

137
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,319
so

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,519
as somebody who is an entomologist with

139
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,519
a strong interest in bees uh he sent me

140
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,478
an email and i was like great i would

141
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,680
love to get out there to hemp fields i

142
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,918
had

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,720
a student who was working with me that

144
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:08,000
summer nate flicker on his

145
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,240
senior thesis project and he made that

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,560
sort of what his focus was for the rest

147
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,960
of the year and we went out and surveyed

148
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,120
the pollinator communities on industrial

149
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,560
hemp to see what the bees were doing

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,439
out there and after sort of getting that

151
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,478
experience in the field with hemp there

152
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:29,199
was an opportunity for me to join our

153
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,800
hemp team here full-time to teach and

154
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,439
mentor students

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,478
in our professional master's degree

156
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,680
program

157
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,038
that has

158
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,600
a whole ability for students to focus on

159
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,000
a hemp and cannabis tract within that

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
degree program and so i left for that

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,038
opportunity which is

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,680
how i joined our broader hemp team here

163
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,159
at cornell it's truly a privilege to be

164
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,598
part of this community

165
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,400
at cornell that includes academics like

166
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:02,478
myself who focus on teaching

167
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:07,120
communicating doing research

168
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:09,598
as well as extension educators who are

169
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,560
sort of this interface with the grower

170
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:15,519
community in the state to help solve

171
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,478
problems that they have and to build the

172
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,000
industry

173
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,240
so that's a little bit of the overview

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,800
of myself and the

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,360
broad research and education program

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,439
that we have here at cornell

177
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,879
excellent um and i do want to get into

178
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,199
some more detail about the work that

179
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,199
you've done with the pollinators in hemp

180
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,919
but before we do that i do want to talk

181
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,038
a bit about the program at cornell so

182
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,799
i was wondering if you could give a

183
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,560
little more detail in terms of you know

184
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,639
what does the program cover and kind of

185
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
what makes it unique from other programs

186
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,720
that are going on

187
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,120
i'm glad you asked that ben we have a

188
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,680
broad array of different

189
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,879
educational opportunities in hemp and

190
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,400
cannabis we recognize that there's a ton

191
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,479
of interest

192
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,038
in this space and we want to help

193
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,959
support and build the industry by

194
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,439
providing knowledge and helping

195
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,519
companies and individuals to answer

196
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,439
questions that they might have whether

197
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,959
they're interested in starting a new

198
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:15,199
business in the hemp space or if they

199
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,239
just want to know more about the plant

200
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,720
as a consumer we have a huge range of

201
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,280
options so of course there's sort of the

202
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,840
traditional student option for

203
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,839
undergraduates where they are already

204
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,159
going to be participating in the college

205
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,839
of ag and life sciences as an

206
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,158
undergraduate student they can take many

207
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,038
of the courses that we have developed

208
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,080
but we also uh began offering a few

209
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,000
years ago

210
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,519
this specialized track that focuses on

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,559
hemp and cannabis in our professional

212
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,919
master's degree program so we developed

213
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,679
a suite of five different courses there

214
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,559
we're considering many new ones all the

215
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,039
time

216
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,838
but we have a broad industry overview

217
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,360
course called cannabis biology society

218
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,720
industry

219
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,480
that draws from all over the university

220
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,839
law school students business school

221
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,800
students hospitality students of course

222
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,320
ag sciences and biology students take

223
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,519
that class

224
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,640
i teach a course on production systems

225
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,519
also in the fall semester that covers

226
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,240
everything from cultivar selection

227
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,639
and site selection all the way through

228
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,200
all of those cultivation practices that

229
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,360
students need to know about propagation

230
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,959
how you treat plants in the field

231
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,600
whether you're going to make decisions

232
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,159
about pruning and trellising your plants

233
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,800
harvest timing choices

234
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,240
planting density which is critical for

235
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:48,159
industrial hemp cultivation practices

236
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,959
we have courses in the spring semester

237
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,519
that focus on the processing

238
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,159
of industrial hemp

239
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,879
we also have classes that focus on

240
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:02,319
breeding and genetics of hemp

241
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:05,360
and also of course on the pharmacology

242
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,320
of the plant so how the compounds within

243
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,120
the plant interact with our own unique

244
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,959
biology and that of other organisms so

245
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,000
including things like veterinary

246
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:19,599
applications of some of these hemp

247
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,919
derived molecules so huge suite of

248
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,079
different classes and one thing that i'm

249
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,078
really excited about is that we are now

250
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:29,120
beginning to offer some of these classes

251
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,879
in an online format so the two options

252
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,240
that i talked about before those are

253
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,320
degree granting programs so either a

254
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,320
traditional bachelor's degree where you

255
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,600
might take a series of courses and

256
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,879
concentrate

257
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
in hemp

258
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,679
for your

259
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,240
undergraduate studies

260
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,719
or our professional master's degree

261
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,959
program where you're focusing on these

262
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,959
classes and then building your own

263
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,278
independent project

264
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,879
often with our industry partners to

265
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,559
solve a problem

266
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,039
but we're also beginning to offer these

267
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,838
classes online in a partnership with e

268
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,480
cornell so we already have dr larry

269
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,120
smart's hemp breeding and genetics class

270
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,200
that's launched on there my hemp

271
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,519
production system and my hemp processing

272
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
courses will be the next to go up we're

273
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
working really closely with our industry

274
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,919
partners to hear what they think are the

275
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,480
most critical skills and areas where we

276
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,599
can provide education so those might be

277
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,600
things like

278
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,159
analytical lab skills which is

279
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,560
incredibly important for this industry

280
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,799
or integrated pest management so we

281
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,039
might develop future classes that focus

282
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,278
specifically on those topics in

283
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,958
particular

284
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,879
yeah and it's it's interesting you

285
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,559
mentioned integrated pest management and

286
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,078
i it stuck out to me too when you were

287
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,439
kind of talking about your background as

288
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,799
well because

289
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
that's something that we're seeing at

290
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,120
least on our side with medicinal

291
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,479
genomics pop up more because

292
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,879
obviously we're involved in the

293
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,278
microbial testing of sort of the end

294
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,278
product and you know one of the things

295
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,360
that's coming online is irradiation

296
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,559
which we're finding has all sorts of

297
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
different issues and one of the

298
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,278
alternatives to remediating your product

299
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,120
that's that's contaminated is sort of

300
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,600
preventing that on the front end which

301
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
as i understand it ipm can really help

302
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,920
with so

303
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,518
um

304
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,078
how much work have you done with with

305
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,159
ipm on hemp and what are some of the

306
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,958
some of the things you've learned

307
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:25,600
um i have actually a grant right now

308
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,239
with my colleague marion zuffal from new

309
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,800
york state ipm so we actually have this

310
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,480
broad ipm program that's supported by

311
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,278
the state and housed at cornell

312
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,000
university to establish what's called a

313
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:41,519
crop profile for him so this is the

314
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,360
foundational material that ipm

315
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,799
practitioners would be able to look at

316
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,600
to understand crop schedules

317
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,719
cultivars that are used what kind of

318
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,639
production practices are cultivators

319
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,360
using in the system

320
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,320
and really importantly at this early

321
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,200
stage of development in the industrial

322
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,440
hemp and in the outdoor production to

323
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,120
also see what pests are going to be most

324
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,160
critical i think we have a relatively

325
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:15,440
good idea of what pests are most

326
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,559
causing issues in greenhouse and indoor

327
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,000
production

328
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,879
but as we cultivate more hemp outdoors

329
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,200
especially grain and fiber hemp learning

330
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,000
what those issues will be and trying to

331
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,560
be

332
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,639
aware of the broad array of different

333
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,599
issues that can occur across the full

334
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,320
life stage of hemp so things that attack

335
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,839
those early germinating seeds out in the

336
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,199
field like pythium for example or head

337
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,240
blights that can cause

338
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,240
the buildup of mycotoxins in grain

339
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,639
production and where what regions of the

340
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,680
country are those likely to happen or

341
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,000
even issues like pests of

342
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,799
birds for example and maybe eating grain

343
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,679
that surprisingly is a very large issue

344
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,479
here

345
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,078
in many of the research farms that we

346
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
work on there's farms that we just don't

347
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,679
plant on because the bird pressure is so

348
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,159
high that we lose a substantial portion

349
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,198
of our grain crop to birds every year so

350
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,679
just

351
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,919
understanding what the landscape is

352
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,359
so that's a project that we have funded

353
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,919
that will hopefully complete over the

354
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,240
next year with the help of some of our

355
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,719
professional masters students who might

356
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,879
take on a portion of that as their

357
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,120
capstone project that they complete in

358
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,600
the course of their degree

359
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,120
excellent well when you when you finish

360
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,759
that project i look forward to having

361
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,839
you back on to talk about that

362
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,679
um i know one of the other things that

363
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
you guys do and i saw that you just

364
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,120
posted about this it was either this

365
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
week or last week is you have a field

366
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,679
day

367
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
where you sort of present

368
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,838
all the field trials and things that you

369
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,839
guys have been working on throughout the

370
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,920
year tell us a bit about that and what

371
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
do you have planned for 2022

372
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,958
sure so

373
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:03,039
um my colleague dr daniela vergara is

374
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,439
taking the lead on organizing our field

375
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,319
day this year this is sort of

376
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,959
one of the main feature days where we

377
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,560
highlight the research and

378
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,518
the work that we're doing

379
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,759
as a hemp team here at cornell so i

380
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,799
think one of the things that makes

381
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,600
our entire team unique is that we have

382
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,879
so many different experts from across a

383
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,000
broad range of disciplines who are all

384
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,679
leveraging their unique insights skills

385
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,360
and connections with their industry

386
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,758
partners to help us

387
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,159
build solutions that are

388
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,240
really right at the point where growers

389
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,879
need them and having the opportunity for

390
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,278
growers to come out and actually see

391
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:48,958
what we're doing in the field

392
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:51,198
is so critical so daniela and her

393
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,758
colleagues in cornell cooperative

394
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:57,919
extension have been doing a great job of

395
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,519
putting together a schedule of speakers

396
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,719
for that event that will include

397
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,039
pathologists who will talk about the

398
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,278
kinds of diseases and issues that we're

399
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,679
seeing in the field across multiple

400
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,600
different market classes whether that's

401
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,000
grain fiber or

402
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,079
high cannabinoid hemp

403
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,078
we will have of course marion and myself

404
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:22,958
there talking about insect issues

405
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,120
we will have our breeders there

406
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,039
graduate students are frequently also

407
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,879
presenting some of the projects that

408
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,958
they are working on so i think a

409
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,198
personal highlight for me is always

410
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,399
seeing our cult of our trials out there

411
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,319
in the field

412
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,120
there's nowhere else i think you can go

413
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,480
where you can see as many different

414
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,919
cultivars of hemp being grown in one

415
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,240
place so we have a huge array of

416
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,439
different cultivars that we include in

417
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,360
our high cannabinoid outdoor trials but

418
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,959
also grain

419
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,839
and fiber cultivars so i think this year

420
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,439
whether

421
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,160
as long as the weather cooperates with

422
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,240
us we will have some demonstrations on

423
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,038
harvesting fiber hemp we'll talk about

424
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,160
some important processes that are

425
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:13,439
enacted by beneficial microbes in the

426
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,079
process of reading fiber hemp out there

427
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,558
so you really get to see that full

428
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:21,198
experience you're welcome to touch the

429
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:24,639
plants to get out there to smell them to

430
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,798
see what we're seeing in the field

431
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,559
on this field day so it's a great it's a

432
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,918
really great experience for those who

433
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,918
can make it to our agritech campus in

434
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,160
geneva new york

435
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,720
awesome now in the pro is the primary

436
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
audience for that event like growers

437
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,400
like maybe folks who are looking to get

438
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,400
into the industry and are trying to

439
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,919
learn as much as possible

440
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,320
um i certainly encourage growers to come

441
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,919
out of course we try to think about

442
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,918
things that are most relevant for

443
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,640
growers however

444
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,880
it's a great place also for processors

445
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,440
to be so they can understand what some

446
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,440
of the issues are that growers are

447
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,919
seeing on the field so for example if

448
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,519
you're a fiber hemp processor it's

449
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,400
beneficial for you to be there so that

450
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:13,038
you can understand and help to guide the

451
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,559
partners that you're working with on the

452
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,240
production side

453
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,678
things like cults of our choice or

454
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,558
harvest timing or post-harvest issues

455
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,038
that they might encounter same is true

456
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,038
for the high cannabinoid market as well

457
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,119
so it's great for them to get out there

458
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,359
see what those plants look like in the

459
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,079
field in our cult of our trials what

460
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,359
kind of practices you mentioned before

461
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,199
some issues with microbial contamination

462
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,319
what what are the things that we can do

463
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,798
in terms of biological controls that may

464
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,119
be really helpful in preventing issues

465
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,200
like botrytis or powdery mildew that can

466
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,038
occur either in the greenhouse or in the

467
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,080
field and how might some of the

468
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,000
applications of those crop protection

469
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,199
materials influence downstream

470
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,679
processing

471
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,840
last year we had great attendance

472
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,880
by folks who are on the analytical side

473
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:08,240
as well we usually also bring in

474
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,120
regulators who can help us to understand

475
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,919
the current regulatory landscape which

476
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,759
is always sort of in flux it seems

477
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,679
there's always new changes that are

478
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,839
happening at you know the usda level or

479
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,440
the state level within our program so

480
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,879
making sure that we're really actively

481
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,080
communicating

482
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,160
all of the

483
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,159
different reports that growers need to

484
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,279
be processing and thinking about all the

485
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,200
licenses that they need to acquire to be

486
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,359
successful

487
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,360
excellent and now you mentioned this

488
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,038
this huge array of different cultivars

489
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,199
and some being grown for cannabinoids

490
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,359
some being grown for fiber what is sort

491
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,120
of the mix there in terms of the focus

492
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,359
of the research there at your program

493
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,439
though is it primarily focused on on the

494
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,399
cannabinoids or is it fiber because i

495
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,080
know at least

496
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,038
when you look at a lot of the folks who

497
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:59,519
are are growing it commercially

498
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,839
it tends to be a lot of cannabinoids

499
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,798
yeah and i would say that's very true in

500
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,038
new york state our production has very

501
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,119
much been dominated by

502
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,480
high cannabinoid hemp in terms of

503
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,639
overall market value acreage most of the

504
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,120
markers you would look at

505
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,520
of course cannabinoid hemp has been

506
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,639
dominant and that has been a feature of

507
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:24,798
our program but we also have a lot of

508
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,679
research on the ground to help support

509
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:30,158
the development of the industrial hemp

510
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,519
industry so i would say we have a fairly

511
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,960
even distribution but of course there's

512
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,119
you know i mentioned before we have this

513
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,798
broad range of expertise within our

514
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:43,119
program so dr neil matson who leads our

515
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,759
controlled environment agriculture

516
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:48,798
program so focuses mostly on greenhouse

517
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,038
and indoor cultivation strategies of

518
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:54,079
course his lab has been focused almost

519
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,558
entirely on high cannabinoid hemp

520
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,798
production there was a little bit of

521
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:01,519
baby leaf hemp that went on

522
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,158
in indoor cultivation so some interest

523
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,918
in these like specialty niche markets

524
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,520
but i would say we're very much

525
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,960
interested in

526
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:13,679
exploring and supporting all aspects of

527
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
the hemp industry

528
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,679
excellent

529
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,360
and so

530
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,759
you know we we mentioned that a lot of

531
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,359
the commercial uh environment is really

532
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,119
focused on cannabinoids and so i have to

533
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,519
ask this for any time i talk to anyone

534
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,519
who's focused specifically on help is

535
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,079
you know why do you think hemp really

536
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,000
hasn't lived up to this this promise of

537
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,599
it being a super crop that's gonna

538
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,480
replace all these other legacy crops

539
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:42,319
it's an excellent question um of course

540
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,558
we we do hear a lot of hype um and it

541
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,158
seems like things change

542
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,279
all the time what it is that we're

543
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,880
excited about with the crop whether it's

544
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,879
carbon sequestration or replacing

545
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,080
other crops that might have a higher

546
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,840
level of environmental impact through

547
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:04,240
pesticide use or through use of limited

548
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,038
water resources in some regions and i

549
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,599
think

550
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,400
hemp is beginning to make inroads in

551
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:13,439
many of these areas but making sure that

552
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,000
all of those pieces of the supply chain

553
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,120
can come together in a coordinated

554
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,279
fashion

555
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,599
is a major

556
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,240
barrier to the development of the

557
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:27,439
industry and that's part of where

558
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,679
extension services and where

559
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,600
academia can help to come in and to

560
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,080
support some of the creation of

561
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,798
knowledge so for example

562
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,199
you know speaking with our industry

563
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,440
partners who work in

564
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,798
food applications they're really excited

565
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,759
about using hemp proteins as an

566
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:50,960
alternative to animal based proteins or

567
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,400
even to other plant-based options so for

568
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,640
example

569
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,000
almonds and cashews which are frequently

570
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,480
used in these plant-based alternatives

571
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,640
don't necessarily have the greatest

572
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,000
profile in terms of either

573
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,880
sustainability or their social equity

574
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,558
impact so having hemp as an alternative

575
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,679
is great however

576
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:16,639
we have to build the knowledge for how

577
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,120
to process and how to handle those

578
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,320
ingredients so that you know of course

579
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,479
we don't want uh to drink a hemp milk or

580
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,399
have a hemp ice cream that tastes

581
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,200
exactly like you're eating hemp hearts

582
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,519
we want it to taste like the chocolate

583
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,440
flavor or the coffee profile that is

584
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,359
supposed to be there and for other

585
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,279
proteins we have a lot of knowledge

586
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,079
about how to incorporate those into food

587
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:42,798
products so we have food scientists here

588
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,599
who are working really closely with our

589
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:48,000
plant breeders to help to develop

590
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:51,359
cultivars that can meet those specific

591
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,839
needs for the industry same is true when

592
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,719
it comes to industrial fiber

593
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:59,759
applications i think a big issue in

594
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,440
grain which i'm sure you know other

595
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,798
podcast interviewees have probably

596
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,440
mentioned is the ability to use grain

597
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:10,558
in animal feed so

598
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,200
the opportunity for that crop or some of

599
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,319
the byproducts that come from grain to

600
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,440
be able to be incorporated for poultry

601
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:22,639
or for other uses is very important so

602
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,000
right now growers who are not able to

603
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,240
market their crop into the human food

604
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,880
market for whatever reason

605
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,278
don't have any other option for where to

606
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,039
offload that crop in order to perhaps

607
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,119
recover some of the investment that they

608
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,839
have so if you're a soybean grower

609
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,639
and you had planned to have some of your

610
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,399
product used for soybean oil for human

611
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,840
consumption but for whatever reason

612
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,919
you're not able to make it into that

613
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,240
market space of course you have the

614
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,480
options to offload that product in a

615
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,880
number of other markets that we don't

616
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,599
have developed yet for hemp the good

617
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,278
news is there's many different academic

618
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,599
institutions and industry groups that

619
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,558
are working to develop those

620
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:10,158
different supply sources right now so i

621
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:12,798
think we will see him develop as a crop

622
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,400
but slow and steady will win the race

623
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:19,440
and having this integrated

624
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,360
across the board knowledge base whether

625
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,159
it's developing the right cultivars for

626
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,798
the right end uses or the right climates

627
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,120
having food scientists who are really

628
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,759
familiar with the attributes and the

629
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,119
qualities of these products all the way

630
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,798
through the supply chain that's going to

631
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,399
be really important

632
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,079
yeah well i guess that makes a lot of

633
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,480
sense that you know

634
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,798
the cannabinoid sort of supply chain or

635
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,200
processing chain like that's that's

636
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,720
pretty well established um but in order

637
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,720
to sort of

638
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,558
unseat some of these other

639
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,519
other crops that have had you know

640
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,519
decades of refinement in you know

641
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,200
optimization it's definitely gonna take

642
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,480
some time in order to get there that

643
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,038
makes sense

644
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,599
um and then i i mean from what limited

645
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:06,158
knowledge i have as i understand it just

646
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,719
you know the actual processing equipment

647
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,200
and the availability of that is somewhat

648
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,360
of a barrier as well and

649
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,319
um you know in getting ready for this

650
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,798
podcast i did see that colorado they

651
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,720
just had a proposal up there to use five

652
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,440
million dollars of their cannabis tax

653
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,679
collection funds to buy processing

654
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,320
equipment for that reason too to sort of

655
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,200
help support uh hemp growers in that

656
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:34,079
state but unfortunately that got quashed

657
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,759
so how much of a barrier is sort of just

658
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,278
processing equipment or processing

659
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,879
facilities

660
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:43,278
processing facilities are a

661
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,720
a big challenge in terms of developing

662
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,440
the industry so

663
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,759
there's a bit of a chicken and egg

664
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,840
issue that we have in developing

665
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,879
especially the fiber

666
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,720
side of the industrial hemp market so

667
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,039
for grain there's a whole lot of

668
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,480
infrastructure out there that's fairly

669
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,640
easy to adapt to handle oil seed crops

670
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,319
like hemp grain of course there's some

671
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,640
you know unique issues with

672
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,960
incorporating those into food products

673
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,278
that i mentioned before but with fiber

674
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,200
hemp it's really about these very large

675
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,159
capital investments in

676
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,840
facilities so five million dollars is

677
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,200
really a drop in the bucket when we

678
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:26,720
think about what it costs to

679
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,759
establish even one of these processing

680
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,240
facilities we are fortunate in that

681
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,519
there are many companies who have

682
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,480
already been gaining experience

683
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,960
with fiber hemp processing mostly in

684
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,679
europe so a lot of equipment that was

685
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,399
traditionally used to process flax

686
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,960
in northern europe can be fairly easily

687
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:52,000
adapted to handle

688
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,840
fiber hemp as well there's

689
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,720
of course france has been cultivating

690
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,480
fibre hemp and germany on a large scale

691
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,600
for a while now but some of the

692
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,558
companies

693
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,759
um

694
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:06,398
cretes or la roche those companies that

695
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,558
are producing this equipment so

696
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,158
building those individual pieces of

697
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,240
equipment is a challenge right now due

698
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,278
to supply chain issues but even if it

699
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,120
wasn't

700
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,159
a single piece of equipment from one of

701
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,079
those companies can run anywhere up to

702
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,000
three million dollars depending on the

703
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,079
size and the type of processing

704
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,839
equipment that we want to import so

705
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,278
that's a substantial

706
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,519
investment

707
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,519
and then at the same time those

708
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,519
processors that are coming into that

709
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,679
middle space in the market

710
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,960
also need to be coordinating with the

711
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,919
manufacturers who are going to take that

712
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,319
processed material and convert that into

713
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,320
a final product whether that's a textile

714
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,960
that goes on to

715
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:52,398
use in clothing or automobiles or

716
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,480
furniture other sources or an insulation

717
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:57,038
product or a hemp cream block something

718
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,159
like that and they also need to

719
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:02,960
coordinate with the producers who are on

720
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,440
the cultivation side helping them to

721
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,360
choose the right genetics and to make

722
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,919
sure that there will be someone there if

723
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,839
they plant their crop that in a couple

724
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,120
months that there will actually be

725
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:18,398
someone in place to purchase and utilize

726
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:20,158
that crop that they have invested in so

727
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,798
that is sort of the challenge of

728
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:26,559
building up this entire industry where

729
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:30,240
do we start um the having that sort of

730
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:32,480
middle processing component in place is

731
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,880
very important but it's also

732
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,278
a fine line to walk for those who are

733
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,159
investing in that space because they

734
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,960
have to manage both sides of the market

735
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:46,000
but of course they're also in a very

736
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,480
unique place to have the opportunity to

737
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,720
help to set the standards and to build

738
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,240
that supply chain so

739
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,278
wow

740
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
so

741
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,119
and now you mentioned different

742
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,839
applications whether it be for um you

743
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,719
know a textile or hemp crete or anything

744
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,398
like that so is the actual processing of

745
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,919
the material different for those

746
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,158
different applications

747
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,440
absolutely yes

748
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,640
so even in in the textile space there is

749
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,519
processing equipment and even in the

750
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,320
field harvesting methods that you would

751
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,519
use if you want to produce a long

752
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,278
textile fiber so i have an example here

753
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,639
you can't see it but it's you know a

754
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:31,278
very long fiber so the reading practices

755
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,640
that you use how you harvest it you want

756
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:37,278
to of course keep all of the individual

757
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,520
stems parallel for that so they're not

758
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:42,079
all mixed together how they would be for

759
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,798
example for hay so keeping everything

760
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,879
parallel from the point of harvest all

761
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,278
the way through processing is very

762
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,480
important the kind of equipment that you

763
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:52,079
use

764
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,759
whether you're going to do switching and

765
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,519
hackling there's all these fun terms

766
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:57,440
that come into play in the fiber hemp

767
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,359
processing world

768
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,360
the choices that you're making there are

769
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,359
different than if you want to produce

770
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,479
what we might call cottonized hemps so

771
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,398
that is really short fiber hemp that

772
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,679
could then be used for spinning so if

773
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:13,199
you're thinking about developing a 100

774
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,759
hemp t-shirt

775
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,278
you're going to go for a cottonized hemp

776
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:21,599
product and the manufacturing line

777
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,880
so from the field processing line it's

778
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,398
going to look very different it's

779
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,080
similar so i think a lot of your

780
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,158
audience is really familiar with all the

781
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:31,119
different choices you can make in

782
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,919
processing high cannabinoid hemp if you

783
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,839
want to make a hash product you're going

784
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,120
to make a ton of different choices

785
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,278
you're going to select different

786
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,439
cultivars based on their trichome

787
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,759
architecture and development you're

788
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,480
going to take those plants potentially

789
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:49,359
freeze them right after harvest rather

790
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,278
than dry and cure them so all of those

791
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,278
things are very different depending on

792
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:57,679
the final product and it's exactly the

793
00:31:53,278 --> 00:32:00,880
same for fiber hemp processing as well

794
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,640
excellent all right all right um so

795
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,000
let's talk about bees

796
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,960
because i don't know we're running out

797
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,839
of time here and i don't want to make

798
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,440
sure that we talk about that so um tell

799
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,079
us a bit about the research that you did

800
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,399
looking into how um hemp can support

801
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,278
some of the pollinator population

802
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,879
sure

803
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:22,000
so um nate and i when we took on this

804
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,799
project um we were able to connect with

805
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
a lot of growers who had formal

806
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:30,558
collaborations with our university

807
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,319
during the early days of our hemp

808
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,798
production program here in new york

809
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,720
state all of our growers were

810
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:37,839
essentially collaborating in some shape

811
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,558
or form

812
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:43,199
with our land-grant universities to help

813
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,000
understand what the challenges would be

814
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,240
so

815
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,960
we were welcomed to come and visit many

816
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,120
of the farms across the state to see

817
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,240
what their challenges were in the field

818
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:57,199
but also to see what opportunities have

819
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,640
presented and in this case we found a

820
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,840
huge array of different bee species that

821
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,240
were visiting industrial hemp fields

822
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:10,639
and the reason that they were there was

823
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,599
to collect pollen from male plants so

824
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,600
unlike cannabinoid hemp production where

825
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:20,558
you want a completely female field so

826
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:23,359
every plant would be female in grain and

827
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:27,200
fiber hemp production we have mixed

828
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:29,439
stands of both female and male plants or

829
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,600
in some cases we even have monicious

830
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,320
plants which means that they're actually

831
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,558
selected to produce both male and female

832
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,918
flowers on the same plant which is

833
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:43,038
uncommon for hemp generally but we do

834
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,000
see that happening so they're out there

835
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:49,038
collecting pollen hemp and cannabis

836
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,558
generally produces no nectar for the

837
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,879
bees so they're really just there to

838
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,480
collect that pollen and they use that

839
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,440
pollen if they've collected it bring it

840
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,159
back to their nests and then feed their

841
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,519
developing offspring on that most people

842
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,440
are of course really familiar with

843
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,720
honeybees and after we published this

844
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,918
paper we got a lot of buzz

845
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,358
around maybe the ability to produce um

846
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,719
high cannabinoid honeys for example

847
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:16,480
however

848
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,439
you know while the bees seem to very

849
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,838
much focus their foraging attention on

850
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,320
hemp even when other floral resources

851
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,000
are available to them in terms of the

852
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,838
overall scheme of what they're bringing

853
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,159
back to their hives at least in a

854
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:33,199
diverse region like we have here in new

855
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,079
york state it's pretty small and

856
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,759
the pollen which does have cannabinoids

857
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:43,200
in it still at such a low level that you

858
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:47,599
would really need to eat a substantial

859
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:50,960
portion of honey in order to get even a

860
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,639
small dose i think i calculated out a 25

861
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,760
milligram dose

862
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,880
of cannabinoids would take you about a

863
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,040
thousand pounds of honey or more

864
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,559
to just at the natural level so that's

865
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,039
not to say there are other folks out

866
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,279
there who are experimenting with

867
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,800
different methods of introducing

868
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,200
cannabinoids to hives or

869
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,599
sort of focusing more of the foraging

870
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,118
effort of a colony on

871
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,280
hemp and cannabis

872
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,000
but i would say if you're

873
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,760
getting hemp honey advertised to you

874
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,800
it's almost certainly not something

875
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,800
that's a

876
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,560
naturally created process and

877
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,720
spontaneous it's

878
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,719
most likely cannabinoids that have been

879
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:37,759
added to a honey product after the bees

880
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:40,559
were involved so i'm still very much

881
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,800
interested in beneficial insects

882
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:45,279
including bees that might be supported i

883
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,359
have many of the bee species that we

884
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,599
found so outside of the european

885
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,559
honeybee of course we have

886
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,800
bumblebees which are native here we had

887
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:59,039
a wide array of other small native bees

888
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,440
that we're using hemp many of which are

889
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,880
very important pollinators of other

890
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,119
crops so

891
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,880
pollinators of tomatoes apples

892
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,039
strawberries blueberries squash pumpkins

893
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,800
all of these other really high value

894
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,119
crops which

895
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,720
you know may be lacking floral resources

896
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,039
on the farm at the period when those

897
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,759
crops aren't blooming and hemp can help

898
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,000
to fill that gap when there's no other

899
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,560
flowers around it can support some of

900
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,280
those bees of course we also need to be

901
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,199
aware that it's not providing nectar

902
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,960
so thinking not only about the resources

903
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:36,399
that it provides but also if we're going

904
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,240
to make crop protection choices we need

905
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,280
to account for the fact that there could

906
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:43,598
be beneficial insects like pollinators

907
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,440
there and to think about that for even

908
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,920
these crops that are not pollinator

909
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,519
dependent but maybe supporting a lot of

910
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,280
beneficial insects as well

911
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,199
yeah so so what's the difference between

912
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,720
pollen and i mean obviously there is a

913
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,239
difference between pollen and nectar but

914
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,399
in terms of the bees

915
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,159
how do they use each oh thank you so

916
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,160
much for asking i feel like i'm such a

917
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,960
bug nerd that i

918
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:10,960
don't always think about what people who

919
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,679
aren't as focused on bees and the floral

920
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,240
resources and rewards that they provide

921
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,000
are doing so nectar is usually sort of

922
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,799
that sugary

923
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,159
secretion that often comes from the base

924
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,720
of petals for example so hemp does not

925
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,960
provide that many other crops buckwheat

926
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,639
for example is a crop that provides

927
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,199
great resources

928
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,759
goldenrod which we have abundantly here

929
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,319
in the northeast is an excellent floral

930
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,760
resource that provides a ton of nectar

931
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,160
but pollen is really the key protein

932
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,320
source for bees so i mentioned before

933
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,719
that bees are collecting all of that

934
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,039
pollen and in the process of collecting

935
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,679
they're pollinating our crops but that's

936
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,920
really secondary in their objective it's

937
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:59,358
really not necessarily an objective of

938
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,358
theirs at all but they are actually

939
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:04,719
collecting that pollen and bringing it

940
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:07,519
back to their nests in order to feed

941
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:10,480
their developing offspring so the almost

942
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,960
entire life cycle of a bee is spent

943
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,400
underground in most cases eighty percent

944
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,639
of bees nest in the ground or in their

945
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,838
nest and they consume pollen as larvae

946
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,358
and then develop into a bee so most of

947
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,358
the time they're in this larval stage

948
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:28,880
underground and it's only maybe a few

949
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,799
weeks out of the year for most bee

950
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,440
species that we see them

951
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,400
in their characteristic b

952
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,800
form so really important protein source

953
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,400
for them these are actually sort of

954
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,359
carnivores but focused on this

955
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,519
high protein resource that's provided by

956
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:49,598
plants so

957
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,880
interesting and you mentioned that it

958
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,359
seems like the bees actually prefer hemp

959
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,440
to other you know flowers that may be in

960
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,759
the area yeah we haven't done a big

961
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,320
formal study of that but i was really

962
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,560
shocked to have observed

963
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,200
these that had many other floral

964
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,838
resources available to them

965
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,799
seemingly focusing heavily

966
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,960
on the hemp crop so in one of our large

967
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,359
fiber trials last year

968
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,440
there was a ton of bees visiting that

969
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,920
planting all day long

970
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,599
a large field of buckwheat planted right

971
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,400
next to it as i mentioned that's a crop

972
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,760
that provides a great source of nectar

973
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,320
very few bees on that crop um fields of

974
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,440
clover cover crop nearby

975
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,160
also a high protein source of pollen

976
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,358
very few bees they were really excited

977
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:43,440
about foraging on the hemp potentially

978
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,559
because the pollen is so much more

979
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,720
easily accessible on hemp plants because

980
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:53,039
they're releasing it onto the wind so

981
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,439
um i'm really interested to look though

982
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:56,639
to see if there are potential benefits

983
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,639
of

984
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,400
having access to

985
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:03,039
this unique floral resource either

986
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,240
because of its nutritional composition

987
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,358
high protein relative to other sources

988
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,959
perhaps

989
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:13,920
or if there are any effects of these

990
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,679
cannabinoid or terpene molecules that

991
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,920
may be present in the hemp pollen that

992
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,799
could have beneficial effects for the

993
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,358
bees so bees don't have endocannabinoid

994
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,839
systems like we do actually no insects

995
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:32,799
have the active cb1 cb2 receptors that

996
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:35,759
typically is you know that's how we

997
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,720
sense the effects of cannabinoids in our

998
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,079
own body insects lack those but that

999
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,959
doesn't mean that they're not having

1000
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,560
other effects beneficial or otherwise on

1001
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,400
those insects there's been some

1002
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,599
speculation about

1003
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,160
potential

1004
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,240
effects of cannabinoids in

1005
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,358
mitigating some of the diseases that

1006
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,919
we're really worried about and

1007
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,960
pollinator populations right now so

1008
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,200
it would be

1009
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,079
great to have the opportunity to work

1010
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:04,399
with a student on a project like that

1011
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,839
excellent excellent and now when you

1012
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,400
mentioned

1013
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:11,599
that um you know when hemp is being

1014
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,000
grown for fiber or for um

1015
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,079
well for fiber that you know the concern

1016
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,358
about having males isn't as high

1017
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,880
obviously because you know it's not

1018
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:23,199
going to produce seeds in your flour so

1019
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,000
now i'm thinking back to your your field

1020
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,679
day

1021
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,519
at cornell where you said that you're

1022
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,239
growing both for fiber and for

1023
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,759
cannabinoids so how do you manage how do

1024
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,759
you manage that and make sure that some

1025
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,800
of the male pollen or do you not grow

1026
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,520
males

1027
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,359
so we absolutely have male plants in our

1028
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,599
green and fiber trials so for our

1029
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,598
cultivars that are not monica so

1030
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,359
producing both male and female on the

1031
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:50,480
same plant for grain production we need

1032
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:53,199
those uh male plants there to pollinate

1033
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,800
our female plants and to produce grain

1034
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:59,199
in fiber actually male plants have some

1035
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,000
benefit some positive attributes

1036
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,919
relative to female plants especially for

1037
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,920
textile production they tend to have

1038
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,960
finer fiber structures on them so

1039
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,400
we really do want to have a lot of males

1040
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,639
in our production for those plants so

1041
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,440
what we do is we spend a lot of time

1042
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,838
coordinating among our entire research

1043
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,318
team so we have you know we have this

1044
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,799
issue in many different flavors so

1045
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:31,199
pollen transfer certainly won and we are

1046
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:34,880
lucky at cornell to have a really large

1047
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:37,598
system of research farms spread across

1048
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,079
the region so we have facilities on long

1049
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,440
island we have facilities at our

1050
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,440
agro-tech campus in geneva farms here in

1051
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,960
our ithaca region and then other

1052
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,280
research farms that are spread out

1053
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,000
across the state that can help us to

1054
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,800
achieve some separation so of course

1055
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,199
though at our agritech campus which is

1056
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,800
part of our research hub for cannabis

1057
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,239
and hemp um we have a lot of programs

1058
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,800
going on there

1059
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:07,279
interested in fiber grain and

1060
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,760
cannabinoid production and so we try to

1061
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,359
space our plants around if you go to our

1062
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,640
page that talks about all of the

1063
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,960
research work that we do there we

1064
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,759
actually did a study a few years back

1065
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,838
looking at how far pollen is likely to

1066
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,079
move and where that risk of pollination

1067
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,559
is and so we do a good job of

1068
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,440
coordinating the placement of our

1069
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,838
different trials so that our fiber cult

1070
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,159
of our trial is not pollinating our high

1071
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,239
cannabinoid trials we also work with

1072
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,879
industry partners who are developing new

1073
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,598
cultivars so an example of this is the

1074
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,280
triploid genetics that are being

1075
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,680
produced uh so we are really involved in

1076
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,480
researching those cultivars and sort of

1077
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,239
giving them a really good pollen heavy

1078
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,318
challenge and that was part of our field

1079
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,239
day last year those who came to the

1080
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:59,599
field day could actually see

1081
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:02,879
these triploid cultivars grown in an in

1082
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,119
an area right next to a large fiber

1083
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,160
production field where there was an

1084
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,000
incredibly high pressure of pollen and

1085
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:12,239
to see how well they perform in that

1086
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,639
environment

1087
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,000
wow that's that's really cool

1088
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,159
all right i've already kept you over the

1089
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,639
time that i promised but i before i let

1090
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:22,000
you go i did want to just ask you you

1091
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,279
mentioned that you work a lot with your

1092
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,119
students on on capstone projects um so i

1093
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,040
want to give you an opportunity to to

1094
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,720
talk about some of the ones that have

1095
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,800
really stood out or i know that you

1096
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,358
mentioned that one of them just recently

1097
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,440
published so let's talk a bit about that

1098
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,920
sure yeah i would say that's

1099
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,000
one of the great privileges that i have

1100
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,280
in my role on the hemp team here at

1101
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,159
cornell is mentoring our

1102
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,599
hemp professional degree students in

1103
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:53,358
their capstone projects so throughout

1104
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,680
the course of the fall and spring

1105
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,440
semester and usually also into the

1106
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,519
summer our students are working

1107
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,280
intensively on whatever area is really

1108
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,039
of interest to them so i mentioned

1109
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,200
before we have this really broad

1110
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,039
curriculum because we want students

1111
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,519
especially who are in

1112
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:14,800
our professional master's program to

1113
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,159
really understand all components of the

1114
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,480
industry because we believe that's

1115
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:21,679
critical for helping to build a

1116
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,800
workforce and to build a well-integrated

1117
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:27,679
strong industry but we recognize also

1118
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,839
that students come with a desire to

1119
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:33,838
focus in particular areas whether that's

1120
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:36,000
understanding lighting issues and what

1121
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,599
the most effective lighting practices

1122
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,679
are or

1123
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,280
maybe processing and analytical

1124
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,598
challenges and so

1125
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,359
each student sort of has the option to

1126
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,000
work with

1127
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,880
industry partners and most critically

1128
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,480
with really strong mentorship from our

1129
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,358
faculty to help to design a project that

1130
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,559
they can tackle which ideally addresses

1131
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,358
a challenge

1132
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:04,000
within the industry and so um the one

1133
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,480
that was just actually published today

1134
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,239
uh congrats to andre gallis who led this

1135
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,199
project uh was based on an observation

1136
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:17,679
that andre had with some cultivators who

1137
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:20,199
were working in vermont so back in

1138
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,759
it was probably the fall of

1139
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:23,679
2019

1140
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,839
that he was in dialogue with some

1141
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:29,039
growers in the northeast that had

1142
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:30,719
experienced that fall a really hard

1143
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,279
frost

1144
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:35,039
just prior to harvesting their crop and

1145
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,160
in some cases they lost their crop in

1146
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,838
other cases they were able to recover

1147
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,838
some of that harvest but they really

1148
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:44,159
were interested in understanding what

1149
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,400
impact that would have

1150
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,719
on their plants or what happened so as

1151
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,599
the climate becomes more variable these

1152
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,439
frosts become less predictable how what

1153
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,079
would happen if that had happened

1154
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,880
earlier in you know the early flowering

1155
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,960
stage so andre set out to design this

1156
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,640
experiment to help answer that question

1157
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:07,119
exactly he grew out plants starting at

1158
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:10,318
different dates so that he would have an

1159
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,960
array of three different ages he did

1160
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:15,519
some acclimation experiments where he

1161
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,800
allowed some of those to sort of come to

1162
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:20,880
this gradual cool temperature

1163
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,359
and then some of those plants as well as

1164
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,480
some that had not been acclimated

1165
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,039
were exposed

1166
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,880
to different amounts of freezing

1167
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,880
so some got one

1168
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,160
freezing for a few hours and some had

1169
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,480
consecutive multiple freezing stresses

1170
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:39,838
on them he measured a whole bunch of

1171
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,639
plant stress responses as well as

1172
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,480
looking at the final biomass that was

1173
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:46,879
produced by those plants in terms of the

1174
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,599
flower biomass which is most important

1175
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,519
for our growers and we also looked at

1176
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,480
how that might impact cannabinoid

1177
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:57,358
profiles so some other work that has

1178
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,838
also been published out of our hemp team

1179
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,759
program here led by jacob toth

1180
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:04,799
fantastic experiment looking at how

1181
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,800
stress influences cannabinoid profiles

1182
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,200
that was a big concern in the industry

1183
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,480
especially when we think about that

1184
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,000
0.3

1185
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,838
limit there's been debate about bringing

1186
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,800
that up to 1

1187
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:20,000
and what he found is that stress is not

1188
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,400
a big factor in driving plants above

1189
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,559
that compliance threshold of three

1190
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,000
percent so he tested plants with

1191
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,760
herbicides he did damage he did many

1192
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,838
different things to stress these plants

1193
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,720
out and really

1194
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:37,279
underscore the fact that it's based on

1195
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,679
the plant's genetics that drive that

1196
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,920
change so with cannabinoids we also

1197
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,960
expected that to be the case with this

1198
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,000
cold stress as well so what is the

1199
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,880
impact of cold stress on the changes in

1200
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,400
cannabinoid profile generally not much

1201
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,720
we see that of course there are

1202
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,920
differences among cultivars but one

1203
00:48:54,719 --> 00:49:01,279
thing we are concerned about in terms of

1204
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:04,318
frost especially very late in harvest is

1205
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,240
the potential to actually lose trichomes

1206
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,960
through physical

1207
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,639
impact on the plant so of course we're

1208
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,639
thinking about

1209
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,799
making an ice water hash for example we

1210
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,639
know we get those trichomes really cold

1211
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,880
they become very fragile

1212
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,558
so that's something that we were also

1213
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,640
looking for in that publication and i'll

1214
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,319
make sure to pass that on to you so you

1215
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:25,358
can include a link to that in your show

1216
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:27,759
notes

1217
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,279
yeah i will absolutely do that and

1218
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,079
no that's interesting that stress

1219
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,000
doesn't seem to have um you know a big

1220
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,800
impact on cannabinoids but i'm curious

1221
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,480
what about terpenes um because as i

1222
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,599
understand it you know terpenes can sort

1223
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,000
of be used to ward off pests or be sort

1224
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,318
of a response to stress so did you find

1225
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,760
anything there we did not look at

1226
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:53,199
terpenes in either jacob or andre's

1227
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,760
study however we are very excited to

1228
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:58,480
begin incorporating studies looking at

1229
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,400
terpenes in a lot of our research going

1230
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:04,960
forward so

1231
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:09,039
we have a an hplc in our teaching lab we

1232
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,679
also have now a new mini gc

1233
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:14,400
from lucidity systems which is a cem

1234
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:17,279
corporation so that allows us to

1235
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,240
evaluate plants that we grow out and use

1236
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,359
in our courses for both the cannabinoid

1237
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:25,279
profile and their terpene profiles i'm

1238
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,039
really excited to work with students on

1239
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,680
developing methods that are tailored to

1240
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,838
those machines our

1241
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,960
big testing lab on campus of our

1242
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:37,838
research analytical facility has a

1243
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,639
really excellent new gc system from

1244
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:42,880
agilent which is sort of sole purpose i

1245
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:45,759
mean you can use it from anything but we

1246
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,358
will be using it solely for looking at

1247
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,559
terpene profiles in our research program

1248
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:53,358
here for

1249
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,960
hemp so very excited to start looking at

1250
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:59,519
that more to see how stress may impact

1251
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,440
uh terpene profiles or just regular

1252
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,759
cultivation practices could be

1253
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,960
influencing them or genetics there's a

1254
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,200
whole bunch of different angles that

1255
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,880
we're excited to work on

1256
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:10,159
excellent okay

1257
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,000
so

1258
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,000
thanks again for staying late um but

1259
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,039
before i let you go i do want to give

1260
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,358
you an opportunity to plug any websites

1261
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:22,159
social media anything that people can do

1262
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:23,519
to get in touch with you or just follow

1263
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:26,399
what you're working on

1264
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,519
sure yeah so folks can find me

1265
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,838
on the um cal school of integrative

1266
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,719
plant sciences website

1267
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:37,199
i am on linkedin also it's a great place

1268
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:40,959
to connect with me i would encourage

1269
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:43,598
folks to attend our field day in august

1270
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,318
in geneva if they can make it if not uh

1271
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,240
there may potentially be some recordings

1272
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,400
that could be made of that

1273
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:53,919
and there's always handouts from our

1274
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,400
field days that are posted on our hemp

1275
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,680
team research and extension page if you

1276
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,559
just google

1277
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,318
uh cornell hemp you will

1278
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,400
almost certainly find that as the very

1279
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:07,358
top response on your page and you will

1280
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,318
find all of our faculty who are involved

1281
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:14,078
with different areas of research and all

1282
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:16,079
of the many many reports that we have

1283
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,839
been producing so it's a great place if

1284
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,400
you're an industry member who's looking

1285
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:22,558
to partner with cornell to get in touch

1286
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,639
with faculty who have expertise in

1287
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,559
different areas i will also put out a

1288
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,759
plug for any industry members who are

1289
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,400
excited about

1290
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,000
working with our professional

all of the students who have worked with

1293
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:40,558
me in our professional master's program

1294
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,119
focused on hemp have done capstone

1295
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,359
projects in collaboration with industry

1296
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,960
partners it's been a great success so
