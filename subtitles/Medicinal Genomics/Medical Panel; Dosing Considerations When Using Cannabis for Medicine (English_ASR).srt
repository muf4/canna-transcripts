1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,410
hello this is the age-old question right

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:09,210
like how much is enough so I just want

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,589
to start this conversation by saying

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,389
that we've got a panel of experts here

5
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:20,009
medical doctors clinicians that actually

6
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:21,539
have a ton of experience dosing and so I

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,150
think we're gonna have a lot of super

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,449
valuable information here and I also

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,948
want to start by kind of turning the

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,660
dosing model on its head because one of

11
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,710
the things that we've learned to do in

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,950
in medical schools and FNP schools and

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,359
whatnot is pharmacological dosing so I

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,070
want to talk about pharmacological

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,539
dosing versus physiological dosing and

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,000
this may be new to some of you but the

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,960
idea of physical physiological dosing is

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,128
using the amount the least amount to get

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,469
the effect you want

20
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,570
now you can as imagine quickly that this

21
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,550
is labor intensive it's labor intensive

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,350
for the patient and it's labor intensive

23
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,538
for the clinician because I have to

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,338
follow it but it's a good model of

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,189
dosing and if we followed a model like

26
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:10,289
that we would actually have a medical

27
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:12,688
system that didn't kill 80 to 100

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,060
thousand people a year based on properly

29
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:19,048
prescribed pharmaceuticals and that is a

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,478
real number by the year so what we'll do

31
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,950
here is let me quickly say hello to

32
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,450
everybody all right you've got on the

33
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,790
end you've got Karen McClellan dr.

34
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,710
Guerin McClellan you got dr. Michelle

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,520
she'll fit and you've got dr. Bonnie

36
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,759
goldstein

37
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,280
we've got doctrine Dustin Sulak and then

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,728
I'm dr. Kevin spelling but not that kind

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,099
of doctor but another kind of doctor and

40
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:47,280
what we'll do here part one we'll jump

41
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:51,298
into and I'm sorry for the popping part

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,060
one we'll jump into some slides and then

43
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,310
part two will actually have a robust

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,390
discussion based on what's the right

45
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,570
amount so and Michelle I think you're up

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,570
first

47
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,159
Thank You Kevin and thank you everyone

48
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:14,560
for coming out this afternoon my name is

49
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,629
Michele chef it and I work with Columbia

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,340
care I'm not sure how many of you are

51
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:21,159
familiar with Columbia care with their

52
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,129
medical cannabis manufacturer they

53
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:27,759
create and sell precision formulated

54
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:29,590
unit-dose medical cannabis products and

55
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,199
what do I mean by that it's basically

56
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,598
like a pharmaceutical product each dose

57
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,280
tells you exactly how many milligrams

58
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:40,119
you're going to get in a particular

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,799
tablet tincture vaporization that sort

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,750
of thing and it really helps patients

61
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:45,760
because it allows them to be able to

62
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,949
titrate the products in a safe and

63
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,219
effective way we're licensed to operate

64
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:53,649
in 15 different jurisdictions in the US

65
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,699
and the EU and I'm going to talk mostly

66
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,620
about New York

67
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,109
we are bringing precision formulated

68
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,759
products to California later this fall

69
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,380
but the data that we're going to talk

70
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,769
about today is from our New York

71
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:08,590
database so since we started in New York

72
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:12,549
we've delivered almost 12 million doses

73
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,959
of medical cannabis to patients and the

74
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:15,969
database we're looking at today is what

75
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,069
we call the impact database and I'm

76
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:19,900
gonna this kind of moves around here I'm

77
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:22,479
gonna talk a little bit about our

78
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,599
general population and then also talk

79
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,818
about a cohort of older versus younger

80
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,259
and if you were here before for the

81
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:31,449
previous presentation I think

82
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:33,099
Aloise did a fabulous job talking about

83
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:35,379
some of the special needs in the elderly

84
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,000
population and the reasons why medical

85
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:40,750
cannabis is super important for that

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,909
particular group so let's jump right in

87
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,340
with the general population in New York

88
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:46,539
the way the rules work in New York is

89
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,989
you have to have a qualifying condition

90
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:52,060
and then also an Associated condition or

91
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,400
symptom and the number one condition in

92
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,769
New York as you might imagine is chronic

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,680
pain about 50% of patients have that

94
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,849
listed on their certification number two

95
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,560
is neuropathy and number three is cancer

96
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:07,780
the average age is fifty three point

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,699
five and we're actually pretty equally

98
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,840
balanced with about half female half

99
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:16,358
male now let's look at the dosing that

100
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,730
these patients get so to kind of set you

101
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,949
up from a dosing perspective

102
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,710
we have THC on the left-hand side of the

103
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,139
slide and we have CBD on the right-hand

104
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:26,819
side of the slide and the way we look at

105
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,699
the dose is we look at the patient's

106
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:33,329
first invoice versus their most recent

107
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,219
invoice and we compare that over time so

108
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:36,959
we have it divided up in quartiles and

109
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,170
we also have a median and a mean value

110
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,579
and if you start with the THC side what

111
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,560
you'll see and I don't think this would

112
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,810
surprise anyone in the room is that the

113
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,790
THC dose gradually goes up over time

114
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,459
between the first and most recent

115
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,569
invoice whereas the CBD dose on the

116
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,029
right hand side you'll see that that

117
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,519
trends downward with the first versus

118
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:59,819
most recent invoice and if we look at

119
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,919
the averages the mean THC daily dose for

120
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,459
that patient population is about 31

121
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:09,710
milligrams and the mean CBD dose for

122
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:12,149
that population has about 14 milligrams

123
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:15,389
so now we'll switch and we'll talk about

124
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:17,699
that younger versus older cohort and

125
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,339
again you know Eloise explained it very

126
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,170
eloquently we know that 80% of the

127
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,089
elderly population has multiple chronic

128
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,590
conditions they take multiple

129
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,349
medications their healthcare is

130
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:30,449
extremely costly complicated and it

131
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,189
impacts their quality of life and we

132
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,839
look at medical cannabis as a safe and

133
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:36,120
effective alternative for these patients

134
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,739
and we wanted to understand if there are

135
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,480
any considerations based on the

136
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,300
information we have within that patient

137
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,750
population so we decided to split it up

138
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,800
as 45 and under being younger seventy

139
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:53,069
plus being older the 45 in under group

140
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,920
was about 50% female and the top three

141
00:05:53,069 --> 00:06:00,240
conditions were chronic pain neuropathy

142
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,860
and IBD with the older population it was

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,980
a little bit more skewed towards the

144
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,680
female side almost 60% top three

145
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,290
conditions where chronic pain neuropathy

146
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,090
and cancer so the difference was kind of

147
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,220
in just number three there but you'll

148
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:16,619
notice that the 70 plus group had a

149
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,570
higher percentage of neuropathy overall

150
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,740
and I think that's important when we

151
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:24,689
look at the different doses so this time

152
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,689
we're gonna have just THC on the slide

153
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:29,699
we have the younger group on the Left we

154
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:31,529
have the older group on the right and

155
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,259
you see the same trend

156
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:37,079
the dose goes up first versus most

157
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,629
recent invoice and the median dose in

158
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,579
that elderly population is lower than

159
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,069
the younger population ten point five

160
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,139
versus sixteen point nine as you might

161
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:48,089
imagine when when we dosed these

162
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,620
patients were very careful to start the

163
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:52,109
elderly population on the smallest

164
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,819
possible dose of THC for all the reasons

165
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,050
that we know very well you know we don't

166
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,129
want to have a fall we don't want to

167
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:01,319
have disorientation or confusion if we

168
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:03,569
look at the CBD side again you see the

169
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,939
same exact trend as we saw with the

170
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:08,699
general population the doses go down

171
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:11,040
over time and the median dose for the

172
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,329
elderly seven point to and from the

173
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,330
adult populate are the younger

174
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:17,069
population four point six milligrams and

175
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:19,349
again I think this is probably related

176
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,810
to the fact that these patients had more

177
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,520
neuropathy and what we found in our

178
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,699
experience with the patients in New York

179
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:30,930
is that the higher CBD doses work best

180
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,819
for patients with neuropathy so what

181
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,009
about adverse effects and satisfaction

182
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,629
with therapy before I jump into that I

183
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,969
want you to understand a little bit more

184
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:41,219
about our different product formulations

185
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,950
they're set up into basically three

186
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,660
categories in the formulated products we

187
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:49,649
have Thera seed which is a high THC

188
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,960
product LS seed which is equal and clara

189
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:53,668
seed which is a higher CBD product and

190
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,889
the ratios are twenty to one in either

191
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:57,990
direction or one to one for the middle

192
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,750
group and if you look at the elderly

193
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,759
population they took about the same of

194
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,470
each of those three types of products

195
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,389
maybe a little bit more Thera see but

196
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,729
not too much because a couple percentage

197
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,189
points higher whereas the younger

198
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:13,079
population took almost twice as much

199
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,810
Thera seed as they did the other two

200
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,250
formulated products but the thing that

201
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,379
we found most interesting and we were

202
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,930
most excited to see is the satisfaction

203
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,909
with therapy was exactly the same across

204
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,650
both groups they were taking the

205
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,210
medication in a dose that was

206
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:29,189
appropriate and they felt like they were

207
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:32,250
getting relief from their symptomatology

208
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:34,320
it was also safe with the most common

209
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,330
adverse event being increased appetite

210
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,830
and that was seen in 25 percent of

211
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,919
patients regardless of whether they were

212
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,538
elderly or on the younger side and I

213
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,579
think the most important point on this

214
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:47,340
slide is only 6% of the patient

215
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:52,230
that were 70 plus reported any confusion

216
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:54,090
or disorientation so to recap the most

217
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,850
common qualifying conditions chronic

218
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,680
pain neuropathy and cancer and in our

219
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,950
general population we see that trend up

220
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:05,309
and th see a trend down in CBD over time

221
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,810
and we implore what I call a functional

222
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,279
dosing strategy which I think is what

223
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:09,959
you were getting at earlier where we

224
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,329
always start patients on the lowest

225
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:16,440
possible dose and titrate them up slowly

226
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,759
and the idea is to as you know find the

227
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,450
smallest amount that works without

228
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,490
impairing them in any form or fashion

229
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:26,370
these products are safe and effective in

230
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,470
the elderly population and we believe

231
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,509
that the higher CBD is due to the fact

232
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,670
that the elderly population tends to

233
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:35,580
have more neuropathy from a qualifying

234
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:37,860
condition perspective last but not least

235
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,750
it's it's really exciting to have some

236
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,820
actual data to back up the idea that

237
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,200
medical cannabis could be a safe and

238
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,629
effective alternative for these patients

239
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,100
and it might even move into a first-line

240
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:49,470
position and replace over-the-counter

241
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,180
medications because it quite it quite

242
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,350
frankly has a better safety profile than

243
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,479
most of those over-the-counter

244
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,509
medications and other medications that

245
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,259
the elderly population have to take

246
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:05,590
thank you

247
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:08,769
[Applause]

248
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:13,720
excellent presentation and real data

249
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:13,720
fantastic Thank You Michelle dr. Selig

250
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:29,779
all right everyone how many people were

251
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,519
not in this room yesterday okay so maybe

252
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:33,019
about half this is just a little review

253
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,449
from some slides that we had yesterday

254
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,250
the essentials of what I think are

255
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,500
important about cannabis dosing that

256
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,340
make it different from other medications

257
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,320
so we'll just dive right in first of all

258
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,780
cannabis has an extraordinarily broad

259
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,240
safe and effective dosing range you

260
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:54,919
don't see many medications to where you

261
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,480
can have a 500 or 5,000 fold safe and

262
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:58,519
effective dosing range but literally

263
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,289
these are the doses including the

264
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,240
outliers that have seen effective in my

265
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:04,370
practice and that means someone my size

266
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,500
might need one milligram of cannabinoids

267
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,120
per day to help a condition or they

268
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,399
might do well with three and a half

269
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,560
thousand milligrams per day or maybe

270
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,449
even more and I've seen people at three

271
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,579
and a half thousand with no side effects

272
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,120
feeling great no psycho activity no

273
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,770
impairment even if it's almost all THC

274
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,889
yet researchers have really tried to

275
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:26,960
kill animals with THC and even it doses

276
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:28,639
several orders of magnitude higher than

277
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,800
what I'm seeing in my practice they've

278
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,710
failed to do so it's really impressive

279
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,899
how safe this medicine is so really

280
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,879
broad dosing range and then within this

281
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,579
broad dosing range there are non linear

282
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:42,559
dose-response effects and different

283
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,420
phases so this is an example of a

284
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,939
biphasic dose response we're in the

285
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:49,099
first phase as you increase the dose the

286
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,720
effect gets stronger but in the second

287
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,909
phase as you increase the dose the

288
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,470
effect gets weaker this is mostly due to

289
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:56,329
tolerance building but you'll notice

290
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,519
that there's an optimal dose there in

291
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,860
the middle the optimal dose is unique

292
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,240
for each person and it can change at

293
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,279
different stages of their life and

294
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,810
different stages of their healing it can

295
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,970
be a bit of a moving target but when

296
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,549
someone's at the optimal dose they do

297
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,950
not build tolerance they retain efficacy

298
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:15,799
and can do so for years or even decades

299
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,379
with great results so that's important

300
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,878
and this

301
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:21,249
shows up in the animal literature this

302
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:24,220
is an example of local motor activity in

303
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:25,989
rats if you the black bar or the dark

304
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,149
bar is their baseline local motor

305
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:30,999
activity level if you give them a tiny

306
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,739
dose of THC the activity goes down as

307
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,599
you increase the dose the activity goes

308
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:36,278
up as you increase the dose even more

309
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:38,109
the activity goes back down again and

310
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:41,288
you can see the emergence of something

311
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:44,439
called catalepsy after that peak dose

312
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:46,568
there catalepsy means remaining still in

313
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:49,448
an unusual position it's analogous to

314
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:51,208
what we call couch lock in people and if

315
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:54,908
the goal here was to reduce activity

316
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:57,008
maybe a similar goal to reducing

317
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:59,078
spasticity or anxiety or something like

318
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,028
that then you can see we would actually

319
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,438
do better using that very tiny dose

320
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:05,048
point two milligrams per kilogram

321
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:07,389
compared to the higher dose so less can

322
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:09,220
be more with cannabis it very often is

323
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:11,859
but not always here's another example of

324
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,278
less is more people with cancer chronic

325
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:17,019
pain treated with opioids started off on

326
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,778
a mix of moles which is a one to one

327
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,278
oral spray of CBD and THC and you can

328
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:22,899
see the group that got twenty milligrams

329
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,239
per day did better than the group that

330
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:28,149
got 50 and eighty-three milligrams per

331
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:30,100
day less is more and I hold back and the

332
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:34,600
placebo conversation because we're sure

333
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:37,509
at any time but it's a good one and and

334
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,220
CBD also has biphasic dose response

335
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:40,720
effects a lot of people don't observe

336
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,249
this clinically because their patients

337
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,839
can't afford the high doses that are

338
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,298
often required to demonstrate this

339
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,339
effect but here's one example of a study

340
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:50,769
on anxiety that showed that 300

341
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:52,600
milligrams work better than 900

342
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,249
milligrams and better than 100

343
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,288
milligrams there's a sweet spot with

344
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:58,449
these cannabinoids and I think as we

345
00:13:56,288 --> 00:14:00,249
design and perform clinical trials this

346
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:02,168
has to be taken into account that it's

347
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:04,418
not a one-size-fits-all dosing we need

348
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:05,769
pragmatic dosing approaches I already

349
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:08,769
told you guys this morning about how

350
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:11,229
tiny tiny bits of THC can do things in

351
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,788
mice that are quite surprising here's

352
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:14,619
just the other two references that I

353
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:17,379
mentioned this morning protect the brain

354
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:21,009
protect the heart protect the liver and

355
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,629
CBD a microgram antiemetic activity I

356
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:24,970
didn't get a chance to mention this this

357
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:27,819
morning but you'll notice the scale on

358
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,759
the x-axis is micrograms per kilogram

359
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:32,179
half

360
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,458
a microgram per kilogram of cbda in a

361
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:37,309
rat I believe was enough to reduce

362
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:39,948
nausea that is such a small dose even

363
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:42,828
for a rat that's an incredibly small

364
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:44,750
dose cbda seems to be ultra potent you

365
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:47,059
probably don't need a lot of it to go a

366
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,120
long way and it mimics many of CBDs

367
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:53,208
actions except it does not down regulate

368
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,159
the cb1 receptor so unlike CBD which is

369
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:57,169
a negative allosteric modulator at that

370
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:00,049
receptor and can counteract some of the

371
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:03,110
effects of THC CBD a would act a lot

372
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:05,088
more like CBD but without that anti THC

373
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,579
aspect which for some patients they want

374
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:09,680
the THC in the CBD and for some people

375
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:11,958
they want the full strength of THC to

376
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,458
shine through and not be limited by the

377
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:16,549
CBD yet they want to get the other

378
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:19,458
benefit CBD a is a great candidate for

379
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:21,379
that THC interestingly when it when I

380
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,609
started my practice there was no CBD

381
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,889
around we were treating everyone with

382
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,870
THC we didn't know how potent their

383
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:29,028
formulas were that didn't stop us from

384
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,649
getting great results I learned that

385
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,689
there's always almost always a

386
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:34,309
therapeutic window with THC which means

387
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,290
say this is the dose needed to treat

388
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,939
pain this is the dose that gets people

389
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:40,189
to stone to be comfortable and

390
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,319
functional and you can get inside that

391
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,910
window with precision dosing and there's

392
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:46,219
some strategies for widening that

393
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,528
therapeutic window in fact just go

394
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,209
starting low and going slow widens the

395
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:52,519
therapeutic window as you can see on the

396
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:54,109
slide because of heterogeneous tolerance

397
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,480
building in different brain regions to

398
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,240
the effects of THC make it so that we're

399
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,120
more likely to retain efficacy that of

400
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,039
the symptom relief or therapeutic

401
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,350
qualities while we build tolerance to

402
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,838
the side effects and then informs dosing

403
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,339
strategies that I have online at healer

404
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,589
calm which you guys can check out

405
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,740
there's also many bi-directional effects

406
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:18,199
in cannabis meaning it can do one thing

407
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,879
or it can do the opposite I think THC

408
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:21,289
overdose is the best example of that

409
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,990
which is characterized by nausea

410
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:26,328
vomiting diarrhea twitching muscle

411
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,399
spasms pain confusion anxiety at the

412
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:29,899
right dose of THC it can treat all of

413
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,208
those things that the wrong dose that

414
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:34,009
can cause all of those things and I just

415
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:37,879
need to say one last thing here about

416
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:39,740
dosing yeah out of my great respect -

417
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,210
Caroline McCallum and her co-author

418
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,830
Ethan Russo

419
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,889
who ready to wrote a great paper on

420
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:49,100
dosing in which they warmly acknowledged

421
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:51,319
me but I there's just a saying in that

422
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,300
paper that I think the wording needs a

423
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,190
little bit of tweaking if I may and it's

424
00:16:53,299 --> 00:17:00,109
been quoted another research I've seen

425
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:02,750
it's start low go slow and stay low when

426
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,039
actually the real saying is in my

427
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,089
opinion from what I learned in in my

428
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:10,909
practice is start low go slow and don't

429
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,949
be afraid to go all the way that's

430
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,960
really what it comes down to because

431
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,390
some people do well on extraordinarily

432
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,269
high doses we don't know that until we

433
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,610
try but don't stay low if someone's not

434
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:24,589
responding to a low dose please titrate

435
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:26,029
up to thousands of milligrams if they

436
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,929
need it and if they can afford it

437
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:33,989
sometimes that works as well thank you

438
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,989
[Applause]

439
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,750
so two really prominent things come out

440
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,600
of this number one is the idea of for

441
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,640
Mises doctors who like called it

442
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,279
biphasic also known as hormetic and

443
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,320
these hormetic effects are classic

444
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:51,019
throughout all the biological Kingdom

445
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,789
with almost every substance so keep in

446
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:55,190
mind if you're a clinician and you don't

447
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:57,319
know about biphasic dosing or hormesis

448
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,330
look it up because it's really rather

449
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:04,069
profound the other thing that comes out

450
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:07,699
and by the way until about 1940 when the

451
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:10,309
homeopaths jumped on the idea of poor

452
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,470
Mises which is this idea that a low dose

453
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:15,049
could have an effect but a high dose

454
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:18,799
could be toxic there were multiple

455
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:20,509
journals with the theme of hormesis when

456
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,220
the homeopaths jumped on board of that

457
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:24,500
to try to explain scientifically why

458
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,759
their stuff worked all the journals went

459
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,819
out of business within about three or

460
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,920
four years that's science being killed

461
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:32,149
by politics

462
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,350
well now the other thing that doctor

463
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,240
Sulak brought up rather well is

464
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,529
inter-individual variability and I think

465
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,720
most of us know in this room at this

466
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:40,069
point that the degree of inter

467
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,750
individual variability in the

468
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:44,119
endocannabinoid system is really rather

469
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,769
profound so let's keep that in mind and

470
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,769
let's to hand it over to dr. McCollum

471
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,720
[Applause]

472
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,009
hi everyone it's so great to be here and

473
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,710
we're having such a lovely discussion

474
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,879
I'm sure there's gonna be some overlap

475
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:04,329
just want to mention before I get going

476
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,040
I've got my Twitter handle on the screen

477
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:07,750
here and there's a number of us in the

478
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,000
audience that are quite active and

479
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,710
Bonnie's got a great Instagram page and

480
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,809
trying to get others involved dustin's

481
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,850
and Tom Poland and just to really get

482
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:18,789
the conversation going and the movement

483
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:20,250
that we need to have about having good

484
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:23,649
evidence out there and talking

485
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,059
rationally about this medicine so just a

486
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,380
couple disclosures I work with a number

487
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,000
of different groups some of them are

488
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,890
cannabis related groups some of them are

489
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,609
nonprofits so just to mention those

490
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:35,440
disclosures before I get started so dr.

491
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:37,419
Russo myself we wrote this paper as

492
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,220
Dustin kindly pointed out and I'd love

493
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,509
to have a chat about that in the Q&amp;A

494
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,460
because I think that's a really great

495
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:44,259
point what you've mentioned and there it

496
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,819
might need some qualifiers but just

497
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:47,319
enough to say that we really do need to

498
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:49,450
have good clinical practice when we're

499
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,950
working with cannabis and be discerning

500
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,420
that it isn't for everyone and we need

501
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,730
to make sure that we're screening our

502
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,140
patients appropriately so just some

503
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,210
questions I know we're talking about

504
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,310
dosing here but I just have to mention

505
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,019
these things before I dive into the

506
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,599
dosing these are questions that I

507
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:06,039
frequently ask myself before I authorize

508
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,230
cannabis for a patient

509
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,940
so is there supporting evidence for this

510
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,160
patient and if there isn't let's have a

511
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,080
conversation about it let's weigh the

512
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,450
the pros and cons with this medication

513
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,909
just like every other medication we do

514
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,920
in medicine has this patient tried other

515
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,170
things it is kind of worth documenting

516
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,570
if they have especially for medical

517
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,330
legal purposes honestly so I like to

518
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:30,189
write this down if I can and then what

519
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:32,109
are the patient's expectations and

520
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,059
talking about placebo effect and other

521
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:36,159
topics of this nature I think are

522
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:37,809
important does this patient have any

523
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,450
reasons why we wouldn't use cannabis

524
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:42,609
being very mindful of schizophrenia and

525
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,830
other conditions we need to be careful

526
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:46,809
with THC it doesn't mean we can't use it

527
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:48,789
but having a discussion around that and

528
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:51,460
then what are the patient's risk for

529
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,779
cannabis use disorder what are the

530
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,910
benefits versus the risk like I

531
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:56,019
mentioned and how do we actually dose

532
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,480
cannabis which is what we're going to

533
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:00,819
dive into and also considering when we

534
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,538
can tape or other medications once for

535
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:03,970
seeing symptom

536
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:05,288
provement so again this is the paper and

537
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,659
it's available for free for download

538
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:10,210
it's also on my website so please check

539
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:12,220
it out and just to touch a little bit on

540
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,989
roots administration because we're when

541
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,970
we're talking about a DOS and we're

542
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:17,229
talking about milligrams that's really

543
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,389
an edible that we're frequently

544
00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:21,100
referring to but then when you're

545
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:23,498
inhaling cannabis the dose can be a

546
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:24,759
little bit more complicated so in the

547
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:26,409
interest of time I won't go through all

548
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,659
of these different routes but just

549
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:30,909
enough to say there are pros and cons to

550
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,710
different routes we will use if it's an

551
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:34,869
acute symptom we're gonna want to inhale

552
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:38,649
cannabis probably if it's a chronic

553
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:40,749
symptoms can be more helpful and be

554
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:42,699
mindful of vaporization and Dustin

555
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:44,940
speaks a lot to this point as well so

556
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,460
first talking about how we can use

557
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:51,399
cannabis in an inhaled format using the

558
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,769
lowest dose possible to get benefit so

559
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:56,138
again possibly increasing the dose until

560
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:58,149
we see that response so again starting

561
00:21:56,138 --> 00:22:00,219
with one inhalation and waiting 10

562
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:02,168
minutes and checking out how you feel

563
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,509
and what symptoms are going on for you

564
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:06,369
and then increasing from there and then

565
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:08,259
when you add up all those inhalations

566
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:10,808
that may become your baseline dose

567
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:12,848
however that dose can change for

568
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:14,618
different products so if you have a 20%

569
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:16,148
THC product that's gonna have a

570
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:18,308
different number of inhalations and a

571
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:20,678
10% so just keeping that in mind and

572
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:23,378
also if you go on vacation and stop

573
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,298
using cannabis and restart again with

574
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:27,548
teach you may need to go back down to a

575
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:29,829
lower previous dose just in case you've

576
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:31,929
lost some of your tolerance there and so

577
00:22:29,829 --> 00:22:34,269
basically really just being mindful of

578
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:36,369
how you use it and especially with the

579
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,950
vaporizer I find it easier for patients

580
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:39,728
to put a small amount in and to add more

581
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,369
if they need it

582
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:43,778
versus rolling a joint frequently people

583
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:45,548
will smoke the whole joint when they may

584
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:48,128
not really need it all depending on

585
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:50,999
their dose and just to mention the

586
00:22:48,128 --> 00:22:53,498
entourage effect so this has been dr.

587
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:54,999
sorry dr. Russo is very big into this so

588
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:58,239
it is a thing and it's important to be

589
00:22:54,999 --> 00:23:00,569
mindful that CBD in addition to THC can

590
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:02,460
allow us to go to a higher dose of THC

591
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:05,079
them might have been previously

592
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,700
tolerated so here are some doses that I

593
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,769
just mentioned that I'm drawing from the

594
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,929
paper again starting with about 5

595
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:13,419
milligrams to 10 milligrams twice a day

596
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:15,759
for CBD I find that to be effective for

597
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:18,250
my patients I have actually very few pay

598
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,589
that do go a whole lot higher than 50 to

599
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,630
100 milligrams but I don't see as much

600
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:26,169
oncology and there are some other

601
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:28,660
subcategories such as seizures and so

602
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,279
forth that may require higher doses so

603
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,410
again I think that it's really

604
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,629
interesting this biphasic discussion and

605
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,310
we really don't know each person like

606
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,900
each individual how they will respond

607
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:40,480
and what dose would be helpful for them

608
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,820
but again the higher you go the more

609
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,220
costly this medication can be so be

610
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:47,139
mindful and having a patient record

611
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,730
their outcomes is really helpful because

612
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,140
they may hit a point where they're

613
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,120
spending more money and they're getting

614
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,550
no more benefit so really getting them

615
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:56,559
to check in on that and then 40g I

616
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:57,669
usually start around 1 milligram to 2

617
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,859
point 5 milligrams

618
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,320
I always start at bedtime if they have

619
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:04,209
any issues with sleep especially because

620
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,460
then we can use it as a two-for-one I

621
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,319
have a number of patients that I

622
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,210
actually help them sleep in the daytime

623
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,399
they don't need any cannabis and I think

624
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,009
that this is a really opportunity window

625
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,170
to use THC because if they're driving a

626
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:18,519
car or you know they've got kids and

627
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,980
they don't want to be under the

628
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,359
influence of THC even a low dose it

629
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,349
would be great if we didn't have to go

630
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:26,439
there

631
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:28,119
so again optimizing for THC a CBD a and

632
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,820
other cannabinoids I think could be very

633
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:33,489
helpful and so just some general dosing

634
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:35,589
tips these are kind of a little bit more

635
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,799
specific and maybe a bit more advanced

636
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:40,179
depending on the conversation but a lot

637
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,519
of the times these are points that I go

638
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,980
over and with different individuals

639
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,230
depending on what their experience of

640
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,150
cannabis has already been so basically

641
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,890
patients get tolerance to the side

642
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,019
effects of cannabis and in my experience

643
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,990
they don't necessarily get tolerance to

644
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:57,369
the benefits so what I mean by that is I

645
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,380
know that we just heard from the first

646
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:01,959
talk that the dose was increasing and

647
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,580
over time with THC but most of my

648
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,710
patients actually plateau out at a

649
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:08,199
certain dose and they're not increasing

650
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,360
indefinitely something they do report is

651
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,880
having to rotate a strain so they may

652
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:14,319
feel like it's may not be working quite

653
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,090
as well but if they try a different

654
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,609
flower that may have a similar

655
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:21,759
concentration or a percentage that they

656
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:23,319
do find it can help them kind of bridge

657
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,220
that gap so that they aren't increasing

658
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,659
the dosing

659
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,789
but again this requires a lot of

660
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,259
Education and making sure the patient

661
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:31,899
isn't just on their own

662
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:34,269
increasing up to five grams a day or 10

663
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,460
grams a day where I have seen that in

664
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:38,349
some cases and from our studies

665
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,230
especially dr. ware who's one of our

666
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:43,389
Canadian experts 1 2 3 grams a day of

667
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,099
dried product is largely what the

668
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,530
medical cannabis patients were using in

669
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:51,579
his study and over 90% of patients will

670
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:53,430
only use between 0.5 and 1.5 grams for

671
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:55,480
medical purposes so keeping that in mind

672
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,009
so it's also important to mention

673
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,779
there's terpenes and other minor

674
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:01,240
cannabinoids that can definitely make a

675
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:03,730
difference I've had some patients try 20

676
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,890
different plants and it may be the you

677
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,289
know the 18th or the 20th that that do

678
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,300
help them with different symptoms so

679
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:12,369
those patients are quite persistent and

680
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:13,659
adamant but at some point we do just

681
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:15,339
need to make sure that they're actually

682
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,630
getting the outcomes that they're

683
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:18,519
looking for

684
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,340
I don't ever recommend shatter or dabs

685
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,019
for medical purposes and even for

686
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:24,730
recreational purposes I think we need to

687
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:26,139
be very mindful especially with some of

688
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,910
the health concerns that are coming out

689
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,030
and especially with them regulated

690
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:33,400
products and being mindful also of

691
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:35,289
Tolerance there is an opportunity to

692
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,050
consider a washout for some patients and

693
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:40,180
that may be appropriate and CVD can help

694
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:42,639
us wash out a patient when they are

695
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,950
getting up to a higher dose of THC where

696
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,620
they may not be comfortable so keeping

697
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,809
this in mind and then also mention there

698
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:51,969
are some of these low risk use

699
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:54,359
guidelines that I think are notable and

700
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:57,100
a lot of them make a lot of sense

701
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:59,500
starting low avoiding high percentages

702
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:01,179
if we don't need it which I don't

703
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,559
totally agree I think that there's some

704
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,960
math here that they're not understanding

705
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,629
you just use less of a more concentrated

706
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,059
product it doesn't mean you can't use a

707
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,400
higher percentage product and being

708
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:15,609
careful of age of onset and frequency of

709
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,410
use if not necessary and then monitoring

710
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:20,079
important just to say that it does need

711
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:23,980
to happen it's important if possible to

712
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:26,379
capture questionnaire data so anxiety

713
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,360
depression pain if you're able to get

714
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,430
questionnaire data from your patients it

715
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:32,619
can be very useful both for you and for

716
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:34,450
them but really focusing on their

717
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:36,399
function are they able to walk to the

718
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,130
mailbox are they able to hold their

719
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,140
child sometimes the numbers don't change

720
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,700
but they are living better

721
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,770
they do feel that the quality of life

722
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,420
has improved so I definitely think that

723
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:47,950
that's important to note and there are

724
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,710
some apps out there that can be really

725
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:53,110
helpful with this as well so in my last

726
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,759
minute there are some dosing strategies

727
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:57,189
that just to summarize here on this

728
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,140
slide so sometimes use the oil over

729
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,870
vaporization can be more helpful for

730
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:05,340
chronic conditions considering CVD over

731
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:08,548
THC really doing a good job on education

732
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:11,558
switching from smoking to vaporization

733
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:14,910
using I have here using the lowest dose

734
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:17,710
of THC but but that is working for them

735
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,130
and not focusing on percentages and so

736
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,470
forth

737
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,900
and then the last few slides so this is

738
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,789
my overall I guess my approach to how I

739
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,950
treat a patient the first question I

740
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:28,418
asked is at daytime or nighttime symptom

741
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,340
why would I treat the day if I can

742
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:32,470
really get away with nighttime only so

743
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:34,808
sometimes that would mean obviously THC

744
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,360
at night CBD for the daytime a lot of

745
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:39,730
the time especially for my patients who

746
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,928
are driving and working they don't

747
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,048
necessarily always feel comfortable

748
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:46,960
using THC is an acute symptom or chronic

749
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:49,359
symptom if it's acute vaporization as

750
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,490
I've mentioned the pathophysiology if

751
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:54,490
it's largely inflammation CBD may be a

752
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:57,130
really good option for them there are a

753
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,710
couple of exceptions to the neurological

754
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,620
point that I've made here if they have

755
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,929
psychosis for example or in Pediatrics I

756
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:07,089
may just be more mindful of using THC

757
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:08,710
for neurological condition however I

758
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:12,159
definitely do use teve seeing these

759
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:14,048
patients but trying to optimize CBD

760
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,480
potentially first and then special

761
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:18,369
populations so the elderly I have

762
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,230
patients with Parkinson's that have

763
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:23,019
blood pressures resting blood pressures

764
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,480
of 70 over 40 and so they can be very

765
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:28,029
sensitive to THC so I frequently start

766
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,058
lower with them and then the last piece

767
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:33,160
here I try not to do any drug other

768
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:34,808
prescription changes when I initiate

769
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,548
cannabis because there's just too many

770
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:38,079
things going on and it's hard to tease

771
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:40,058
out what the side effect could be due to

772
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,678
so I'd like to help them feel better

773
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:44,829
first and then pull away from their

774
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,700
prescription medications and that's it

775
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:47,699
thank you

776
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,350
[Applause]

777
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:59,769
okay so there you have it straight out

778
00:29:56,349 --> 00:30:01,000
of the doctor's mouth one of the things

779
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:03,089
I want to put forward how many people

780
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,940
are here from industry

781
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:08,470
okay so here's in many of you may be

782
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,929
aware of this already but there are

783
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:15,569
people out there suggesting that the

784
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:17,440
dosing that are as on CBD products which

785
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:19,658
well let me just talk about a recent

786
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,519
review that just came out a 20-19 review

787
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:24,070
came out it basically said anything

788
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:28,028
under about 100 milligrams of CBD a day

789
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:29,678
wasn't really doing much so those of you

790
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:31,538
from industry obviously you know we're

791
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,460
seeing doses like five milligrams ten

792
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,048
milligrams a couple times a day and so

793
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:39,970
you've got people on the science side

794
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:43,658
saying it's placebo which I would say is

795
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,940
possible look you need mystique to have

796
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:48,880
placebo you need reputation to have

797
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:52,330
placebo you've got both of those right

798
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,299
and you need price value to have placebo

799
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:56,259
you've got all three of those so

800
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,808
definitely there is probably some

801
00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:00,099
placebo going on now I may get some

802
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:02,109
tomatoes thrown at me but there's almost

803
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:03,519
certainly some placebo going on when

804
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:04,898
you're taking something that's got such

805
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,058
a reputation around it and it was

806
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:08,979
expensive right and there's it's

807
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:11,109
mystical because it comes from this

808
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,329
forbidden plant there's definitely gonna

809
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:15,788
be that effect however having said that

810
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,769
you've just heard from a couple of Doc's

811
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:20,769
here that say that five milligrams ten

812
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:22,629
milligrams an average mean dose of 14

813
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:24,398
milligrams I think what CBD actually

814
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,500
does something so I'd like to just throw

815
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:33,609
it out to our panel here to comment on

816
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:36,190
that so I mostly work with children but

817
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:39,038
I've also worked with adults now for 11

818
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:43,899
years and what I find is that there is

819
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:46,269
no number it can be as low as four

820
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:48,369
milligrams or as high as 400 and I'll

821
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:51,069
just share with you two clinical

822
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:54,639
experiences I had one little boy was

823
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:56,408
taking four milligrams when they came to

824
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,288
see me the parents had already started

825
00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:00,970
and when they told me it was four

826
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:03,190
milligrams I kind of looked the skew and

827
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:05,860
as a little boy with autism but the

828
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,980
teacher who did not know he was on that

829
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:10,449
four milligrams before it came in

830
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,278
actually pulled the mother aside and

831
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,259
commented what are you giving your child

832
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:17,859
because he's a completely different

833
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:19,359
child and as I when they came to see me

834
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:20,979
I thought four milligrams I don't give

835
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,629
anybody four milligrams at such a low

836
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,370
dose but usually I'm taking care of very

837
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,559
ill people who need much higher doses

838
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:28,329
and so I said well why don't we just

839
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,829
titrate up and see if there's any more

840
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:32,589
benefit because they were already seeing

841
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:35,319
more event benefits at four he did not

842
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:37,480
tolerate seven milligrams or ten

843
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,220
milligrams it actually gave him an

844
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,730
opposite effect so for that particular

845
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:45,490
child it was very effective at a very

846
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,679
small dose which is great it won't cost

847
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,599
them a fortune that's terrific

848
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,950
I don't think that's a placebo because

849
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,439
that little boy did not know what he was

850
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:55,360
getting on the other hand I had another

851
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,038
little boy that came in with severe

852
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,259
aggression self injurious behavior

853
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,849
biting the parents the dad showed me

854
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:03,099
pictures of all the bruises on

855
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:05,469
everybody's bodies and this little boy

856
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:07,359
they had started off giving him prior to

857
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,710
coming to see me because they were had

858
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,250
been waiting a little while for the

859
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,730
appointment

860
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:14,769
they started with CBD and they went up

861
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:17,200
to about a hundred milligrams didn't see

862
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:19,259
anything then they gave THC a ran it up

863
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,720
they didn't see anything they gave him

864
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:24,519
THC and I told this story yesterday they

865
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,200
gave him up to 15 milligrams they had

866
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,369
heard that was a high dose and so they

867
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,720
didn't want to give any more but it

868
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:30,278
didn't do anything for him and by the

869
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,230
way that dad thought the bottle was bad

870
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:35,980
so he took 15 milligrams and slept for

871
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,750
two days so wasn't the bottle and it

872
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,558
turned out that this little boy needed

873
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:45,009
400 milligrams twice a day of CBD in

874
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:47,710
order to help his autism and his

875
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:50,888
aggression was gone at 400 milligrams

876
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,769
twice a day that's very expensive but

877
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:56,888
notice that here I have two kids four

878
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:59,619
milligrams 400 milligrams the same

879
00:33:56,888 --> 00:34:02,019
checkbox for diagnosis so there's just a

880
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:03,449
very wide range and what I tell families

881
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:05,700
is if you don't see any

882
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,820
think as long as it's not negative if

883
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,639
you see no change you haven't found the

884
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,899
dose yet right you have to escalate and

885
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,280
then a lot of people don't want to do

886
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:15,449
that on their own and I do highly

887
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,700
recommend that all children are

888
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:19,588
medically supervised during this but if

889
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:21,449
you don't if you see a negative effect

890
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:23,009
then obviously you maybe have gone too

891
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,569
high and maybe that is not the right

892
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,280
chemo bar the right product the right

893
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:30,450
strain and maybe try something else

894
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,550
within that realm super so you have a

895
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,989
really excellent example here actually

896
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,820
put a couple but that was a great

897
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:39,000
example of physiological dosing right

898
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:43,800
finding that dose imagine if we did that

899
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:50,760
with all the drugs anybody else comment

900
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:52,200
on that Michelle to add to that point

901
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,849
about the dosing being incredibly

902
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,588
personal one of the other things we've

903
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:57,480
found in our database is that we have a

904
00:34:55,588 --> 00:35:00,088
group of patients that have extremely

905
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,760
high daily dose requirements and another

906
00:35:00,088 --> 00:35:04,949
group that is extremely low they have

907
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,200
the same qualifying conditions and they

908
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:09,899
have based on the surveys we give them

909
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,039
the same satisfaction with therapy so

910
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,530
one of the things we're doing right now

911
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,838
is trying to understand the metabolic

912
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,700
pathways and the metabolism associated

913
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:20,099
with that to see if there's certain

914
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:23,338
isoforms in this at 450 system and all

915
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:25,170
those other pharmacologic pathways that

916
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:27,539
that might give us a little anxiety from

917
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,460
education a long time ago but to try to

918
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:30,989
understand if that metabolism is

919
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,119
significantly different and can we use

920
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:35,879
that information to predict that

921
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,920
starting dose because if we can then we

922
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,568
can save these patients money in the

923
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,220
long run by being able to start them on

924
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:47,250
the right dose or at least closer to

925
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:50,489
that right dose from the beginning yeah

926
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,108
so one last thing to add in Israel

927
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:54,118
they're doing some clinical trials on

928
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,650
children with autism they're also

929
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,660
measuring an and amide levels

930
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,970
endocannabinoids and these children then

931
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:02,670
there was a correlation that the more

932
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:05,039
deficient it seemed to correlate with

933
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,780
more severe symptoms which makes sense

934
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,539
right the more Ananda my deficient you

935
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:13,170
are the more excited toxicity you may

936
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:16,039
have our own excite-ation so if somebody

937
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,869
is highly in that category let's say

938
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:19,489
severe symptoms it's quite possible

939
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:22,429
they're more endocannabinoid deficient

940
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:25,039
this is why having objective lab testing

941
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:27,279
either receptor status and and amide

942
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,929
levels that would be extremely helpful

943
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,090
to be able to do that

944
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:33,829
the problem is is that if you wanted to

945
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,390
do right now I don't believe really

946
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:39,349
commercially the tests are available

947
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:40,789
commercially but I expect that I don't

948
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:42,920
know if insurance would cover those

949
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:45,289
tests and then to add that cost on top

950
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,480
of everything but I do think that we

951
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:50,389
might get to a point where if we could

952
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,800
measure this in patients and we have an

953
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:55,699
indication and maybe we could

954
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,230
potentially get insurance to cover a nan

955
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:58,939
de Mai deficiency and I always tell

956
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,619
people if you're freaked out by THD

957
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:09,200
change the name to an and amide

958
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:11,029
replacement right lovely so let's take a

959
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,769
step back and talk about plant medicines

960
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,620
for a second here right because plant

961
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:17,599
medicines are complex in fact what we're

962
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:19,549
doing whether it's cannabis or other

963
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,619
medicinal plants as we're using the most

964
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:24,590
complex pharmacology there isn't a

965
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:27,230
planet however it's also evolutionarily

966
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:28,930
proven that's what we've always known it

967
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:31,250
wasn't until I heard it number today

968
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:33,289
1897 that there were ice Flitz out there

969
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,360
that people could take his drugs now

970
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:38,090
with that in mind isolates have this

971
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,579
idea of one drug one disease or a single

972
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:43,039
target right now there's a side and

973
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:44,929
Pharma about dirty drugs that a drug

974
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,429
that hits more than one target is it

975
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:49,519
dirty drug now that tells you everything

976
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:53,529
about the the pharma mentality right

977
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:55,969
well wait medicinal plants work is by

978
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:59,420
biochemical convergence multiple targets

979
00:37:55,969 --> 00:38:02,929
hitting different sites or one tart one

980
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,599
compound hitting multiple targets

981
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:07,009
hitting one site right so you've got

982
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,900
both of those things going on so you

983
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,000
have this biochemical convergence on an

984
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,579
outcome not necessarily just one

985
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,590
receptor one enzyme which have also got

986
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:18,289
pharmacokinetic potentiation from the

987
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:20,539
other compounds in there now a lot of

988
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:23,300
the isolate research a lot of the

989
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:26,449
research on CBD and some of it on THC

990
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,470
has really been based on isolates so one

991
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:29,419
of the reasons we may be seeing

992
00:38:27,469 --> 00:38:34,308
differences in

993
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:37,579
and the dosing with THC CBD real-world

994
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:39,769
clinic versus the research is based on

995
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:41,298
this idea of Network pharmacology that

996
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:45,530
we're hitting multiple we're treating a

997
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:48,019
body as a network and massaging multiple

998
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:51,500
nodes at once rather than run single

999
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:53,179
target so with that in mind let me throw

1000
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,579
a question out to our panel and that

1001
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:58,179
question would be in terms of quality

1002
00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:00,619
control of product and things that are

1003
00:38:58,179 --> 00:39:02,389
full spectrum broad spectrum complete

1004
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:06,470
spectrum and I've heard isolate called

1005
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:09,469
full spectrum before how do you how do

1006
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:11,629
you guys as clinicians negotiate the

1007
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:17,779
different products and the variability

1008
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:20,088
in those products and dos well I think

1009
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,829
one thing that dr. McAllen pointed out

1010
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:24,139
which I've seen over and over again

1011
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:26,210
through the years and I'm sure dr.

1012
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:28,068
Goldstein has also is that people do

1013
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,740
well with variability in their

1014
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:33,079
medication so while the pharmaceutical

1015
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:34,789
industry and the medical system likes to

1016
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,650
really standardize things and keep them

1017
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,389
consistent from one month to the next I

1018
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,750
think there's an advantage in cannabis

1019
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:43,519
to having actually change over time so

1020
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,659
that that's one comment and just

1021
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,230
something I want to repeat that I

1022
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:51,108
learned from you Kevin is the term full

1023
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,760
spectrum I believe refers to taking the

1024
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:54,619
flower and putting it in your mouth and

1025
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,660
I don't think that there's any other

1026
00:39:54,619 --> 00:40:00,530
full spectrum that exists you can have

1027
00:39:56,659 --> 00:40:02,149
very close to full spectrum so you know

1028
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,280
thank you for the applause I think some

1029
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,019
of you recognize this like we're as an

1030
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,269
industry doing our best to make very

1031
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:09,739
broad spectrum medications a lot of us

1032
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:11,599
recognize that as many of those

1033
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:13,909
compounds as we can get in there that's

1034
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,740
gonna be helpful but let's not call it

1035
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:18,048
full spectrum because that that's a

1036
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:19,338
misnomer let's be honest I think one of

1037
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:22,009
the big problems with the opioid

1038
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:23,808
epidemic was this dishonesty about what

1039
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,880
it could do and how safe it was and what

1040
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:27,680
it was like that's not even tiptoe near

1041
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,039
that with cannabis let's be extremely

1042
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:33,039
honest and transparent if we can

1043
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:33,039
actually

1044
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:39,318
and I mean another good analogy to to

1045
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:40,999
that concept and that those thoughts on

1046
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:43,009
broad spectrum or full spectrum whatever

1047
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:44,778
you you'd like to use is looking at

1048
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:46,818
novel owned for example I have patients

1049
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:49,219
that can't afford cannabis so sometimes

1050
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:51,528
what I do is use nav alone as the cheat

1051
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:53,838
she kind of substitutes so to speak even

1052
00:40:51,528 --> 00:40:55,759
though it's not for sleep at time

1053
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,978
perhaps and then CBD in the daytime and

1054
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:59,659
then a number of them it may not work or

1055
00:40:57,978 --> 00:41:02,149
they have very serious severe side

1056
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:04,129
effects and for some at me last you know

1057
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,930
10 hours or longer the side effects

1058
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,548
which isn't great for a number of my

1059
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:10,969
patients especially when they're elderly

1060
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:13,248
and the lowest dose is 2.5 sorry 0.25

1061
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:15,169
milligrams but then when we try cannabis

1062
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:17,598
and we do a lower dose they get response

1063
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,579
so I think you know looking at just THC

1064
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,099
versus THC and the company it keeps

1065
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:24,109
that's a good example of showing that

1066
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:25,940
there is something more to it and then

1067
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:28,190
also something that I know Dustin you've

1068
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,630
spoken about this before is the idea

1069
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,759
that you may not always need this

1070
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:33,650
medicine and I can think of one of my

1071
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:36,380
professional patients she's done

1072
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:38,028
everything I've ever told her to do and

1073
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,039
it's taken us a few years but right now

1074
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:42,619
she doesn't use cannabis so she was a

1075
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:44,390
lawyer she was very sick we did

1076
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:46,670
everything for cannabis because she

1077
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:50,179
wanted to and she's got kids and very

1078
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:52,039
you know kind of fixed in the way she

1079
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:53,538
was thinking about cannabis and we

1080
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:55,579
actually did make a lot of gains with

1081
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:57,349
cannabis and unfortunately for her she

1082
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:00,499
had to use more THC than she wanted to

1083
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:02,229
she wanted to just do CBD and just do

1084
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:04,939
nav alone before that and very much

1085
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:07,338
regimented and then when she started

1086
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:10,400
doing mindfulness courses learning about

1087
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:12,469
nutrition doing some yoga so really this

1088
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,329
neuroplasticity and she was able to come

1089
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:16,579
to classes with the help of the medicine

1090
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:18,769
because before she was bedridden with

1091
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,900
her chronic fatigue and her fibromyalgia

1092
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:22,968
so it actually got her to a place where

1093
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,309
she could do the hard work and actually

1094
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:27,259
now she uses very little if any she's

1095
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,789
like maybe just as needed so yeah I

1096
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:31,608
think that those are great examples of

1097
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:33,319
how it can be really an adjunct and

1098
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:35,858
something like your tonics that that

1099
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:38,478
analogy is today it's very very helpful

1100
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:39,978
great and I just want to point out

1101
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:41,718
something this idea of plasticity I

1102
00:42:39,978 --> 00:42:43,788
think is really key and we we talk about

1103
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:45,610
neural plasticity a lot but I'd like to

1104
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:46,760
suggest that there's actually a

1105
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,610
[Music]

1106
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,470
Mooka logical or a physiological

1107
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:56,300
plasticity but that would be based on

1108
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:59,029
tweaking a lot of different sites right

1109
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:02,360
a lot of different targets as we say in

1110
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:04,850
pharma not just taking one isolate so

1111
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,680
could it be that in fact five million

1112
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:09,679
years of evolution right in terms of

1113
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:12,279
putting complex plants in our mouth and

1114
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:16,279
chewing them could that be that that is

1115
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:19,400
maybe the key way to stimulate the

1116
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,650
system towards a healing response rather

1117
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,440
than one isolate and isolate gives us

1118
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:26,059
the illusion of control but due to inner

1119
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,950
individual variability I'm going to say

1120
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:29,360
to you guys with 80 to 100 thousand

1121
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:31,519
people dying from properly prescribed

1122
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,090
medications every year to new to nature

1123
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:40,909
drugs I don't think we have control

1124
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:42,620
right so great commentary okay so

1125
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:46,099
another another huge one that I'm

1126
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:47,150
finding in effect My partner and I it's

1127
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:47,889
interesting to watch the difference

1128
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,360
between us

1129
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:58,429
can you speak to gender differences in

1130
00:43:50,360 --> 00:44:00,110
terms of dosing and effects sure you

1131
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:03,199
know there's a lot of inter individual

1132
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:05,570
variability and so it's big confounder

1133
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,219
and gender differences because it's hard

1134
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,559
to tease out just every person is so

1135
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:11,119
different but the only clear gender

1136
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,900
difference that I've observed in my

1137
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,969
practice has to do with older women who

1138
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,980
are using opioids and have been on them

1139
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:21,859
for a long period of time and they seem

1140
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,840
less likely to experience the THC based

1141
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:26,090
opioid pretension of analgesia

1142
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,250
potentiation of analgesia so like most

1143
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:30,170
patients that are on opioids we give

1144
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,940
them some THC once they get up to the

1145
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,230
stove's to opioids feel too strong and

1146
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,650
they start breaking them in half that's

1147
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:40,159
many many of the patients but I have had

1148
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:42,769
several older women patients on opioids

1149
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,659
that have not had that response and even

1150
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:47,000
some that aren't on opioids were THC

1151
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:49,039
just doesn't seem to work as well as an

1152
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,320
analgesic where that therapeutic window

1153
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,449
that I described before is does not

1154
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,010
exist and they start getting intolerable

1155
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:58,279
psychoactive effects before they

1156
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:59,609
experience the analgesia and that's not

1157
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,259
all of them that's

1158
00:44:59,608 --> 00:45:04,739
far from all of them that's just a

1159
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:06,239
little bit of a trend I've observed yeah

1160
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:09,059
I've got a husband and wife couple

1161
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:12,119
similar in age mid forties and he can't

1162
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:14,420
tolerate any THC whatsoever for he uses

1163
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:17,039
it for anxiety and his wife has

1164
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,940
migraines and she can tolerate you know

1165
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:22,859
a good dose of THC and actually one

1166
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,170
thing she mentioned to me she's very

1167
00:45:22,858 --> 00:45:26,818
much into practicing yoga she said well

1168
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:29,579
I drank a full liter of lemon water

1169
00:45:26,818 --> 00:45:31,108
before I start my day and so Ethan I

1170
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:33,109
know you know writes quite a bit about

1171
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:36,449
you know lemon and these antidotes and

1172
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:38,248
potentially being able to tame THC and

1173
00:45:36,449 --> 00:45:39,538
the terpenes so I don't really know if

1174
00:45:38,248 --> 00:45:41,909
that has to do with her ability to

1175
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:43,950
tolerate THC but he can't tolerate any

1176
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:47,899
so I just feel like it's all over the

1177
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:52,199
map like it's really hard to tell Bonnie

1178
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:54,180
sure you know and I will just comment

1179
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:55,889
that some of the data which you showed

1180
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:57,358
yesterday Bonnie out of Israel did show

1181
00:45:55,889 --> 00:46:01,170
a sex difference response to an autistic

1182
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:03,208
children with autistic spectrum disorder

1183
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:06,568
in Israel and the boys were more likely

1184
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:08,698
to respond to a CBD dominant preparation

1185
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:10,768
for severe behaviors in autism even

1186
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:14,009
though the girls did respond the boys

1187
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:16,258
responded better okay so another another

1188
00:46:14,009 --> 00:46:18,358
topic to touch on is this idea of micro

1189
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:20,759
dosing so I've heard people say they

1190
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:23,190
can't stand the idea of this term being

1191
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:26,039
used but we're talking about micro

1192
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:29,639
dosing with psilocybin now with DMT with

1193
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:32,489
THC with CBD even in fact you've seen

1194
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:34,558
some data here today that micro dosing

1195
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:39,349
if that's what you want to call it with

1196
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:43,259
CBD or THC a did you show the THC a via

1197
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:45,059
that this makes a huge difference in in

1198
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:48,920
outcomes so I just want to throw the

1199
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:51,719
micro dosing concept out to you guys I

1200
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,579
think you know we don't have to be real

1201
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:55,619
strict with our terminology but it is a

1202
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:57,869
bit of a misnomer I think traditionally

1203
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:00,059
micro dosing refers to microgram doses

1204
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:01,619
of a substance now we're using a micro

1205
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:03,930
like there's some normal dosing and now

1206
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,940
we're like one level below that but

1207
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:07,399
essentially I think the way it's being

1208
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,220
used the most and it's

1209
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,200
effectively uses to describe typically a

1210
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:14,179
dose of THC that does not produce

1211
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,098
psychoactive effects but still promotes

1212
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:18,639
some type of a health benefit whether

1213
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:21,349
that symptom relief or stress resilience

1214
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:23,210
improvement and that's that's the micro

1215
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:25,099
dose can we use cannabis in a way that

1216
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:28,400
makes us slightly more flexible maybe a

1217
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:29,778
little bit happier or easier to kind of

1218
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,329
roll with the punches kind of thing

1219
00:47:29,778 --> 00:47:34,250
without getting high and and that's

1220
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:35,720
there and while it's doing that what

1221
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,460
else is it doing like I mentioned this

1222
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:39,588
morning protecting us should we have a

1223
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,568
heart attack a brain injury liver injury

1224
00:47:39,588 --> 00:47:45,170
and so forth so maybe there's something

1225
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:48,199
to that I'm just gonna make a comment

1226
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:50,720
about kind of the world we live in I

1227
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,909
notice a lot of the moms that come in

1228
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,618
with their children eventually kind of

1229
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:56,750
reach out for help okay the child's

1230
00:47:54,619 --> 00:48:00,349
doing better and now I'm a mess so can

1231
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:02,358
you help me and many of them will say

1232
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:05,450
I've heard about micro dosing I want to

1233
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:08,509
do micro dosing and what I say is okay

1234
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:12,169
throw that term out it's just a term

1235
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:14,510
that's you're trying to kind of you know

1236
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:16,278
I showed a poster of the reefer badness

1237
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,380
and it said she was a good girl until

1238
00:48:16,278 --> 00:48:22,400
she started using reefer or something I

1239
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:24,920
mean let's get over it okay if THC is

1240
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,139
your medicine it's your medicine whether

1241
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:31,039
it's one milligram or a hundred

1242
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:32,719
milligrams it's your medicine right so I

1243
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,200
think we should treat each other as

1244
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:38,629
adults in the room and if two and a half

1245
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:40,639
milligrams is your dose you may be

1246
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:43,309
saying oh I micro dose because you don't

1247
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:45,980
want to be seen as a STONER pothead

1248
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:48,740
whatever but you know that that dose

1249
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:51,619
helps you and hope again treating each

1250
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:53,419
other as adults if you are under the

1251
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:54,950
influence maybe don't drive your car

1252
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,778
don't take the kids to school when

1253
00:48:54,949 --> 00:48:58,848
you're under the influence or you know

1254
00:48:56,778 --> 00:49:01,400
whatever situation you're in that might

1255
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:06,200
be risky but at the same time I don't

1256
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:08,630
think that we in 2019 should be calling

1257
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:14,139
something micro dosing when it's

1258
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:14,140
actually a dose right well said

1259
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,979
[Music]

1260
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:22,980
dr. Shulman you showed some data showing

1261
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,720
that elderly people needed a different

1262
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,990
dose than they young would you comment

1263
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:26,989
on that

1264
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:35,490
whoops sorry I didn't mean to surprise I

1265
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:38,670
was just waiting for the specifics of

1266
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:40,799
the comment so I I think the primary

1267
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:44,039
reason why there's a bit of a difference

1268
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,599
in general is we we tend to approach the

1269
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,449
elderly patient in a more conservative

1270
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,460
fashion and we do start on a lower dose

1271
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:52,980
from the beginning because we don't want

1272
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,568
them to have a bad experience similar to

1273
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,730
some of the questions you were talking

1274
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:58,558
about that you ask patients we try to

1275
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:01,889
understand before we prescribe a

1276
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,680
medication in in the pharmacy if the

1277
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:06,239
patient has ever tried cannabis before

1278
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:09,960
what exact symptoms or conditions

1279
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:12,088
they're trying to deal with and also

1280
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,920
what their expectations are and what

1281
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:17,789
their lifestyles like because if if

1282
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,470
someone has never used cannabis 50 years

1283
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:21,869
ago recreationally and they have no idea

1284
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:24,000
what THC feels like you don't want to

1285
00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:25,559
give them a higher dose at the beginning

1286
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,079
and have them have a bad experience and

1287
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:29,910
then have them not want to even try it

1288
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,829
again because we know it might help them

1289
00:50:29,909 --> 00:50:34,139
so we always try to start lower so I

1290
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:35,490
think that's probably a functional

1291
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:37,949
reason for why there's there's

1292
00:50:35,489 --> 00:50:39,689
differences there and then ultimately I

1293
00:50:37,949 --> 00:50:42,509
think you could look at just simply

1294
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:44,940
metabolism in a younger person versus an

1295
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:46,260
older person as a reason why the dosing

1296
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,829
might end up being different in the long

1297
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:52,380
run I just want to add one more comment

1298
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:53,760
that came to mind as well is my patients

1299
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,950
really want to please me even though I

1300
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,450
tell them I say please just tell me tell

1301
00:50:55,949 --> 00:51:01,379
me what's going on I think it doesn't

1302
00:50:57,449 --> 00:51:02,699
matter and so they tell me that they're

1303
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,559
they're ordering what I what I've

1304
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:06,298
recommended but a lot of them what I've

1305
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,490
come to realize especially on Twitter

1306
00:51:06,298 --> 00:51:09,929
it's it's I've been asking some polls of

1307
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:12,058
people like you know how do you use it

1308
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:14,190
what do you use and then I chose a

1309
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,740
question I said well how much more would

1310
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:18,358
you use if you had no barriers and if

1311
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:20,250
you if money wasn't an issue and I

1312
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:22,019
realized like more than 50 percent

1313
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,789
needed 50 percent more than what they

1314
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:25,588
were using so I also want to mention

1315
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,400
that the doses we we're talking about

1316
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:28,048
here unless

1317
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,000
a clinical trial or an observational

1318
00:51:28,048 --> 00:51:31,829
study where it's been given like what

1319
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,409
they need or you know if they're allowed

1320
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:36,510
to go higher they do sometimes they're

1321
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:38,788
really hoarding and and stretching their

1322
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:42,150
their supply so just to say that I

1323
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:44,839
wanted to ask you if that data was from

1324
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:47,130
New York exclusively and so I know the

1325
00:51:44,838 --> 00:51:48,538
economics of medical cannabis in New

1326
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:50,730
York are somewhat restrictive for

1327
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:52,710
patients do you have any idea if your

1328
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:57,289
customers are shopping outside of your

1329
00:51:52,710 --> 00:52:00,389
stores for CBD for just like a full CBD

1330
00:51:57,289 --> 00:52:01,890
like are they using CBD to cut their

1331
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:03,900
total costs down

1332
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:07,139
we don't really ask about that in our

1333
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,789
surveys so I don't have a factual data

1334
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:11,068
set that would tell us that but I think

1335
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:13,470
a lot of people are starting to add that

1336
00:52:11,068 --> 00:52:15,058
in to kind of give a boost from the

1337
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:17,519
perspective of the total cannabinoid

1338
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:19,890
dose but I don't have anything specific

1339
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,989
there I think a lot of us were surprised

1340
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:23,969
at just how low the milligrams of CBD

1341
00:52:21,989 --> 00:52:25,649
were not that those are that's an

1342
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:28,399
ineffective dose but I would think the

1343
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,539
median might be a little bit higher

1344
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,849
perhaps the whole idea of the plant

1345
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:35,160
because it is more than CBD in there

1346
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:36,838
there no there are other minor

1347
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:39,210
cannabinoids in the products that we

1348
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:41,250
provide we don't necessarily spell out

1349
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,318
the exact milligrams of those but there

1350
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,900
are 10 different minor cannabinoids in

1351
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:47,699
the product formulations if you will

1352
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,139
permit the word micro dosing what I

1353
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:52,379
would say is if you're taking a hip

1354
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:54,808
product that is not THC free you are

1355
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,608
micro dosing THC and so there's

1356
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:59,670
definitely probably in effect from the

1357
00:52:56,608 --> 00:53:02,848
CBD as well as the THC you there and

1358
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:05,250
even epidemics the FDA approved CBD does

1359
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:08,088
have some THC in it and about half

1360
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:11,190
milligram per milliliter

1361
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:13,409
yeah no dr. McCallum brought up a really

1362
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:16,318
good point and that is honesty between a

1363
00:53:13,409 --> 00:53:17,460
clinician and patient when I was doing

1364
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,920
clinical work I used to use a

1365
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:25,139
psychological trick with people it

1366
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:27,420
sounds horrible a psychological trick so

1367
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:28,949
one of the things I used to do is if I

1368
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,619
said ask them to take something twice a

1369
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:33,058
day I mean it's no plant preparation

1370
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:35,338
twice a day I would say to them on the

1371
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:37,950
follow-up I would say so how's it going

1372
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:39,199
with your with your with your herbs and

1373
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:41,509
they say plying and then I

1374
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,269
say so are you getting that once a day

1375
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,930
and because I had told them to take it

1376
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:47,570
twice a day

1377
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:49,549
I just given them permission to tell me

1378
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:51,170
the truth because someone looked at me

1379
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:54,530
like no you said to take it twice a day

1380
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:56,780
well I'm getting it sometimes twice a

1381
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:58,609
day so I could actually really crack

1382
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,660
that I could get the truth from it

1383
00:53:58,608 --> 00:54:04,880
so that's it can actually be really

1384
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:07,250
super helpful we're coming to a close

1385
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,809
here we've got about five minutes so I'm

1386
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,699
gonna give you each of you the the

1387
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:13,150
opportunity to I guess you've got one

1388
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:16,219
minute each of you the opportunity to

1389
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:22,130
put your take on dosing in a couple

1390
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:24,259
sentences well Caroline that

1391
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:26,690
self-awareness is part of cannabis

1392
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,280
dosing it's really important to check in

1393
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:30,349
and see how you respond it to that dose

1394
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,300
write it down and then figure that out

1395
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:34,338
this is embedded into all my three

1396
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,260
patient education dosing programs on

1397
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:39,349
healer comm something called the inner

1398
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,730
inventory and I think we have 30 seconds

1399
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:42,019
left so tell you how to do it but you

1400
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:44,030
might not have time to check it right

1401
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:46,460
now or maybe so you take a deep breath

1402
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:48,200
you see how smooth and easy it is you

1403
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:50,300
rate that on a scale from one to ten ten

1404
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:52,639
is super smooth and easy one is tight

1405
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,650
hard to breathe then you take a few

1406
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:57,379
moments to just sit or stand

1407
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:59,240
let your body remain still and you rate

1408
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,769
on a scale from one to ten how easy is

1409
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:02,929
it for you to remain still how

1410
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:04,608
comfortable are you and then you put a

1411
00:55:02,929 --> 00:55:06,440
fake smile on your face give it a few

1412
00:55:04,608 --> 00:55:08,449
seconds and see how real that can become

1413
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,970
or just check in with yourself and see

1414
00:55:08,449 --> 00:55:12,679
how authentically content you feel on a

1415
00:55:10,969 --> 00:55:14,389
scale from one to ten those three

1416
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:16,129
numbers written down before and after

1417
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:17,989
you use cannabis each time and then you

1418
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:19,700
can look back at that as a trend will

1419
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:24,469
tell you a lot about if you're getting

1420
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:28,309
the dosing right beautiful can I just

1421
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:31,219
say when he said nope okay so what I

1422
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:33,469
think would be most helpful is I often

1423
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:36,219
tell my patients please please please

1424
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:39,709
track and log or products you're using

1425
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:42,318
if you throw the package away before you

1426
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:44,300
throw it away write down what it says on

1427
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:46,279
the label try to remember because you

1428
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,470
may try five different products and say

1429
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,599
you know what that first one was the one

1430
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:51,449
I really liked and oh shoot I can't

1431
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:53,700
remember what

1432
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:55,769
and it was or and I've had situations

1433
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:57,929
where I've had patients used something

1434
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,550
that they really liked and then they

1435
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:01,349
went back and it wasn't there so they

1436
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:04,380
tried a few other things and then they

1437
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:06,599
don't remember so we for one particular

1438
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,090
patient we have tried so many things and

1439
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:11,429
she cannot remember the name of and what

1440
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:14,820
it was and so on so I do encourage

1441
00:56:11,429 --> 00:56:16,710
people to journal there are online you

1442
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,780
can buy if you want to write things down

1443
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:20,699
you can buy medical they actually have

1444
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,140
cannabis journals that you know ask you

1445
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:23,789
what's the product and they give you

1446
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:26,039
space to put the CBD THC

1447
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:28,980
there's also apps where you can put your

1448
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:32,610
information in or if you want to go you

1449
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:34,500
know cheap and easy go to the drugstore

1450
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:36,150
and buy a notebook and just put the date

1451
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,550
down and put down the products you're

1452
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:40,470
using I think journaling is huge to be

1453
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:43,260
able to narrow in on what helps you the

1454
00:56:40,469 --> 00:56:46,739
most dr. Shepherd I'm sorry you've got

1455
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:48,630
45 seconds I'll be quick I think the

1456
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:50,429
most important thing about dosing is is

1457
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:51,750
managing expectations for a patient

1458
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:54,480
because one of the most fascinating

1459
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:56,579
things about medical cannabis is that

1460
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,440
one person's benefit is another person's

1461
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,779
side effect so you really have to help

1462
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,429
them understand what they might feel if

1463
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,610
it's not what they're expecting to treat

1464
00:57:02,429 --> 00:57:07,980
if I take something for sleep and I get

1465
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:10,289
the euphoria or the good feelings I'm

1466
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,949
gonna be surprised so have a really

1467
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:16,139
honest conversation about what to expect

1468
00:57:12,949 --> 00:57:18,089
okay so we've just said a lot of the

1469
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:20,519
points I would make but education is key

1470
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:22,800
having frequent check-ins and monitoring

1471
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:24,449
I find very helpful and making changes

1472
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,130
so if you are using oils try

1473
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:28,769
vaporization and vice versa

1474
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:32,099
maybe it's CBD maybe it's THC maybe it's

1475
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:33,329
TGA try another products and one thing

1476
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:35,279
we haven't really talked about is

1477
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:37,259
recreational use and I really do

1478
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,580
recommend the exact same things for

1479
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,230
recreation well that would be what I

1480
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:42,329
would recommend I don't see a lot of

1481
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:43,949
patients for recreational purposes but I

1482
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:46,500
think that especially in Canada we're

1483
00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:48,149
changing the packaging come this fall in

1484
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:51,780
terms of what's going to be available is

1485
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:53,160
using a logical approach because if the

1486
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,840
full package of gummy bears is a

1487
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:56,759
thousand milligrams people may take a

1488
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,559
thousand and think that that's what the

1489
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,630
dose is so really again would be a

1490
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,969
mindful approach to recreational use as

1491
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:05,318
well so these to all the product makers

1492
00:58:02,969 --> 00:58:06,968
here it's okay if you label the

1493
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:08,619
total content per bottle but put

1494
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:10,809
something a little more specific around

1495
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:12,519
an actual dosage it's very helpful for

1496
00:58:10,809 --> 00:58:15,789
patients milligrams per milliliter

1497
00:58:12,518 --> 00:58:18,429
milligrams per dose whatever try it for

1498
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:20,440
peace whatever so I just like to close

1499
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:22,719
and say to me this was extremely

1500
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,179
valuable because you've got it from in

1501
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,889
the trenches here and speaking of the

1502
00:58:25,179 --> 00:58:28,118
trenches I want to take my hat off and

1503
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:30,489
give these guys a huge applause these

1504
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:30,940
are medical warriors thank you for what

1505
00:58:30,489 --> 00:58:35,559
you do

1506
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,559
[Applause]
