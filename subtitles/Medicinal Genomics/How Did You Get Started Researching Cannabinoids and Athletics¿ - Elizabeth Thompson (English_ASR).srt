1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,629
[Music]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,480
so I think a good place to start is why

3
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,518
don't you tell us how you got involved

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,039
in researching cannaboids and Athletics

5
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,799
yeah for sure um so it was not a linear

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,840
path as I don't think anybody's ever

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,960
really is but my undergraduate degree is

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:32,118
in molecular biology and then I have a m

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,359
M's degree and applied physiology and I

10
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:36,399
was always athletic and so with my uh

11
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:38,000
physiology degree we were always looking

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,840
at you know training principles or just

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,799
basically principles of physiology of

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,160
how can you really push the human body

15
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,078
to do things that you want it to do

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,799
essentially using non-pharmacological

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,399
agents so looking at you know training

18
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:53,519
principles or nutrition or even

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,960
supplementation whatever so um I worked

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,160
with athletes and I also worked

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,280
clinically so I had a patient population

22
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,238
um but the the biggest driving Factor it

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,599
was my husband's actually was an athlete

24
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,438
a professional athlete and we've been

25
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,158
together since we were 17 years old and

26
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:10,118
I would watch him play and I was like

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,680
man this is not going to end well if you

28
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,560
keep on you know the head contact and

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,720
the contact and the contact and so just

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,680
knowing having a background really of

31
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,640
molecular mechanisms and understanding

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,200
what was happening all the time I

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,000
started to really look for ways to

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,880
reduce the neuro inflammation just

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,078
thinking like I don't want to be feeding

36
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,679
you with a straw when we're 80 years old

37
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:31,199
so let's see what we can do there's got

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,759
to be things and there are a lot of

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,960
things you can do which is the

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,840
empowering part about understanding

41
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,000
physiology is there's a ton that you can

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,320
do to really help support your system to

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,478
reduce those things and so um I I

44
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,078
started looking specifically so when he

45
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,879
was playing really was in the 2000s so

46
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,798
I'll date myself here but it was really

47
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,319
the height of the opioid epidemics in

48
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,280
athletics like there was a lot of

49
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,359
exposure of opioids and you know we we

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,118
had teammates that ended up with opioid

51
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,000
problems we buried some teammates and I

52
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,879
was like you know there has to be

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,959
something better than this and so in

54
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,878
order to understand that I wanted to

55
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,478
understand the mechanisms of how opioids

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,280
worked and so I started to look at the

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,120
molecular mechanisms and the brain of

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,239
how opioids were actually working and

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,080
physiologically like why are people how

60
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,319
does it kill you what is happening here

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,400
and so I came across research that

62
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:26,799
suggested that using canono you could

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,920
actually reduce the required amount of

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,480
opioids to have the same pain efficacy

65
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,039
and I was thinking like that's crazy how

66
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,439
would that even work and I didn't really

67
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,679
know anything about cannabis at all you

68
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,639
know I mean I was a downhill ski racer

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,680
and I I played rugby I was always like

70
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,039
you know an endorphin junkie and so we

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,959
understood cannabis from like a

72
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,400
recreational cultural standpoint I grew

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,000
up in Canada it's always around but I

74
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,680
didn't really understand anything about

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,239
the molecular mechanisms which was

76
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,920
shocking because I'd already finished

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,840
two degrees that were focusing on

78
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,559
molecular mechanisms and I had never

79
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,719
seen anything about the endocannabinoid

80
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,239
system

81
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,680
so anyways I started looking at that and

82
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,640
um I kind of went down a rabbit hole and

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,200
I have been there for probably the last

84
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,919
done or 15 years just looking at the

85
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,359
different ways that the endocannabinoid

86
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,798
system can work um really a

87
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,040
neuroinflammation but it really goes

88
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,599
everywhere throughout your whole body

89
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,639
and so it was looking at things like

90
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:25,359
that and and um so then I applied to you

91
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,199
know I thought okay well I I think this

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
I saw the mechanism that I really wanted

93
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,000
to look at and it was the calcium

94
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,238
channel so just getting like super were

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,479
nerdy here but it was the the calcium

96
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,519
channels in the neurons and I thought

97
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,000
well like who's looking at this and so I

98
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,599
looked for any supervisor anywhere that

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,120
was actually studying that and of course

100
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,199
after having a couple people tell you

101
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,319
you're totally crazy because it's like

102
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,359
hey have you ever looked at using

103
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,878
cannabis to reduce neuroinflammation and

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,560
most people are like yeah Kate next I

105
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,438
don't know what you're talking about but

106
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,158
my supervisor now um he he was one of

107
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,078
the first people he like the only paper

108
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:02,280
that I actually found at that time that

109
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,239
was published specifically talking about

110
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,840
um some of the cyto kindes and

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,480
chemokines that that happen you know

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,519
when you have neuroinflammation and the

113
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,560
potential for maybe some things that

114
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,319
canono could do to reduce those and so I

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,798
contacted him um and he knew exactly

116
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:18,680
what I was talking about and so I was

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,279
like so thrilled and so I thought I was

118
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,560
going to have to beg him to take me on

119
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,159
as a graduate student but he said oh oh

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,439
yeah like I would love to have you and

121
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,080
so um I applied and so I I wanted to

122
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,639
look at concussion specific specifically

123
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,240
it was concussion and neuroinflammation

124
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,639
in the brain and um you know he was

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,840
happy to do that and right after that we

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,120
saw the call from the NFL I was actually

127
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,159
outside watering my first cannabis plant

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,478
that I ever grew and it was in 2021 and

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,120
it came across my phone and I was like

130
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,079
Patrick check it out like the NFL is

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,319
actually putting up money to study the

132
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,079
thing that I just said like I I this why

133
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,599
we want to look at and so I didn't

134
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,959
really think we would apply I thought

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,120
that he'd be like hey cool like we're

136
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,399
not crazy you know we're this is not

137
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,000
some you know people think that yes

138
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,560
someone else thinks this and so he would

139
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,319
but instead he was like okay yeah we're

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,399
going to apply and so he went and he

141
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,199
gathered and he's wonderful so he

142
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,038
gathered people that he had worked with

143
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,960
over the course of his career to look at

144
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:19,000
like we're looking at so many different

145
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,279
metrics but um we had to put in for it

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,519
was an NIH adjudication to go through

147
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,198
you know all the different researchers

148
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:27,279
that applied for the funding and um and

149
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,000
we were selected as the group that the

150
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,439
NFL would fund to look at all the

151
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,399
different metric

152
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:36,038
um for using cannabinoids for

153
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,560
neuroinflammation concussion pain and

154
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:40,478
then opioid sparing so he's my one

155
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,600
supervisor that took me on and then I'm

156
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,519
actually double supervised um my other

157
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,199
supervisor is the Dina Pharmacy so my

158
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,758
PhD is in pharmacy at the University of

159
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,038
Saskatchewan so those two are my

160
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,960
supervisors and we have a team an

161
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,279
amazing team of people that are looking

162
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,239
at so many different metrics of um yeah

163
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,519
how we can use canono to potentially

164
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,600
reduce so some of the things you know so

165
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,279
for me it's very personal I have people

166
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,720
in my life like we are surrounded by

167
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,918
athletes I grew up in sports and you

168
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,240
know you can only change so many rules

169
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:14,079
and redesign a helmet and a mouth guard

170
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,160
so many ways but unless you're actually

171
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,918
focusing on the molecular things inside

172
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,759
the skull you're missing a massive

173
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,359
opportunity to do something um that I

174
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,319
believe you know we need the data and

175
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,120
that's why we're getting it um to prove

176
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,720
that what what we believe to be true is

177
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,598
actually happening in humans and we have

178
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,599
a ton of pre-clinical there's a ton of

179
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:36,560
animal models that show it but because

180
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:39,478
of the laws and the prohibitory you know

181
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,399
the prohibition and the inability for

182
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:45,199
researchers to put this substance in a

183
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,120
human and actually draw data which in

184
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,439
Canada now is even doubly ridiculous

185
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,360
because people can walk down the street

186
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,199
and buy it anywhere they want and it's

187
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,400
still actually very hard to do research

188
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,000
in Canada even though at the federal

189
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:00,878
level it's legal we're we've been legal

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
there since 2018 and so it's accessible

191
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,599
to anybody in our country that's over

192
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,279
the legal age but to do research was

193
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,918
actually still very difficult that's why

194
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,399
it's taken us so long you know that was

195
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:16,359
in 2021 and we just finished um the

196
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,399
first portion of the clinical trial so

197
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,759
it's yeah I mean I feel like there'd be

198
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,359
a lot more human data if the policies

199
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,720
would have allowed researchers to do the

200
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,560
research that they've been trying to do

201
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,560
for a really long time

202
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:41,879
