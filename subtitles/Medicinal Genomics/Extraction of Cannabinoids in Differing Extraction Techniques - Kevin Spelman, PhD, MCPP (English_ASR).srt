1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,798
so

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:09,199
the spot you never want to have

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,519
is the last lecture of the day in the b

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,518
room

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,439
but here we are

6
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,679
and i'm honored that you're here uh so

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,400
let me uh let me walk you through a

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,679
little story here about um

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:28,959
ethanol extractions of cbd so clearly

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,599
there's a huge number of home gardens or

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,280
one of the areas where i got my biggest

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,759
education on

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,079
cannabis those home gardens were

14
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:42,079
actually home forests

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,079
of cannabis trees

16
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:49,439
and as a result of all this legalization

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,640
a lot of people are making stuff at home

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,079
and so

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,558
one of the things that

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,960
i've always at being an herbalist first

21
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,358
and then getting into cannabis so for me

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,558
cannabis is yet another medicinal plant

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,760
a special one but another one

24
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,039
you know i've been making tinctures

25
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,359
forever

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
and the medical scientist side of me was

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,920
like well

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,640
you know what's in these things so

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,400
start with this story so

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,879
back in the days when i was in between

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
university of exeter in the uk and

32
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,519
university of north carolina i was

33
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,879
working on echinacea and i drilled down

34
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,640
really hard for four years on echinacea

35
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,078
and um

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,079
one of the things i was doing i kept

37
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,839
extracting a bunch of different economic

38
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,158
echinacea angustifolia echinacea

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,520
purporia echinacea palada like all these

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
different species that are out there in

41
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,200
the market and by the way most of it is

42
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,759
purporia

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,478
and then there some research came out uh

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,478
just about the time i was starting my my

45
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,679
uh dissertation work

46
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,399
on

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,920
achillamides or alkalamides there's

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,359
uh you'll see you'll hear you'll hear

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,439
both pronunciations binding to cb2 so

50
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,478
suddenly echinacea was like you know a

51
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:04,559
cannabis medic or a phytocannabinoid you

52
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,840
could argue that but you know there was

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,800
a compound in there or actually several

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,719
compounds

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,040
these compounds that would bind cb2

56
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,639
i once had the owner of an herb company

57
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,280
come up to me and say

58
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,719
hey if i take echinacea is it going to

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,719
keep me from getting high

60
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,598
no don't worry it's that's not going to

61
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,878
happen

62
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,878
but so i started looking at these

63
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,280
compounds and i like i said i drill down

64
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,679
pretty heavily on them and

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,400
you can't see the way they're shaped now

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,519
but if you if you saw machulin's lecture

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
today when he was talking about all

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,239
these amides

69
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,159
you can see that that tail can fold and

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,000
you know

71
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,759
form kind of a partial ring it's not

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,800
really a ring but it's an open ring

73
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,359
right and so these bind cb2 rather well

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,760
and so one day i'm in the lab and i'm

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,239
tincturing yet some more echinacea so i

76
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,280
can run mass spec analysis on it and

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,800
then put it in biological assays

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,400
and i go to i tincture it i go home i go

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
to bed and i wake up in the middle of

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,239
the night and i go oh my god i just

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,640
missed an opportunity

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,039
because there's always been this

83
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:18,318
discussion in the industry

84
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,439
the medicinal plant industry is how long

85
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,679
do you have to macerate or steep

86
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,878
plant material and alcohol before it's

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,439
ready

88
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,359
and the traditional wisdom has been oh

89
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,400
two weeks is good and four weeks is even

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
better

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,280
and i used to have a close friend who

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,879
ran an herb company would say oh i do

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,479
stuff that's three months and it's even

94
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,560
better than the one month and i've done

95
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,639
six months and it's it just

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,318
just rocks

97
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,318
and so i've always been a little

98
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,679
skeptical and if you ask any chemist and

99
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,119
i know there's probably some chemists in

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,719
the room right now

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,239
they were they're rolling their eyes

102
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,598
right now

103
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,599
because because they already know know

104
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,518
better right

105
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,598
so um

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,280
so i woke up the next morning went right

107
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,878
into the lab when i took a sample of

108
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,479
this tincture that i had planned on ting

109
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,199
shrink for two weeks

110
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,639
okay so i got it at about 24 hours time

111
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,079
point

112
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,399
and

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,319
this publication is what came out of it

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
and this data was buried in a bunch of

115
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,759
mass spec data so nobody really saw this

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,680
data

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,000
i forget which which figure it was but

118
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
it was well into the map manuscript and

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,240
most people their eyes roll back by the

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
time they get to table two and they're

121
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,560
you know in figure figure three and

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,279
they're done um but you can see here day

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,439
two in other words 24 hours later

124
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,198
you can see that the the relative

125
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,160
concentration of

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,600
uh dodeca tetra tetraene

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,680
this alkalamide is

128
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,919
really kind of peaking

129
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
and you look at day seven

130
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,478
and you know there's really no

131
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,879
difference

132
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,478
and you look at day 14 two weeks which

133
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,199
is what we're supposed to do in the

134
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,240
industry and and by the way in the

135
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
industry

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
you've got barrels and barrels and all

137
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,879
these herb shops all these are

138
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,839
production facilities filling floor

139
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,759
space

140
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:12,000
because it's sitting there for weeks

141
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,240
um and then so i was like well and let's

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
make sure we go 21 days so that we can

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,360
show that there's really no difference

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,038
like i said the chemist in the room are

145
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,080
going yeah yeah what what's what's the

146
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,519
news here but the herbalists in the room

147
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,519
were blown away

148
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,079
right or not in this room but or maybe

149
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,120
you are already but um

150
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,519
when i

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,199
showed you the data i'm about to do um

152
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,198
you're going to be really quite

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,080
surprised so i went to the literature

154
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,879
and i said to myself self can i find any

155
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,079
bet anything better than 24 hours

156
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,360
and

157
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,599
found a couple of studies now they

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,439
weren't on cannabis but you know they're

159
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,520
pulling compounds that have some

160
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,279
lipophilicity to them

161
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,439
in this case we're looking at carnosol

162
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,359
and carnosic acid

163
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,240
and you know at

164
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
uh

165
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,879
in ethanol at 70 percent versus ethanol

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,478
at 100 percent

167
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,319
and then they've got a methanol in there

168
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,839
i typically ignore that because we're

169
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,360
not going to use that to make tinctures

170
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,198
right

171
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,720
hopefully

172
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,240
so you see that really at three hours

173
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
there's not a lot of difference between

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,240
six hours but six hours it really kind

175
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,000
of peaks and there's not really much

176
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,240
difference between six hours and 10

177
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
hours so now i'm going okay so we've got

178
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,840
something close to three hours and we've

179
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,080
got something close to six hours so how

180
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,719
many hours do we really need

181
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,478
um so here's another study and again

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,120
three hours in this particular case our

183
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,120
carnosic acid there's no difference

184
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,918
so

185
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
then i went to the cannabis literature

186
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,439
and i i looked at some literature and

187
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,359
there are there are some

188
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,879
tincture literatures out uh

189
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,400
research out there

190
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,319
but you know here

191
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,879
this one actually is really new i think

192
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,400
this is uh actually no sorry this is the

193
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:59,439
2008 one um they looked at 20 40 80

194
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,879
ethanol um and by the way before we

195
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,120
i think most people when they're

196
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,879
tincturing with ethanol they're usually

197
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,079
using 100 percent

198
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,598
and that's what we did and i'll tell you

199
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,240
why in a second but

200
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,759
um if you really want a full spectrum

201
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,439
extract

202
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,520
you're probably going to want to use

203
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,160
lower than 100 percent

204
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,519
now what will it cost you it'll cost you

205
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,800
some

206
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,799
small percentage of thc or thca

207
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,478
because of their lipophilicity but

208
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,160
you're also going to get more flavonoids

209
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,680
that way you're probably going to get

210
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,919
more terpenes that way

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
you know 80 70 to 80 percent tends to be

212
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,839
the sweet spot with a lot of different

213
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,079
compounds especially uh polyphenols

214
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,119
um and you know we see that here for the

215
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,639
most part in terms of

216
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,399
distribution of thc and thc

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,160
a

218
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,000
so

219
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,599
then i said let's take this to cannabis

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,918
and check it out so here's what we did

221
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,478
so we we took up a batch of cannabis and

222
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,959
this is hemp okay so cannabis sativa the

223
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:08,959
chemotype is cbd right

224
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,680
and we used a 400 um micron sieve

225
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,839
so

226
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,280
kind of

227
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,638
a coarse

228
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,679
grind

229
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,680
and uh homogenized that and when we got

230
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,439
done with homogenizing i homogenized it

231
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,800
some more because i knew this that the

232
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,478
whole thing had to depend on that

233
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,478
starting biomass it had to be mixed

234
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,159
really really well so we mixed it and

235
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,639
mixed it and mixed it

236
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,840
then we took 100 grams samples

237
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,240
collected

238
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:38,158
and added 500 grams of 95 ethanol

239
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,560
to that so that's going to steep so the

240
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,718
maceration treatment started but then we

241
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,879
also had an arm and i'm realizing now i

242
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,160
have that arm in the wrong place but we

243
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,679
also took

244
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,759
and did some percolation i'm going to

245
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,359
show you that data in a second but i

246
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,120
really want to focus on the maceration

247
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
right now so those of you who don't know

248
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,799
percolation i'll explain that process in

249
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,359
a second but i wanted to

250
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,559
try two different traditional

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,278
home used techniques the maceration and

252
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,879
the percolation

253
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,519
and then we went through a couple more

254
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,200
steps we we took we collected the mark

255
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,959
the mark if you're not familiar with

256
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,680
herbal medicine the mark is the the

257
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,239
plant material the biomass

258
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:22,079
and then you would press that mark

259
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,200
right and then you you'd get uh

260
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,720
the

261
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,040
the press from the mark and you'd also

262
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
get the pour off the liquor that you

263
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,799
poured off the the tincture and i'll

264
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,278
show you these steps if this doesn't

265
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,199
make sense just yet and and so what we

266
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,759
did is we did duplicate independent

267
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,399
duplicate

268
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,559
extracts and then we took triplicate

269
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,639
samples from each of those duplicates

270
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,838
and then we did triplicate

271
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,639
analysis of the triplicate samples

272
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,040
so

273
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,278
trying to really stick with with

274
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,958
some good statistics because i knew that

275
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,958
the herb industry would never believe me

276
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,120
so there's the cannabis

277
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,759
and this is the bio starting biomass

278
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
like i said we mixed and mixed and mixed

279
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,838
and here's what here's where we ended up

280
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,240
so it was about uh

281
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,240
about a eight point five percent your

282
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,200
average is eight point eight uh four

283
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,320
percent

284
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,079
um

285
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,240
cbd

286
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,799
and you can see our p-value is pretty

287
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,799
strong there

288
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,958
and then we ran it through the sieve a

289
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:30,000
four micro uh four micron or four

290
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,199
thousands gives me micron uh civ

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
and

292
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,240
um

293
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,560
so we had consistency and then to really

294
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,320
mimic home extractions we took ball jars

295
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,159
which is usually what herbalists use and

296
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,278
i've used forever and

297
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,278
and uh

298
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,439
fascinatingly my house used to be so

299
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,519
full of ball jars and then

300
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,600
and then when i partnered with a lovely

301
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,278
woman um i kind of let go of the ball

302
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,360
jars and now my house is full of jars

303
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,679
again because she can't

304
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,839
i'm just like those jars are menacing me

305
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,559
in the in the

306
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,760
dishwasher because i'm the guy that

307
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,239
deals with the dishwasher right

308
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,879
so then after we tinctured

309
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,680
we poured off the liquor or often called

310
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,360
the menstruum in herbal medicine

311
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,559
we poured that off

312
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,639
and then we took the mark which is in

313
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,639
wrapped in the um

314
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,639
the cheesecloth there

315
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,559
and we pressed that

316
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,958
and we bought a press that was easily

317
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,879
available so usually you have these high

318
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,278
top like five ton presses that you use

319
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,439
that are like car jack kind of things

320
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,399
well we just bought this wine press off

321
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,560
of amazon i think it was 74

322
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,240
so that we had something that was really

323
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,439
readily available and wasn't super

324
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
expensive

325
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,920
and you know actually it did okay i mean

326
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
there's presses it'll do much better

327
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,919
but it did okay

328
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,360
so we pressed the mark

329
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,039
and

330
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,720
you'll see on the left side of the

331
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,439
screen that's what we poured off from

332
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,079
the ball jar okay and on the right side

333
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,480
of the screen is now the

334
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,359
remaining liquid that was in the biomass

335
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,159
that got

336
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,159
pressed out

337
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,200
and there's a molecule we were looking

338
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:16,199
for cannabidiol now this cannabis was

339
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,200
decarboxylated

340
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,720
and so here's what we got

341
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,278
at three minutes

342
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,040
versus one hour versus two week

343
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,879
so in one hour

344
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,240
this extraction was done

345
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,519
and like i said the chemist in here

346
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,399
going yeah yeah

347
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,320
are you going to tell me something i

348
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,559
don't know yet

349
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,040
but at three minutes we had 94 of the

350
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,039
one hour

351
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,320
so

352
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,000
it always made me wonder because this

353
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,440
quick wash technique that you hear about

354
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,600
right cold wash

355
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,480
the cold wash or a quick wash

356
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,320
um

357
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,039
you know that's

358
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,800
faster than three minutes so

359
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,000
i would guess but i'd like to do this

360
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,919
study i would guess that they're

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,720
probably getting pretty high

362
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,439
uh yield

363
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,759
and then if you can compare the drain

364
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,360
versus the press cbd

365
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,200
and this is the problem that people have

366
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,440
at home pressing

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,600
right because what are you going to do i

368
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,040
mean some people take the cheesecloth

369
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,360
the plant materials wrapped in the

370
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,519
cheesecloth and they just turn it and

371
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,039
squeeze it right that's one way to do it

372
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,159
and you ca and you want to do that

373
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,319
because look at the amount of

374
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,958
cbd we got from the press

375
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,879
although it was much lower volume

376
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,278
the amount that we got was actually

377
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,360
pretty significant so you always want to

378
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,320
press and

379
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,320
it's not hard to do

380
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,560
um and then we looked at the mark so

381
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,120
this is the mark after it's been pressed

382
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,919
now if you looked at this you would

383
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,240
argue that it looks to me like that

384
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,240
two-week mark has got less cbd in it and

385
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,839
therefore it probably should have had a

386
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
higher yield

387
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,839
but it actually didn't

388
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,278
according to the data that we have

389
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,880
so did we lose some cbd somewhere

390
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,879
i don't know

391
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,759
but i'm still scratching my head on this

392
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,919
one

393
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,198
and actually i don't think these i don't

394
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,799
have the stat bars in here but i don't

395
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,719
think this was statistically significant

396
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:18,240
in terms of the one 1.16 to 0.98 so it

397
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
also may be a factor here

398
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,720
okay now let's turn to the percolation

399
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,198
okay so now what have we learned the one

400
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,278
thing that i really want you to get is

401
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,439
there might be a reason to run a

402
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,078
tincture for

403
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,000
longer than an hour or even i'm guessing

404
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,000
half an hour is enough but that's

405
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,799
another study there might be a reason to

406
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,039
do that but it's not chemistry

407
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,879
okay so people get into the moon cycles

408
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,439
and that so yeah great if that's what

409
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:48,320
you're into maybe that's the way to do

410
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,959
it right for your medicine the for the

411
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,480
medicine you want to give to people but

412
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,719
for chemistry

413
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
you don't need two weeks you don't need

414
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,079
a month

415
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,799
you just really need a few minutes

416
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:02,559
so

417
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,719
now how do you make a percolation con so

418
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,638
percolation cones they're in old

419
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,120
pharmacies you can still find them out

420
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,480
back in the back shelf hidden

421
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,039
with dust all over them because they

422
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,720
haven't been moved in like 40 years

423
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,799
but old pharmacies this is one of the

424
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,360
ways that we made medicine in the united

425
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,958
states that pharmacists made medicine in

426
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,199
the united states for

427
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,159
decades and decades is they would get a

428
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,278
big percolation cone and by big you know

429
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,439
they were

430
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,078
they were this size the one

431
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,880
the ones that i know of um and they're a

432
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:37,679
cone right and so there's

433
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,360
the trick here is the liquid flow

434
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,919
through that cone

435
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
because you've got moving liquid which

436
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,479
is one of the things you want you know

437
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,079
that's something i should tell you about

438
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,240
maceration every one of those

439
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,039
macerations were

440
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,839
stirred vigorously for one minute

441
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,278
and then the timing

442
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,519
started so in the same sort of way we

443
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,039
have movement here and movement is

444
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,720
important one of the things i was

445
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,120
talking about yesterday with extractions

446
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,360
is you know there's really four

447
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,759
crucial factors one is solvent one is

448
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,720
temperature one is pressure and one may

449
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,720
be agitation right so this is a sort of

450
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,440
agitation a movement

451
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,040
so

452
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,360
how do you make a percolation cone out

453
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,439
of a period bottle well you score the

454
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,600
top of it and herbalists have been doing

455
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,839
this forever you score the top of it and

456
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
now you have an opening at the top

457
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,199
and you

458
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,399
hang on to your cap

459
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,639
the um

460
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,198
the cap that you would use to close it

461
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,480
and that becomes a stop [ __ ] that

462
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,838
becomes a way of controlling your rate

463
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,920
okay

464
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,800
and so we ran that percolation and

465
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,039
there's been an age-old argument between

466
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,958
herbalist about what's better maceration

467
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:51,278
or percolation the thing about a

468
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:54,000
percolation is it only takes um

469
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,078
usually a couple of hours

470
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,919
so a couple hours and it's done and if

471
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,919
you're doing percolation right if you if

472
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,319
you go and you read the united states

473
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,318
pharmacopoeia from way back when that's

474
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,120
the way they were making medicine they

475
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,000
tell you to take the the biomass

476
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,198
and

477
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
just

478
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,038
really moisten it not it's not in liquid

479
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,400
it's just moistened with ethanol

480
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,919
and so if you think about that one of

481
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,319
the things that does is it breaks down

482
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,400
the cell walls

483
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,480
so once you do that then with that moist

484
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,919
stuff then you pack the cone and that

485
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,519
pack is key

486
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,200
if it's too loose it's just going to run

487
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,639
the liquids just going to run through

488
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,080
and if it's too tight the liquid is not

489
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,600
going to run so you get people get

490
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,119
really that do this for a living get

491
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,119
really good at packing these things

492
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,919
so

493
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,440
here's what we've got and we're

494
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:48,240
comparing it to the two-week

495
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,640
comparison here um so liquor recovery

496
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,558
was about 67 that's a total liquid that

497
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
we got right so the liquor recovery is

498
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,599
about 67 percent

499
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,000
um in the first extraction about 72 in

500
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:03,279
the next extraction in the perk it was

501
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,679
higher all around 76 and 74.

502
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,639
keep in mind that we actually tried to

503
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,280
press

504
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,160
the mark that came from the perk

505
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,399
we got zero milliliters from it

506
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,320
because it was already so dry so this is

507
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,759
another advantage not only do you not

508
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,519
need a press

509
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,879
but you can just

510
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,480
you've collected all the liquor that

511
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,360
you're going to possibly get from a

512
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,360
percolation cone

513
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,120
and then if we look at cbd recovery and

514
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
that's the darker gray there that you

515
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,558
want to look at

516
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,119
um the perk one we got about eighty

517
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,960
eighty percent 79.2 and park two we got

518
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,399
about 81 percent

519
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,759
as compared to about 61 versus 65 now

520
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,759
keep in mind this is not 61 cbd

521
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,440
this is 61 recovery of the cbd

522
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:56,839
right so we started with about 8.8

523
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,840
milligrams we got 61 percent of that

524
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,279
and then there's your your graph and i i

525
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,480
compared it here on the graph a one hour

526
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,720
versus a

527
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,919
versus the percolation and you can see

528
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,519
it's really

529
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,480
significantly uh higher i mean you got

530
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,759
about 15 percent more cbd in that

531
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,519
percolation

532
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,240
shorter time period doesn't take up a

533
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,240
bunch of space

534
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,320
so

535
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,160
future directions for this one of the

536
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,159
things i'd really like to do is i'd like

537
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,640
to do a quick wash comparison to a short

538
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,798
maceration just to see what's going on

539
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,559
there i'd also like to experiment with

540
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,519
percent ethanol

541
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,359
and i say that not so much because

542
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,759
i'm interested in the cannabinoid yield

543
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,159
although i am i'm more interested in

544
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,879
being able to look at the polyphenols

545
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,960
and comparing the polyphenol

546
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,559
content at 100 percent which is what

547
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,519
most people are using for their uh

548
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,519
cannabinoid extracts versus like 70 or

549
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,119
80 percent

550
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,519
and then i'd like to do

551
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,959
some studies with hot ethanol with cold

552
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,158
ethanol and then room temperature

553
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,279
ethanol in both a percolation method and

554
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,280
a maceration method

555
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,240
and that's it

556
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,240
ethan

557
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,919
kevin a couple of quickies it was quick

558
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,400
i didn't uh gather what the temperature

559
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,240
was of the ethanol you were using

560
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,440
room temperature okay

561
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,079
so um say you were using fresh material

562
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,360
rather than dried wouldn't it make sense

563
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:34,319
then to use the high proof ethanol

564
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,158
oh absolutely so and that's i thought

565
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,480
about showing some data like that from

566
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,559
uh some other work i've done

567
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,240
yeah if you if you're using fresh plant

568
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,158
material so

569
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,000
uh let's talk this through for a second

570
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,960
so i noticed that we did a one to five

571
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,960
this is traditional dry plant right

572
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,480
one to five and some people now we're

573
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,679
doing one to threes just to make things

574
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,599
stronger but

575
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,200
so one part is plant material five parts

576
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,279
is the um

577
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,960
uh the the solvent the the menstruum

578
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,399
when you use water

579
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,919
depending on what part of the plant you

580
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,280
are you've probably got somewhere

581
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,360
between 85 to 95

582
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,558
water content

583
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,119
so

584
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,879
we say in the industry that fresh plants

585
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,639
should be one to two

586
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,600
but if you really do the math there it's

587
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,720
really about a one to eleven

588
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,119
so

589
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,240
dry plant ends up being

590
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,719
chemically stronger there may be reasons

591
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,400
for example enzymatic action

592
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,759
in the drying process that breaks down

593
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
compounds

594
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,519
for doing a fresh plant versus a dry

595
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,559
plant

596
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,038
but

597
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,119
fresh plant even though it's one to two

598
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,319
with that ninety percent water content

599
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,319
right

600
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:52,519
is not really one to two

601
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,519
more like one to ten one to eleven

602
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,038
stupefied i see

603
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,000
it was amazing

604
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,400
yeah sure so if it's uh let's go back to

605
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,440
what the the percolation cone looks like

606
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,480
so if you're doing this right

607
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,480
and

608
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,919
doesn't have to be done this way but if

609
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,319
you're doing this right with the old

610
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,480
percolation cones they were really tall

611
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,798
so that you could pour all the solvent

612
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,279
or minstrum in there

613
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:38,158
and so you were done you could walk away

614
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,240
now with smaller bottles like perrier

615
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
you can't necessarily do that because

616
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,000
you don't necessarily depends on how

617
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,480
fault how full you fill the bottle with

618
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,119
the with the plant material

619
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,960
you can't necessarily do that

620
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,079
because if it's too full you're just

621
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,200
gonna have to stand there and keep

622
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,839
feeding it

623
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,360
right but if if if you get a proper

624
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,000
percolation cone and they're hard to

625
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,839
find and they're really expensive

626
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,798
you can

627
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,798
just pour it in and be done

628
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,879
thank you so much for sharing this

629
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,640
information because i i feel like you're

630
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,280
taking thoughts right out of my head so

631
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,840
one second hey can you turn that up

632
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,918
i can't hear

633
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:27,599
really and part of that is my age sorry

634
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:30,159
but um i don't know is that better

635
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,519
yeah can you hear me now yeah okay great

636
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,280
thanks um

637
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,038
so i really appreciate your talk thank

638
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,119
you so much i feel like you're pulling

639
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,879
thoughts right out of my head so i've

640
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,399
said for a long time i feel like

641
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
percolations

642
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,600
are a missing link in the industry so

643
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,278
i'm curious if you did other tests or

644
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,519
you did double washes because in

645
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,919
traditional percolation sometimes you do

646
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,918
a second wash through and then i'd be

647
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,679
curious the other things that you tested

648
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,759
for in the tincture like what other

649
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,200
compounds you're looking for etc you're

650
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:03,038
bringing up a great great point so um

651
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,319
so i ran a production facility for a

652
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,599
while co2

653
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,158
extraction

654
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,480
and we definitely looked at our mark to

655
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,120
see what was left

656
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,919
the cbd sitting in the in the mark

657
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,599
and

658
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,679
you know one of the things we found was

659
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,079
that we were only getting about half of

660
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,360
the cbd with the co2 extraction that we

661
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,038
were using

662
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,918
uh this is a supercritical fluid

663
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,119
extraction right co2 and so we started

664
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,919
running again

665
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,759
or we take it and we do it with ethanol

666
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,320
and we

667
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,119
yield more cbd right so so that that's

668
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:41,439
an option now in this case according to

669
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,558
this data and this model

670
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,400
um

671
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,319
it looks like there's not much left it

672
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,480
looks like there's you know less than

673
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,439
twenty percent of cbd left at the very

674
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,319
most

675
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,320
and so yeah you could run it again and

676
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,480
probably get more

677
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,879
um but i'm not sure how much more you

678
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,880
would get

679
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,798
you did you test for other compounds as

680
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:07,519
well besides no so that's something i

681
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,759
meant to say when i started this uh

682
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,278
very quick lecture

683
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,679
um

684
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,960
we didn't have any funding so uh you

685
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,679
know this was

686
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,079
all

687
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,159
out of pocket and uh

688
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,918
yeah we we did it as cheaply as possible

689
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,919
but i insisted on triplicate samples of

690
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,919
triplicate samples

691
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,919
so

692
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,720
thank you very much

693
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,079
sure so

694
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,919
it's it's really well so temperature

695
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,720
let's start from the 30 000 foot view

696
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,120
level it's really known that heat

697
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,440
it's well known that that heat uh

698
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,839
is a

699
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,519
factor that can pull out more yield in

700
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,038
terms of most compounds that you're

701
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,519
looking for

702
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,000
having said that you can also

703
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,720
use too much heat and destroy stuff you

704
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,319
know flavin flavonoids start to

705
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,278
polyphenols start to break ground around

706
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,119
140 to 160 depending on the polyphenol

707
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,599
terpenes as you know can be actually

708
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,199
much less than that

709
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,199
so

710
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,038
if you look at hot water versus cold

711
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,798
water extractions for example

712
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,400
marshmallow root right and i'm not

713
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,519
talking about craft marshmallows that

714
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,240
you throw on a yucky milk chocolate uh i

715
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,200
mean at least use dark chocolate um

716
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,278
you know

717
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,319
graham cracker and i'm talking about

718
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,839
actual althea alficianalas

719
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,960
cold extractions will pull out the

720
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,798
polysaccharides so it's believed

721
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,319
much better than a warm extraction and

722
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,558
if it's a hot extraction you've almost

723
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,798
destroyed the polysaccharide so for gut

724
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,319
relief the way people use it it really

725
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,558
needs to be a cold extraction or at

726
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:07,200
least that's a dogma in the industry i'd

727
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,278
like to do that study too

728
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,240
so it just depends on what you're after

729
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,119
right

730
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,640
hot versus cold and i'm going to throw

731
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,558
this out there because i this is

732
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,000
something that i don't believe but the

733
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,879
industry believes

734
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,359
and that is that if we use cold ethanol

735
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,240
we avoid um

736
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,918
we avoid uh chlorophyll

737
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,240
and chlorophyll gives it this accurate

738
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,399
taste well

739
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,240
you know if you can buy chlorophyll

740
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,839
liquid chlorophyll in the health food

741
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,440
store have you ever tasted that stuff it

742
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,879
is not acrid

743
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,038
and so

744
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,679
you know cannabinoids are accurate

745
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,558
so what is it that why are we so afraid

746
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,080
of chlorophyll i i i don't get it and if

747
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,158
somebody can explain that to me after

748
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,558
that would be great but i i don't

749
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,679
believe that cold ethanol

750
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,759
is effective at reducing uh chlorophyll

751
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,559
or maybe it is but

752
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,720
well let me rephrase that it may be

753
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,720
effective of reducing ethanol

754
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,200
to reduce and chlorophyll cold ethanol

755
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,839
may be effective reducing ethanol

756
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,880
but chlorophyll is not a bad thing that

757
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,879
that's what i don't believe

758
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,319
um so heat it just depends on what

759
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,320
you're doing

760
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,000
yep

761
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,779
and i'm rambling and it's time and i'm

762
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,920
going to call it quits thank you

763
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:28,920
[Applause]
