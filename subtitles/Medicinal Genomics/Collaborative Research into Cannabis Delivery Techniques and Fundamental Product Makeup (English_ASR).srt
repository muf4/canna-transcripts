1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,190
morning everyone thanks for coming I

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,589
have a stationary microphone so I can't

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,388
walk around the stage because I wanted

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,120
to point out that I've seen a few people

5
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:15,509
with like cannabis socks or t-shirts or

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,538
jewelry and I'm I don't have any of that

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:23,339
but I just want to point out I might not

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:25,800
have the nicest trousers but they're

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:30,539
made out of him so that's my knot to the

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,939
industry and they are made in Patagonia

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,420
which from Patagonia so this would down

12
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:39,299
the down the coastline here so getting

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:45,510
all the commercial tips yes so today I

14
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:47,669
am when when I applied to this to speak

15
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:49,589
here I wanted to talk about product

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,359
delivery like what what do you actually

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,980
consume because in the cannabis industry

18
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,019
you test for products but you don't

19
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,909
really test what what ends up with the

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,280
customer and I had the idea of doing

21
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:01,849
skin permeability tests and tell you how

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,780
much kit comes through the skin and

23
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,390
research always takes longer than it

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,210
should but the other aspect assimilation

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,049
all right there's a combustion of

26
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:11,548
vaporization of compounds so you don't

27
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,430
actually know what you consume if you

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:20,280
just test the oil or the the joint that

29
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:23,100
you do and this is far out point that

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,810
you apply to speak and you never know

31
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:26,158
where you get with your research or what

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,420
is the current topic so it turns out

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,670
this is really timely so we are focusing

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,250
today on the current research on vaping

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,040
and it's really the research only so

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,500
what is known and I try to stay away

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,490
from speculation but to make the point

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,109
that this is timely these were just a

39
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:49,828
few cutouts and screenshots that I

40
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:52,019
caught to make this talk and then a few

41
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:53,728
statistics behind it and it turns out I

42
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,280
had to send these slides on Friday so

43
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:59,519
everything is outdated so as I saw

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,460
yesterday we had 530 confirmed cases and

45
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:06,379
we had six death no eight eight death

46
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:08,848
now through the vaping pros a problem

47
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:10,530
there could also be the thought maybe we

48
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,598
didn't know what it was and we hadn't

49
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,829
seen it we had seen it but not realized

50
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,878
what it was but

51
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:20,579
from the reports that I read and the

52
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:23,429
literature that came out recently this

53
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:25,230
is new case or these are new symptoms so

54
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,159
it's not something overlooked but it's

55
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:31,318
something relatively new so everyone is

56
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:34,858
trying to figure out what it could be so

57
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:38,268
as far as I'm aware there's no single

58
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:42,239
course yet identified there are a few

59
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:44,370
ideas what it could be so I put up a few

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,709
molecules at the bottom so vitamin E

61
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,750
acetate is the the one that is highly

62
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:54,359
discussed now our particular through the

63
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:57,930
New York statements I also put up MCT

64
00:02:54,359 --> 00:03:01,260
oil it's another stretching agent in the

65
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:05,250
cannabis industry and then PG and VG

66
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,959
most more from the nicotine side because

67
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,489
anyone who done formulation in the

68
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,590
cannabis industry will realize they

69
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,438
don't actually mix with cannabis oil and

70
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,269
you will see a separation after a few

71
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:17,578
days so if you sell them quick you're

72
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:21,090
good but they will separate and then

73
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:24,989
just for popular request we have popcorn

74
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:29,009
lung here as well so diacetyl the

75
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:31,079
buttery flavor that is not yet seen in

76
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,608
the vaping in the cannabis industry but

77
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,449
at least in the bay or was in the vape

78
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:38,730
industry around and I point out all

79
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,760
these compounds are grass because I

80
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:44,658
heard this a lot over the last years

81
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,439
when they talked about vape oils

82
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:49,858
ingredients and it's like it's grass

83
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:53,128
it's safe it's good so I put up the

84
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:55,049
statement by FDA and I counted this four

85
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:58,798
times the word food and not a single

86
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,709
time the word smoking or inhalation

87
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:07,760
so these compounds are done for for

88
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:11,310
eating ingestion not for for smoking

89
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,918
thanks to some strong regulator strong

90
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:18,720
forces on the regulatory bodies there is

91
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:21,269
very little regulation on in on smoking

92
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,710
so that's the best we can go with right

93
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,360
on the grass side so on the grass side I

94
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:26,879
looked up on the FDA side we're

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,569
currently at 859 compounds that are on

96
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,019
the list

97
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:34,379
so grasp generally recognized it safe

98
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:36,000
so what is on the list or what used to

99
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,240
be on the list is trans-fats

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,040
so the list by itself is not perfect and

101
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,230
then secondly I went so I came here on

102
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,760
Sunday I came from a Hoover where it's

103
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,140
raining and it's cold and I came here

104
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,269
and it's sunny beautiful so I went

105
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,399
surfing in Malibu and if Baywatch told

106
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:53,269
us one thing it's not good to inhale sea

107
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,339
water but it's a grass compound so I

108
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:58,799
think I can make the point that grass is

109
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:00,839
not per se good and definitely not a

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,480
good idea for inhalation and then not

111
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,939
grass I looked it up because so many

112
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,759
people told me butan extraction is good

113
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,469
it's safe and if you inhale some butane

114
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,539
it's grass I looked it up it's not there

115
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,900
no butane or pentane or hydrocarbons

116
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:20,340
it's not mentioned so that's just the

117
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:22,620
side one on extraction so but focusing

118
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:27,060
on what I could find on the literature

119
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,889
about ingest or inhalation um and by the

120
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,050
way I will just ramble on because my

121
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:35,519
time I never started so we will just go

122
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:38,579
on till the afternoon one this no I

123
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,620
still not started anyway so I found one

124
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,589
paper from a German group they were

125
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:47,730
concerned with how much THC do you

126
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:50,819
inhale if you smoke a joint compared to

127
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:55,439
a DAB and I think that's an interesting

128
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:57,659
aspect to start with because so I

129
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,300
assumed this is can Matt so my audience

130
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,490
is mostly doctors so we are thinking

131
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,350
about how do we treat patients how do we

132
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,670
give anything to the patients how do we

133
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,070
even recommend what they should consume

134
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,830
so let's start with how much can of

135
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:14,519
cannabis or THC which even inhale if you

136
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:20,939
recommend a different consumption method

137
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:25,199
and so here are these rigged setups and

138
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:27,149
they they first showed that in smoking

139
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,909
and dabbing there's a complete

140
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:32,579
decarboxylation so even if you have any

141
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:35,430
THC acid in the product in the in your

142
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:39,300
product you consume you will inhale THC

143
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,980
there is no THC acid coming through and

144
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,650
then secondly and I

145
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:48,240
that we have to point out is you do not

146
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:50,120
inhale the gas or the vapor our

147
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,470
temperature of combustion or

148
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,470
vaporization you inhale something around

149
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,870
44 degrees on average maybe up to 60

150
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,920
degrees right no one can inhale and so

151
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:05,699
for you Americans that is 111 Fahrenheit

152
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:08,129
so you can you could not inhale anything

153
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:11,819
at 150 degrees Celsius that would just

154
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:14,550
burn your lungs literally and sight note

155
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,790
the boiling point of THC by the

156
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,889
literature if you do the conversion is

157
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:24,180
foreign and 25 degrees Celsius at one

158
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:26,159
atmosphere I've seen the number of 157

159
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,519
around a lot which is correct if you do

160
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,460
it at reduced pressure at five

161
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,289
millimeters of mercury but at one

162
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,509
atmosphere would be 450 and you

163
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,810
definitely do not inhale therefore any

164
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:42,269
THC vapor you would actually inhale

165
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,189
small goblets of oil that are coming

166
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:46,529
through so that's why you can't use

167
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,509
normal cigarette filters in Samoan

168
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:49,979
cannabis smoking because they would

169
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:53,670
catch all the oil droplets and you

170
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,890
wouldn't get anything and the

171
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:58,830
understanding that oil droplets are

172
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:01,110
inhaled is important for a second talk

173
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:02,990
that comes after the break by kaya when

174
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,490
he talks about heavy metals because

175
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:10,139
gaseous heavy metals is not what you're

176
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:12,509
inhaling either okay so next point the

177
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,300
other point was recovery or how much THC

178
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:18,509
you actually inhale and here in the

179
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,280
joint they smoke they got to say 27% of

180
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:23,610
the THC that was in the joint actually

181
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:27,569
ended up in the simulated lung and for

182
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,939
Devin you went at 75% recovery so if you

183
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:31,589
think about treating a patient and

184
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,330
you're switching them from joints to

185
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:35,039
DAB's you can't just take the math and

186
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,840
was like oh with that were a much THC

187
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,459
used to consume now you do a different

188
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,599
method we just used the same amount so

189
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:46,290
you have to adjust there but this study

190
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,879
had its limitations because it was a as

191
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:50,490
you can see on the picture a pre-rigged

192
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,620
system of how you inhale

193
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,139
they actually sucked the joint through

194
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,269
in one go they didn't do puff by puffs

195
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:02,360
so if we look at other research puffed

196
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:08,129
by puff studies this is a set of graphs

197
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:11,068
diagrams for nicotine inhalation I hope

198
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:13,499
you can read this all well so what these

199
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:16,289
graphs are showing is the nicotine

200
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:19,829
amount that is in the vapor per puff in

201
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:23,129
different methods so top right no sorry

202
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:25,289
top left is it's a vape cartridge so the

203
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,209
nicotine level stays consistent because

204
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:29,278
you have an oil you have a homogeneous

205
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:33,539
mixture you always get the same load

206
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:37,230
every puff but if you have these heat

207
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,909
not burn systems that's bottom left you

208
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,509
have a change in nicotine concentration

209
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:44,429
with every puff which is opposing to the

210
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:47,159
reference cigarette which is the bottom

211
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:51,628
right where the nicotine concentration

212
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:54,509
increases and the same principle

213
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:56,249
somewhat applies to smoking a joint so

214
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:58,379
that you start off with a low

215
00:09:56,249 --> 00:10:01,019
concentration of your active ingredient

216
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:05,100
and it slowly increases so here's a

217
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:07,860
study of smoking a spliff from Germany

218
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,199
so I had to learn what a spliff is and

219
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,870
in Europe they don't consume straight up

220
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:16,649
cannabis in a joint they use a spliff so

221
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:20,429
it's a a certain amount of nicotine of

222
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:23,938
tobacco together with cannabis now the

223
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:26,539
reasons for that are unknown to me it

224
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:29,188
might be that we have a less supply of

225
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:32,669
cannabis in Europe or that they're like

226
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:36,769
the nicotine aspect to it but what you

227
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:39,509
see is THC CBN so that's an all joint

228
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,919
and nicotine start off at low

229
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,379
concentration of the first puff and then

230
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:44,969
slowly increase the reason for that you

231
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,329
could think about it because the burning

232
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,579
of the joint or spliff is at the front

233
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:53,458
and it goes through the whole system

234
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:57,448
before you inhale so if anything burns

235
00:10:53,458 --> 00:11:00,659
and then goes through the system as an

236
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:02,729
droplet it might just be caught so while

237
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:05,159
it evaporates it never makes it to your

238
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,990
mouth it just gets caught and therefore

239
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,528
it's a buildup of higher nicotine and

240
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,649
THC concentration

241
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:13,208
on in the joint or spliff and then when

242
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:18,100
you get to that then you can inhale more

243
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:21,008
so that's why it's increasing but it's

244
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,240
not only THC nicotine and so on the

245
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:24,850
compounds you measure that you actually

246
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,269
inhale there are few more other

247
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:34,290
compounds that happen and are produced

248
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:38,769
when you vape or combust the material so

249
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:40,509
as a chemist this this slide is cool not

250
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:45,278
many chemists in the audience I guess so

251
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:46,980
just be scared so let's move on yeah so

252
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,480
he have a picture of a different setup

253
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,519
looks way more sophisticated than the

254
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,100
first setup so this is now from a third

255
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,370
group here this is actually from a group

256
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,680
in Portland and so they are hooking did

257
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,078
you see the terpene talk with GCMs

258
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,179
headspace analysis yesterday so that's

259
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:07,448
pretty cool that's very similar to this

260
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:11,758
so this is also the GCMs headspace so to

261
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:14,948
say where they smoke a cannabis sample

262
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:18,308
inhale it into the GCMs and then measure

263
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:19,929
in the MS what comes out and while I

264
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:21,899
already early on mentioned there are

265
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:24,429
limitations to all studies are present

266
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,438
in Germany they had a police officer

267
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:27,909
standing there watching the spliff while

268
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:30,159
it gets smoked so that it doesn't get

269
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:33,100
lost because that was a cannabis spliff

270
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:38,019
they found of someone when they busted

271
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:40,089
him here in the US you can't get any

272
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:43,389
cannabis products into a university and

273
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:45,819
do some research on it so what they did

274
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:47,948
was they bought a milligram of THC in

275
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:51,759
reference standard evaporated solvent

276
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:53,678
put that milligram onto a test tube or

277
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,449
so and then smoke that milligram and

278
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:58,389
then looked at what compounds actually

279
00:12:55,448 --> 00:13:02,889
came out and it was not only THC so this

280
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:06,068
is pure THC being vaporized and inhaled

281
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:08,669
into the GCMs and so we see isoprene

282
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:14,049
units we see formaldehyde we see other

283
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:16,628
ketones we see aromatic systems on the

284
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:20,338
other scale so this already looks

285
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:22,360
complex and and you can point out a few

286
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,570
potential

287
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,100
for substances coming out but if you

288
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,129
have a real cannabis sample and we're

289
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,959
jumping back to the German group here

290
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:34,659
they're way more compounds in there if

291
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:39,009
you have cannabis because and I think I

292
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:41,019
pointed that out or not I didn't so way

293
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:43,569
more complex coming out and there you

294
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,990
can now also see the parent THC compound

295
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:50,490
and CBN compound so let's point out a

296
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:54,639
few compounds isoprene unit bottom-left

297
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:57,009
it's the mother of all terpenes so they

298
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,899
basically just while isoprene built

299
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:01,539
terpenes and then eventually can

300
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:04,839
cannabinoids when you combust them or

301
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:07,958
heat them they can go back and then some

302
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:11,430
car carcinogenic aromatic compounds what

303
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:14,859
we have to point out is that

304
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:17,979
cannabinoids trophies are similar

305
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,690
similar about our synthetic heritage and

306
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,310
secondly with the motor pins they are

307
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,399
the more volatile organic compounds you

308
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:29,018
have so the more stuff can happen and

309
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:32,350
can be formed so if you then take it a

310
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:35,198
little deeper and you now look at a few

311
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,290
harmful compounds and wonder how are

312
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:41,409
they produced at different consumption

313
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:45,549
methods so we have a dabbing so of pure

314
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:48,399
THC THC terpene mixture so this is snd

315
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:51,099
tap and then vaporization and different

316
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,980
voltages so voltages here are stand and

317
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,579
basically for the temperature of the

318
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:02,050
heating element the more electricity you

319
00:14:57,578 --> 00:15:04,809
run through it the hotter it gets it's

320
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,729
not the perfect system because all

321
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:09,369
batteries or heating elements are

322
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,370
slightly different but it gives you a

323
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,679
good indication and those numbers

324
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,629
basically indicate the more voltage you

325
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:19,299
sent through the vaporization mechanism

326
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:22,899
the more of those decomposition products

327
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:25,269
you get and if you do dabs you really

328
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,480
have a lot of those your dabs are in

329
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:31,929
temperatures considerably higher than

330
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:35,940
any of your vaporization methods and

331
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:35,939
then on the risk factors

332
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,430
you cannot try to do like a theoretical

333
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,980
calculation of how risky it is to do a

334
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:49,000
consumption method like how bad could it

335
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:54,459
be this is not an absolute mesh measure

336
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,059
and it's based on data that is in the

337
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:59,889
best case indicative of real consumption

338
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:02,889
because these are based on consumption

339
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:08,230
methods on a machine right the GCMs we

340
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:09,939
saw &amp; sfd a no not after a an ash '''l

341
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,060
sigh a National Institute of Science

342
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,740
pointed out there is currently no

343
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:19,719
indication that cannabis smoking or

344
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:22,060
vaping actually leads to lung cancer so

345
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,720
they are good for comparison not for

346
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:28,419
absolutes so here are the numbers the H

347
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,389
I is for non cancer risk and the e-a-l

348
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:34,509
e-r is for cancer risk and when you look

349
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:38,078
at the numbers you see that's smoking

350
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:40,149
flower you know is potentially the most

351
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:43,088
harmful because you have a combustion of

352
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:45,539
plant material with a lot of compounds

353
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:48,459
that you could potentially ingest inhale

354
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:51,939
and then we go down the list dabbing and

355
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:54,789
then low-voltage vaping would be the

356
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,920
potentially less risk for doesn't mean

357
00:16:54,789 --> 00:17:00,129
that any of them are leading to cancer

358
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:04,049
or that none of them lead to cancer it's

359
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:07,299
just a comparison between the methods

360
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:09,609
and then another slide I could add to

361
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:12,609
this was one of the reports I saw there

362
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:17,379
talked about synthetic cannabinoids as

363
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:19,808
an agent in CBD vape cartridges CBD is

364
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,829
currently the craze the supply of CBD

365
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:27,039
might not be as high as as it has to to

366
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:29,859
cover all the the demand so people were

367
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,450
using other cannabinoids to stretch or

368
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,740
synthetic cannabinoids and I want to

369
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,700
point out as a chemist there's a

370
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:38,609
difference between synthesized THC and a

371
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,110
synthesized synthetic cannabinoid

372
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:44,349
they're not the same thing so synthetic

373
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:46,659
cannabinoids he's shown on the left by

374
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:49,419
basically one of the godfathers of the

375
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,600
thing from John Hoffman

376
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,940
from Clemson University these were

377
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:57,429
molecules made to target the

378
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,250
endocannabinoid system so they designed

379
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,500
molecules that would hook onto a cb1

380
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:05,650
receptor in a petri dish and shut it off

381
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,779
to give a a perfect response write these

382
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:10,150
things bind and don't leave they were

383
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:13,629
never designed to actually be consumed

384
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:16,810
by humans because they are full agonist

385
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,630
or totally our super agonists while THC

386
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:21,490
or CBD shown here a partial agonist so

387
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,670
they actually leave your brain at some

388
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,690
point again so I just wanted to point

389
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,410
this out

390
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,420
it is often miscommunicated in the

391
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,590
English in the industry under or

392
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,120
misunderstood in the industry and

393
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:37,059
miscommunicated in the press that

394
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:40,349
synthetic cannabinoids and cannabis at

395
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:40,349
like two different worlds

396
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:46,619
I think spices they're referred to as

397
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:51,430
spices and baths also synthetic opioids

398
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:55,059
both are available at your local gas

399
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,710
station so I just want to point out

400
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:00,779
again some of the limitations so this

401
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:04,269
research is all very early on the

402
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:08,470
availability of real samples to do tests

403
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:09,940
are limited I know Kyle will talk about

404
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,559
some research he actually did on real

405
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,850
samples if you do a bit of a

406
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:17,919
non-official university study that is

407
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:20,230
possible but if you do go through the

408
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,880
normal routes it gets a bit more

409
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:28,000
complicated and then another problem

410
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,190
seems like a missing collaboration of

411
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,259
different actors so Health Canada is

412
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,640
interested in this universities are

413
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:35,559
interested in this producers are

414
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,410
interested but somehow they don't really

415
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,480
work together so everyone starts from

416
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,920
scratch and builds it up themselves it

417
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,130
would really help if people would work

418
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:51,550
together and allocate resources and

419
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:54,430
potential a better so I have a few

420
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:56,859
minutes so let me plug my company so our

421
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,980
idea is fundamental collaboration so we

422
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:01,809
are Research Institute or research

423
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,860
facility that is full aware that we

424
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,139
don't understand everything

425
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:06,909
so I'm a chemist so I showed you the

426
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,179
molecules I have no idea what they do on

427
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:12,700
a body but for that I have friends that

428
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:16,059
know that aspect and I have friends that

429
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,970
know how to formulate VAP products or

430
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:21,759
other products so we try to collaborate

431
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:27,370
as much as possible so as I said our

432
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:29,440
focus is on cannabis chemistry and to to

433
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:31,089
point out this collaborative aspect and

434
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,240
be understanding that we don't know

435
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:37,480
everything my team started to compile a

436
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,058
list of compounds that are known in the

437
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,339
cannabis plant and we slowly start

438
00:20:40,058 --> 00:20:44,470
adding decomposition products like CBN

439
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:46,509
that are not naturally occurring but are

440
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,279
found in cannabis production so that we

441
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:51,879
can then start tracking them and then

442
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,490
stop signing values of interest to them

443
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,690
so in our case we start tracking

444
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,370
molecular weight melting point

445
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,500
solubility in different compound

446
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:02,399
different solvents and so on and so

447
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:05,048
forth so we have 24 compound categories

448
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,940
over seminar on compounds I know we can

449
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:12,039
get to a thousand let's just give it

450
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:14,230
some time why we have 75 cannabinoids on

451
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,839
our list I know professor Mary who I

452
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,610
very much admire has more already in his

453
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:22,058
list but we were slowly trying to catch

454
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:23,798
up we had 400 terpenes thus yesterday we

455
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:27,428
had like 200 terpenes so I have you beat

456
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:29,470
on that and then the other aspect is

457
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,120
this database is available to

458
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,740
collaborate so if you have some datasets

459
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,269
that you want to add to it and if you

460
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,029
want to get some other data sets that we

461
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:39,789
have get out of it we are very happy to

462
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:41,440
collaborate please reach out to us I

463
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:44,649
want to have this list field as quickly

464
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,840
as possible so that we can have our

465
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,030
metabolomics database of cannabis

466
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:51,269
related compounds I know they're

467
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:55,298
existing for other research fields and

468
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:58,119
with that I have to thank the authors

469
00:21:55,298 --> 00:22:00,579
and researchers on the on the work I

470
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:02,259
presented and the collaborators that

471
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:06,159
helped me make sure that you slice all

472
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:08,109
accurate and I put up one of the email

473
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,669
addresses of the PhD student that did a

474
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:11,019
lot of the inhalation studies because

475
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:12,610
though you will have questions that I

476
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:14,918
cannot answer so please put his name

477
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:16,719
email address down and reach out to him

478
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,780
also if you want to

479
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,360
lights they're up on my website I upload

480
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:24,460
them all on SlideShare so you don't have

481
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:26,918
to take as many pictures of those slides

482
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,600
then talking about pictures I don't know

483
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,970
why they put this picture of me in there

484
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:34,329
it's not the best one at least it points

485
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,308
out that I like to ride bikes and here

486
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:39,250
these were the people that took the

487
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:41,349
pictures of me and that helped me

488
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,079
through this so this is my current oh

489
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:47,408
it's actually my former coop crop I'm

490
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,119
faculty at UBC so I get access to quite

491
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:52,200
a lot of motivated students that come

492
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,849
through my lab on a four month basis

493
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,950
they do they're one of their semesters

494
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:59,168
they have to work for a real company so

495
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,529
I pretend to be a real company I work

496
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:04,690
for me so some of them have now changed

497
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:06,639
and I have now a new set of people I'd

498
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,850
add a statistician to the team so that

499
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,400
we can get our numbers run better and

500
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:15,459
with that thank you very much for

501
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,409
listening and if there are any questions

502
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,110
I think we have time during the now

503
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:22,240
break before we all move over and listen

504
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:25,709
to Kyle's talk about heavy metals and

505
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,710
bed cartridges thank you

506
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:39,120
any questions yes

507
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,550
yes so the question was are there more

508
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:55,019
compounds you inhale with you smoke a

509
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:58,859
joint versus if you if you a vape and

510
00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:01,019
oil I would very much say so yes

511
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:02,699
first there are more compounds initially

512
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,759
that you could even inhale and then

513
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,850
using combustion always produces way

514
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:14,220
more compounds down the line then just

515
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:15,929
vaporizing them so the the one of the

516
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,180
studies I showed you was actually on

517
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,190
German material combusted so there were

518
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,080
there was a plethora and they were way

519
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,049
more compounds they from there versus

520
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:29,669
vaporizing and I hope next year I can

521
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:34,200
add my own data to this Oh beneficial

522
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:35,730
company I have benefited so I don't know

523
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,410
generally if they're good about the

524
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,410
compound so I can't really answer this

525
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:45,559
then come Derrick actually comes back

526
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,810
more to my expertise of extraction I

527
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,970
would say that most extraction artists

528
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,559
don't really know how to extract so they

529
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,410
might leave behind a lot of compounds

530
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,960
that should be in the oil so generally I

531
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,610
would say the oils you inhale that I

532
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,650
available on the market of lesser

533
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:06,299
quality than they should be if you would

534
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:08,250
in if you would extract correctly also

535
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,809
we all are really happy about the

536
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:21,599
synergistic effect and then we use

537
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:23,399
distillate so like pick one okay what's

538
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,339
the correct extraction so we're veering

539
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,220
off my just presented topic and I we are

540
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:30,839
getting to the stuff I really like so my

541
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,390
argument is you have compounds in the

542
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:36,000
styling material and you want to get all

543
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:39,030
of them out and none of the others you

544
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,670
didn't want so if you have to clean up

545
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:42,750
your extract with winterization and

546
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,930
distillation you didn't extract

547
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,849
correctly and if you're producing if you

548
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,460
if you have 10% yield on a 20 percent

549
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:52,049
THC flower you also didn't extract

550
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,019
correctly because you left a lot behind

551
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:57,769
or lost it during the process so that's

552
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,769
a short answer

553
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:22,149
yeah I lost my slide so yeah so nicotine

554
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,950
can't break down into benzene because

555
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:27,490
there's no benzene moiety in the

556
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,200
molecule is that not said if there any

557
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,529
other compounds that that could produce

558
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,720
benzene that is beyond the reading I've

559
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:38,740
done I don't know the exact formulations

560
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:42,039
of nicotine based products interesting

561
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,460
aspect but I don't have any answer to

562
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,460
that right now

563
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:48,119
there were another question

564
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:26,649
yes yes you have to be a course I don't

565
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,170
know I have to admit I don't know so the

566
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,910
reading I did for this presentation and

567
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,240
the research was based on like which

568
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:36,940
compounds come through how they get then

569
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:40,109
bio-dad goes into a direction that I'm

570
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:42,940
not really qualified to to talk about

571
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:45,189
there is the understanding that the

572
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,820
smaller droplets are faster absorbed I

573
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:52,570
guess I'm hoping to nodding head I think

574
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:56,049
there was a nodding head so it's I'm

575
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:58,210
trying I'm trying to hook up a particle

576
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:01,690
size analyzer to my vape machine right

577
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:06,059
now so that I can actually start doing

578
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:06,059
that work but we're not there yet

579
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:53,270
so for the study that was the GCMs study

580
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,740
that I showed you yes that would be

581
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:57,319
vaporization because they're putting

582
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,700
pure THC in a comp in an inner tube so

583
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,079
they're not putting that into a vape

584
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,919
cartridge they only have a milligram of

585
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:05,389
it as I said there are limitations to

586
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,850
all these studies that are currently out

587
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,650
there because no one yet has gone to a

588
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:11,928
dispensary bought a vape cartridge

589
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:14,390
hooked it up to their personal battery

590
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,690
and then put it into a machine and check

591
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,690
that it

592
00:29:56,109 --> 00:30:01,069
yeah so I don't know the answer I'm I'm

593
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:03,619
aware of the question so that that's why

594
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:06,439
I said I want to hook up a particle size

595
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:09,789
analyzer to the study so ask me next

596
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,789
year and I give you some data back

597
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:18,029
did everyone hear this Monica has a loud

598
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,799
voice she was one of the people that I

599
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:21,539
mentioned in the slides because she

600
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:24,029
knows a lot more about vaping

601
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,980
specifically than me

602
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:28,200
I kept ignoring one follow-up question

603
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:40,110
here on the front do you still want to

604
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:41,819
ask this yes so I had this slide earlier

605
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:44,159
but there was on nicotine site so he'd

606
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:46,230
not burn is exactly that you have flour

607
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,090
in a in a compartment you can either

608
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,569
have a prong that sticks into it that's

609
00:32:48,089 --> 00:32:55,099
the I cost or you have like a pot like a

610
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:58,829
small jar of ceramic and you put your

611
00:32:55,099 --> 00:33:00,419
flour in there so yes they behave very

612
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:04,529
different to normal nicotine cigarettes

613
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:08,610
as I showed for the prong size not seen

614
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:10,079
any data on cannabis itself for that but

615
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:15,149
it's definitely the interesting thing to

616
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:18,569
build and it has already been built if I

617
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:20,310
look in the right direction so I'm sure

618
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:21,619
packs would be happy to discuss that

619
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:25,829
aren't there

620
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:28,039
stand at the expo one quick question on

621
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:28,039
the back

622
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:52,320
I live in Vancouver Canada I'm just

623
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:55,230
happy that I'm not in the US so no I'd

624
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,418
like a private research lab will never

625
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:00,450
have the capability to of figuring out

626
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:03,090
what the reason for an epidemic is we

627
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:06,390
don't have access except access to

628
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:09,358
enough samples so we can't do this what

629
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:12,148
will be our focus is helping producers

630
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,259
in the future to design their vape oils

631
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:20,069
and hardware so that the inhalation

632
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:23,220
leads to or that at inhalation you have

633
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:26,190
a desirable molecular profile whatever

634
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:29,069
that will be but figuring out what an

635
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:32,280
epidemic is caused by you can't be done

636
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,590
by a private research lab if they want

637
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,649
to send me samples and I'll look at it

638
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:53,940
maybe but I leave that to the

639
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:55,409
professionals I don't have a time we all

640
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,858
have to make it to the heavy metal talk

641
00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:00,599
so thank you very much again and just

642
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:02,989
find me in the corridor afterwards if

643
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,319
you have further questions

644
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:06,319
[Applause]
