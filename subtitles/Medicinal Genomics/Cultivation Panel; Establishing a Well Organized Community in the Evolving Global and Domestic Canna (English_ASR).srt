1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,580
community it's an indispensable

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,318
component of any successful business

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,429
cannabis included networking

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:14,339
collaboration in strategic partnerships

5
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:16,019
and the evolution of our industry this

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,890
conference has demonstrated the dynamic

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:21,210
reality of shifting social attitudes and

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,939
greater acceptance of the medical

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,039
efficacy of cannabis by the scientific

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,460
and medical communities the need to work

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,480
together though is greater than ever

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,759
hyper-competitive attitudes only serve

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,710
the needs of a selective view in

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,929
actuality we operate in the nage of

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,179
unprecedented information sharing to

16
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,399
that end can med is notably created a

17
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,320
space to share cannabis information in a

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,600
very meaningful way we all appreciate

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,719
this opportunity today and that mission

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,429
that are honored to be speaking here in

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,090
our work community literally starts from

22
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,850
the ground up

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,949
nature crafts complex ecosystems that we

24
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,899
growers nurture this Raisa soma

25
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,878
ecosystem forms the base community that

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,340
supports everything else that we do as

27
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,228
an industry this panel was formed to

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,290
discuss the intricacies inherent in the

29
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:09,269
simple concept of community gentlemen

30
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,570
it's great to have you here today thank

31
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:15,000
you very much great to be here we all

32
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:18,298
have impacted our collective cannabis

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,739
community in very different ways so to

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,630
have an opportunity to assemble you all

35
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,629
in one place is really really special

36
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:26,429
again thank you for being here each of

37
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,519
us represents a thread in the communal

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,290
fabric that is cannabis can man has

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,700
helped reinforced the importance of

40
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,350
establishing a dynamic cannabis

41
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,799
community and I welcome regimen

42
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:42,209
David Big Mike and Jason to discuss that

43
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,600
very subject today so you start off you

44
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,500
guys well you know when we first started

45
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,228
we're in the black market

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,060
okay and the community was very limited

47
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,489
to who we could talk to and who do we

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,740
could speak to in fact we kind of had a

49
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:58,109
closed-off mindset when it came to that

50
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,519
kind of thing because we didn't know if

51
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,649
they were the man or we're gonna be

52
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,890
going to jail well now it's a whole

53
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,840
different world out there and we must

54
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,179
work together the more that I

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,939
collaborate the more that I meet people

56
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,110
and I talk to them this is how things

57
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,030
get done in today

58
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,010
society now look you gonna have to go be

59
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,650
like your secret secret trade stuff out

60
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:22,079
but there's this community now that's

61
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,640
out there that's open and willing to

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,490
discuss things and we should embrace

63
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,619
that we want to get things done we want

64
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,230
to move this industry faster it's gonna

65
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,599
be collaboration personally I like to

66
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:35,879
talk to everyone and anyone that I can

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,310
that can help out and that I can help

68
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,269
them in sharing information that you

69
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,400
might come in from the cultivation

70
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,840
coming from the cultivation side you

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
know in the black market days nobody

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,810
wanted to share any of their secrets you

73
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,659
wanted to keep you know your special

74
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,580
sauce in there as we're expanding and

75
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,709
starting larger scale cultivation

76
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,600
centers and then what will be acres and

77
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,950
acres of cannabis cultivation we're all

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,810
gonna deal with the same problem same

79
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:03,329
powdery mildew botrytis for sehri and

80
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,949
things like that these problems are not

81
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,360
necessarily in the secret sauce these

82
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,560
are problems that all of us have to deal

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,560
with and that all of us should work

84
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,659
together on and figure out safe and

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,689
effective treatments for these problems

86
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,639
as well as you know just building a team

87
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:23,489
in a community throughout this cannabis

88
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:26,939
industry David so I guess I'm here to

89
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,939
represent academia and so for me

90
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,370
academia needs to work and and Hanan

91
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,469
with the industry so that's one thing

92
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,200
for sure and then the other thing is

93
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:38,789
that right now so I'm from Canada so of

94
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,219
course things that are a little bit

95
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,590
different but a lot of companies are

96
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:46,259
paying like our developing research

97
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,299
project with academia to do things but

98
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,599
they want to keep everything secret so a

99
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,519
lot of money is wasted because like the

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,709
same research is done by a lot of

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,110
different groups separately so if we

102
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,549
would work more together like networking

103
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,840
and like a collaborative competition or

104
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:05,840
computational collaboration I'm not sure

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,360
how to call it but anyway it would be

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,640
way better for the industry move faster

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,040
because no money would be wasted on

108
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,548
replicating the same experiments over

109
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:22,889
and over in different groups thank you

110
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:25,479
graduate I think for me it's been a

111
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:29,709
little different as a scientist you know

112
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,660
we publish that's how we do things right

113
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:33,279
and the publish or perish thing is a

114
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,950
very real thing even in the cannabis

115
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,659
industry because we have investors who

116
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,000
are like well you know why are we paying

117
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,060
you all this R&amp;D money if if nobody

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,629
knows what we're doing right so but I do

119
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,550
understand that we've had a huge

120
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:50,019
evolution of what community means

121
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,699
because when I came into the industry

122
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:54,849
and I tried to start to talk to some of

123
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,469
the underground breeders said hey what

124
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,470
about sequencing let's study your

125
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,740
genetics that was not a very popular

126
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:06,190
thing right so but it's come a long way

127
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,160
right and and I think now you know just

128
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:11,709
recently me and my team published a

129
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,100
paper on the chirping you know new genes

130
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:19,149
in cannabis and I think you know if we

131
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,220
had not been a community minded like

132
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:23,769
organization that would have been held

133
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,470
behind and patented right so I think it

134
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:29,319
is really important for for academia

135
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:32,350
industry for the industry to understand

136
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,819
that we get further along in our common

137
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,950
goal because we do have a common goal

138
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:37,599
right and that common goal is keeping

139
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,639
the industry to ourselves and not having

140
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,939
big AG or whatever come and take it from

141
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,149
us I think as long as we keep that in

142
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,449
mind

143
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:49,209
community kind of falls into place so

144
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:52,449
totally and I think for me the fear was

145
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:54,399
when I got started that my community

146
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,560
would ultimately end up being jailed if

147
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,049
I were to be caught or we work too

148
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,519
closely together it collaborated so to

149
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,790
say that we've come a long way there's

150
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,799
an understatement I also feel that if we

151
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,300
don't collaborate if you if you're one

152
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,129
of those people who want to hold on to

153
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,370
all your secrets you're gonna get left

154
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:16,060
behind and your secrets are gonna leave

155
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,800
with you too thanks guys how do you see

156
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,660
the relationship between microbial and

157
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,120
fungal communities as they relate to

158
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,980
overall plant health what is investment

159
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,329
in a healthy and vital roses crisis

160
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,430
normal community translate you know our

161
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:30,490
life period

162
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:32,949
listen microbes are so important there

163
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,829
would be no trees no grass no prairies

164
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,329
if it wasn't for beneficial microbes and

165
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,800
when you talk about fungal

166
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,449
I don't know who did the study but they

167
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,090
did a study where they used radioactive

168
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:46,750
isotopes and they wanted to check out

169
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:49,389
the soil web in these trees and so they

170
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,670
fed the one tree and to their amazement

171
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:54,310
none of the isotopes were in that tree

172
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:57,610
they were in a tree four hundred yards

173
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,040
away and then there is another tree a

174
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,030
hundred yards away another 140 class

175
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,379
they're sending and they're

176
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,599
communicating with each other and

177
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:05,829
they're putting in the vital nutrients

178
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,080
and what they're looking for for

179
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:11,979
survival and they're helping each other

180
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:14,189
out in that forest it's extremely

181
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,530
important nothing lives without microbes

182
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:19,209
plants no community I really do think

183
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:21,729
the cannabis industry is going to be

184
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:24,669
driving the study of this now that we

185
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,170
have the funding and the the desire to

186
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,730
see this I think cannabis right now is

187
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,170
in its infancy what we're really doing

188
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,120
right now is just trying to out-compete

189
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,100
the bad we're putting our back Phyllis's

190
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,120
that our bacillus is in there GLIAC

191
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,950
ladies um

192
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,139
Pseudomonas is in there to out-compete

193
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,639
but we're really not sure which one of

194
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,289
these is the most effective right now

195
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,159
and I think it's going to require a lot

196
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,300
of bomb a lot of research and a lot of

197
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,700
science behind it that you know the

198
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,170
growers see see the cause and effect and

199
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,529
we see the benefits of these but we

200
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:55,000
don't know exactly which is doing the

201
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:56,559
most there and which is specific

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,319
cannabis and which is just specific to

203
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,560
out competing other detrimental

204
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:05,110
detrimental of biologicals interesting

205
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,480
so you know it's interesting because

206
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,129
there is a whole set of terpene genes

207
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,920
that are only expressed in the roots

208
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:15,579
right so clearly there is communication

209
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,100
between the plant and the soil so that

210
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,349
communication is there for a reason the

211
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,840
the terpenes that get expressed in the

212
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,620
roots are likely and they're mostly

213
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,699
monoterpenes so they are able to be

214
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,780
volatilized and spread easily in the

215
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,729
soil right so that means that there's

216
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:33,279
some sort of conditioning or attraction

217
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,680
repellent reno repellent kind of thing

218
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,169
going on where the plant is

219
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,539
communicating to the soil what it needs

220
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:43,319
and in response the soil is providing it

221
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,639
with the nutrients and also the

222
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,790
beneficial microbes that are helping

223
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:50,090
that's that life cycle you know progress

224
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:52,969
right so the

225
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,490
is communication that does it's a living

226
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:59,990
mat right from the soil up to the planet

227
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,610
it's one big living organism so I think

228
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,850
to make the link with the first question

229
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,889
again it's it's one place where I mean

230
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,330
we need to see the results from all the

231
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:12,289
different groups that are working in

232
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,300
that aspect so there was Daniel and ryx

233
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:15,919
that we're showing is results my group

234
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:18,528
is doing similar thing about playing

235
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,209
with the microbiome of cannabis curry

236
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:23,149
there's a lot of improvements that can

237
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,379
be done in that area for sure I think

238
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,000
there's a lot of research we still need

239
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:27,799
to do to understand the relationships

240
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,839
between the microbes the fungi in the

241
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,609
overall plant health but one thing that

242
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,380
we can all agree on is they're linked

243
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,409
there's definitely a strong relationship

244
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:38,509
with a healthy community their mandatory

245
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,250
testing boy that's been a hot button

246
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:41,659
issue in the last couple years hasn't it

247
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,100
how do you guys interact with the

248
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,838
regulatory bodies that govern how you

249
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,278
operate your business and you ever run

250
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,410
into trouble and how do you feel about

251
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:50,720
mandatory testing well I love mandatory

252
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:54,409
testing third parties that that cannot

253
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,720
be bought or corrupted we need to go

254
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:59,360
through another kind of cycle of testing

255
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,790
where we have labs that are just they're

256
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,289
there to help the community make sure

257
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:08,269
that safe products are going out and

258
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:10,279
they can't be bought so yeah I would

259
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:13,069
agree with that as well mandatory

260
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:16,250
testing we need it we need safe products

261
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,200
out there what we do need is is

262
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,789
standards you know lots of labs have

263
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,980
different standards lots of labs have

264
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:23,480
different techniques we need mandated

265
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,970
standards so that we get consistent

266
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,970
results through any lab that you use on

267
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,320
I know in Colorado there's a game to be

268
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,600
played especially when it comes to

269
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,080
potency testing some labs will give you

270
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,459
better results than others and we also

271
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,810
know that you can take the same sample

272
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,579
and test it in three different methods

273
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:42,799
and get three different on three

274
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,200
different results with it so really

275
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,028
standardizing standardizing the way that

276
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,850
these third-party labs test and then you

277
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:50,870
know making sure that there is some

278
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,250
governing bodies that make sure that

279
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,839
these companies are not bought out or

280
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,039
that you're not paying extra to get you

281
00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:02,270
know that a couple percent your THC

282
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:04,179
potencies so for me in Canada I guess

283
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:07,490
it's a little bit different but

284
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:09,679
like for me I I think that there could

285
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,750
be exception to mandatory testing for

286
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,539
people like me doing research like I'm

287
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,460
not selling any product I mean I so to

288
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:19,370
me it like sometime it does not make

289
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,500
sense that I'm required to do like to

290
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,110
have my my product tested even though I

291
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,059
just wanted to you know weight them and

292
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,600
have an idea of it did I get an

293
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:32,029
improvement using that experiment so I I

294
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,440
understand that like for companies it's

295
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:36,259
it's something that should stay like

296
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,890
that but for research I I think there

297
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:40,250
should be some like exceptions that's my

298
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,539
point

299
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:48,889
I don't know if I should speak on this

300
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:54,289
coming from a lab previously I recuse

301
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:56,779
myself from this one so but you know if

302
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:58,279
we're gonna treat it like a medicine if

303
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,480
we're gonna call it a medicine it should

304
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,000
be treated like a medicine and so that's

305
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,440
a lot to say on that one so 20% I've

306
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,200
been operating in Arizona for the last

307
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,500
decade and we got mandatory testing like

308
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,390
last week and up until this point the

309
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,809
onus of responsibility has been up to

310
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:17,149
dispensary owners and cultivators to

311
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,250
maintain standards of purity and as a

312
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:22,009
result patients and suffered Aspergillus

313
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,139
powdery mildew black toxic mold they've

314
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,909
all made it out onto the into the

315
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:28,789
patient scene and as a result people

316
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:31,009
have gotten sick so people have died

317
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,629
right so this is this is no [ __ ]

318
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:34,939
right people have died from

319
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:37,309
aspergillosis and other things like that

320
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,770
right so you know it's not the cannabis

321
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:42,589
that's killing them but it's bad

322
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:45,230
cannabis that when put into the wrong

323
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,259
body creates a bad situation right so

324
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,970
and and for that reason alone again if

325
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:51,110
it's if we're gonna use it as medicine

326
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,580
that should be treated like medicine

327
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,500
well I think you're right you have

328
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,210
individuals that are so profit focused

329
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,980
that they'll sacrifice the well-being of

330
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,259
their patients to bring a product to

331
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,750
market and that's why third-party

332
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:04,580
testing and so mandatory thank you very

333
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,750
much let's chat about the value of

334
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,210
networking how do you feel about

335
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,850
collaboration versus competition about

336
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,810
co-branding global distribution change

337
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,730
and research between nations and

338
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:16,859
global partners that have similar

339
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,700
cannabis legislation to our own or

340
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,840
enhanced legislation like Canadians I

341
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,379
think in today's cannabis world

342
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,590
collaboration is a must there there's so

343
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:31,259
much competition out there and we need

344
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,210
to get together in groups of the

345
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,429
smartest people and collaborate who know

346
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,050
what they're doing and make superior

347
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:39,199
products for the patients that are out

348
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:41,189
there collaboration is extremely

349
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,320
important in today's day and age

350
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:46,180
especially coming out of a black market

351
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,920
where we didn't collaborate with people

352
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:52,349
[Applause]

353
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:54,360
once again from the cultivation side as

354
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,850
we get more and more into this and we

355
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,470
progress further along we're starting to

356
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,420
find that you need to really specialize

357
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,759
in areas you know your breeder needs to

358
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:04,799
be a specialist

359
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,600
even your propagators and your your your

360
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,789
Fino hunters need to be specialists on

361
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,620
this and well a lot of the early

362
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:12,329
emerging markets were required to be

363
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,339
vertically integrated now as some of

364
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:17,730
those requirements are going away

365
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:19,320
there's no way around joining forces

366
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,060
with other teams and with other

367
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,310
companies that may have a specialty that

368
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,199
you don't possess otherwise you know

369
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,000
years will be wasted in research that

370
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,350
someone else has already done just by

371
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,210
not sharing it so I'm lucky enough to be

372
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,149
from a province where the government

373
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:39,300
actually created an office that is

374
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:40,799
responsible to build that cannabis

375
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,229
industry in the province so they're

376
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,449
trying to link the industry with the

377
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,550
academia and and third-party testing

378
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,350
agency and the health authorities so and

379
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:51,779
they're traveling to word trying to lure

380
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,690
companies to New Brunswick so it's very

381
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:56,279
nice to see that but we're almost the

382
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,080
only province that has that and I hope

383
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,819
at some point the other will will follow

384
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,300
our steps and that you will have the

385
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,820
same here in the u.s. once it's

386
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:09,539
legalized but the other point I'm I'm

387
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:12,320
gonna raise here is that I would also

388
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,939
like to see more collaboration between

389
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,270
Canada and the US because since it's

390
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,070
legal on our side of the country or off

391
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,439
the border there's a lot of things we

392
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,379
can do that you cannot do now so you

393
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,220
know by playing together then maybe you

394
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,220
can act come

395
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,330
there's more and get ready quicker for

396
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,860
when it's gonna be legal here I think

397
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,570
the ultimate collaboration will be when

398
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,789
we can actually start to ship stuff

399
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,440
across borders and it's what one big

400
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:42,750
global economy and I think that's what

401
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,970
ultimately we have to go for and the

402
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,509
only way you do that is to get back to

403
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,610
standards and a oneness right you you

404
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:52,919
need to have some governing body that

405
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,509
steps in and says this is the way we

406
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,159
have to do it so that the labs are

407
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:58,230
performing the same way and so that

408
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,529
everybody has the same target and then

409
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:05,190
we don't have 87 different freaking like

410
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:07,709
you know regulations because they test

411
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:11,100
for 22 pesticides but they test for 104

412
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:13,650
pesticides right so you know human human

413
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,649
safety is not a commodity and and all

414
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:18,689
humans suffer from the same things more

415
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,279
or less right so I don't understand why

416
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,830
there are different regulations in the

417
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,179
first place it seems to me when you have

418
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:28,560
different regulations you're saying that

419
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:30,120
some people are more or less susceptible

420
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,629
to certain things and other people which

421
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,230
is a crock of [ __ ] right so can I say

422
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:39,480
that we're not on TV right so you know

423
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,009
so I think that's what we really need to

424
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,389
strive for in the industry and and I

425
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:45,090
think it has to come from in the

426
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:47,699
industry right if we wait for the USDA

427
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:49,160
or the European Union or whoever to do

428
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,530
it and they're gonna come down with

429
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:55,110
regulations that we don't like and I

430
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:58,139
think if we drive it from the inside and

431
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,779
come up with stuff that that is sane and

432
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:03,899
reasonable and promotes good products

433
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:06,180
for the patients I think we'll have a

434
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,190
standard that they would adopt right and

435
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,100
I think that's ultimately what we should

436
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:15,420
be in for so I'd love to see sanity and

437
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:18,389
reason from our government period let's

438
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,640
move on ours is a global community with

439
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,470
unprecedented access to technology our

440
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,240
online communities and forums have

441
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,220
become more prevalent what relationship

442
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,210
do you feel our industry will have with

443
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,470
tech and online communities I find them

444
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,059
to be a good place to start

445
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,259
you know you hit the message boards when

446
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,669
you find a problem that you

447
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:36,839
you haven't encountered before or

448
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,029
something that you're looking at you'll

449
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,470
hit the message board see you know see

450
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:41,940
some of the smaller scale growers what

451
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,450
they've run into things that they've

452
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,059
tried stuff like this um but I think as

453
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:52,170
we mature as an industry we need to

454
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:54,990
start moving towards purity papers you

455
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:57,300
know real research with solid controls

456
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:00,990
and actual things done other than just

457
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:02,549
you know my 4/20 guy up there on it

458
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,950
saying this is absolutely tobacco mosaic

459
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,169
virus or something something similar to

460
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,850
that so I really think it's a good place

461
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,350
to start but as we move forward we

462
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:12,269
really need to start going into a more

463
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,889
scientific field more peer-reviewed more

464
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:16,139
real data

465
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,630
I think the boards are great especially

466
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,820
for first-time growers and people coming

467
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,290
into our industry think of the

468
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:25,679
information that they're looking for and

469
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:27,569
then obviously as you graduate there

470
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,610
should be March the board that go all

471
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:31,319
the way up into the scientific community

472
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,240
where we can talk to each other in the

473
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,069
language where we understand it doesn't

474
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,529
sound like a foreign language when we're

475
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:44,970
speaking with someone that's needed as

476
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:47,730
well I've got a lot of project ideas by

477
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:51,720
looking at those forums so it's always a

478
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:54,569
nice place to look but as you said so

479
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:59,579
like I think we should move toward more

480
00:18:54,569 --> 00:19:02,220
like peer-reviewed articles and like

481
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:03,839
more curated source especially like I

482
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,740
have a plant pathology background so I'm

483
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,419
interested like in cannabis diseases and

484
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,039
this is one of the worst example like

485
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,960
you will see a lot of pictures and then

486
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,609
people oh this is that thing and this is

487
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,130
that thing and often it's not that at

488
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:20,219
all like I seen many people saying this

489
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:23,010
is rust I'm sure nobody has ever seen

490
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,799
rust on cannabis so there's a lot of

491
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:27,809
misinformation so I think that's why we

492
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:32,490
need to move toward like more curated

493
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:34,250
platforms and stuff like that no I agree

494
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,930
hundred percent although I will say that

495
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,640
when I first started growing and I had

496
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:41,900
brown spots and I didn't know what they

497
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,900
were I I went to the board

498
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:49,869
gene-editing and genetic intellectual

499
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:51,579
property will become hot topics in

500
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:53,949
popular culture in our scientific

501
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:56,048
community and indeed here at can MIT

502
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,730
what does genetic modification in

503
00:19:56,048 --> 00:20:00,158
cannabis actually mean and how do you

504
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:03,400
feel about this technology oh I'm sorry

505
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:06,419
so go genetic modification so let's look

506
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,159
let's start with the definition right so

507
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,960
cuz a lot of things that we talk about

508
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,110
in the cannabis industry are not GMO

509
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,058
right so if when you have a knockout

510
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:18,278
that's used CRISPR or something like

511
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:21,240
that that's GMO right and but

512
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:24,369
technically it's not even GMO because

513
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,250
traditionally GMO was you introduced DNA

514
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:29,889
from a from another organism into that

515
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:33,190
recep recipient organism right that was

516
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:35,799
technically why European Union went nuts

517
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,808
and genetic modification was banned and

518
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:40,869
bla bla bla right so so when you use

519
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:42,519
CRISPR to knock a gene out is that

520
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:45,099
really genetic modification or is that

521
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,769
just accelerated breeding because we use

522
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:49,028
marker-assisted breeding to do the same

523
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:50,379
thing and that's not genetic

524
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:53,200
modification because we use traditional

525
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:59,289
breeding techniques we just accelerated

526
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:03,460
right so having said that have at it i I

527
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:06,669
mean I completely agree so there's a lot

528
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,500
of stuff that is not considered genetic

529
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:10,538
modification and that people can grow

530
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,750
organic and one example is that crops

531
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:15,970
have been like irradiated to produce

532
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,880
mutation like the red grapefruit is an

533
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,579
example so CRISPR to me is just the same

534
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,929
thing but instead of you know having

535
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:25,389
thousands of unknown mutation you have

536
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:27,640
one mutation exactly where you want so

537
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,909
if you want to consider gene editing as

538
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,559
a GMO then all those array-like

539
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:36,669
gamma-irradiated crop need to be

540
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:39,190
considered GMO as well what people

541
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:41,890
aren't aware of a lot of the vegetables

542
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,500
and fruits that you're eating today have

543
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,690
been gene edited in it and then you can

544
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,929
use both a conventional path or gene

545
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,960
editing I think the two go hand-in-hand

546
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:56,110
but the future in cannabis you're going

547
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,370
to see a lot of gene editing it's going

548
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:58,928
to

549
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:01,989
we're looking at it now we're doing it

550
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:05,350
now I I think that it's important it's

551
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:08,440
not considered GMO and you can get to

552
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:12,730
the results in some cases a lot quicker

553
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,230
so I personally like it I agree with all

554
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,440
the panelists here I think there's no

555
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,659
way around at least gene editing in our

556
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,000
field on I mean let's be honest we have

557
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:23,919
read nothing for resistance to pathogens

558
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,950
diseases anything that we've bred

559
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,190
strictly for smell flavor taste potency

560
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,710
excuse me we've really bred for nothing

561
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,980
but one see smell taste looks like that

562
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:38,558
nothing that that affects resistance to

563
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,000
anything and we're really behind we're

564
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,200
gonna need to really step up as an

565
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,190
industry to make sure that it's done

566
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,679
safely and it's done carefully and with

567
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,870
with some purpose as we move forward but

568
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,620
there's just no way around using it to

569
00:22:49,869 --> 00:23:05,500
kind of get back in line with the big

570
00:22:53,619 --> 00:23:16,000
egg all right what does it say about

571
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:18,398
gene editing boy I lost my place I have

572
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,679
I have also something more to say so in

573
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:23,168
so in California here you have someone

574
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,440
you have a couple actually so pamela

575
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:30,639
ronald inner husband role role and Adam

576
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,980
Chuck so one is a like a big advocate of

577
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:35,709
gene editing technique the other one is

578
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,569
an organic grower and to me that's the

579
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,940
perfect example of what the future

580
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:42,668
should be like organic growers should

581
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,000
embrace gene editing technology because

582
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:48,730
it's just the future

583
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,440
gene Eric will also allow for more

584
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,440
competitively priced products in the

585
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:57,370
marketplace if you got a bio synthesize

586
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,110
a cannabinoid it's going to be a hell of

587
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:02,349
a lot cheaper to gene added a plant and

588
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:05,138
grow it in the field and so gene editing

589
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:07,808
is going to offer certain hard-to-get

590
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:09,849
cannabinoids at more affordable prices

591
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:12,700
that means our products

592
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:19,149
we'll be more affordable for the patient

593
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:20,980
to buy as well ironically as the science

594
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,919
is the molecular biologist here I'm not

595
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,860
a big fan of gene editing and so go

596
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,740
figure but I but at the same time you

597
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:32,109
know traditional breeding accelerated

598
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,089
with molecular diagnostics is another

599
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:35,649
form of gene editing that just doesn't

600
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:39,220
use the CRISPR technology right it's

601
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:41,470
it's intelligent breeding done with data

602
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,210
that you say you're driving to a product

603
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,880
right that also can be done in an

604
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,429
accelerated fashion and to be honest

605
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,710
gene editing to model is a great thing

606
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:55,298
right so so if I'm trying to build a

607
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:57,880
strain gene editing helps me determine

608
00:24:55,298 --> 00:25:01,658
whether or not that feasibility study

609
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,909
works but then you go back or I go back

610
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:08,200
and then breed it traditionally using

611
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:10,659
molecular markers so do you think the

612
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,210
farm bill and legalize tent is going to

613
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:16,480
change how we approach cannabis IP hell

614
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,870
yeah here it goes you know why because

615
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,110
if you look they make you put it says

616
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:25,029
hemp derived phyto cannabinoids I love

617
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:27,428
that that means we can grow any kind of

618
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:30,369
cannabinoid unman to produce any kind of

619
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:33,220
cannabinoid except THC that plan is wide

620
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:35,798
open for research there's a lot we can

621
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,890
do with them do you think we're gonna

622
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:40,779
see more research into isolating we're

623
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:46,210
gonna see a lot of research in in

624
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:47,319
regards to have the future isolate

625
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,579
different can I have analyzed for

626
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:53,730
textile use for production of CBD your

627
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:59,379
ear to see all kinds of different things

628
00:25:53,730 --> 00:26:01,029
coming out of them absolutely I'd

629
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,100
actually say that you're gonna see hemp

630
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:05,168
that's being bred from multiple passes

631
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:06,939
right so right now we talk about hemp

632
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:13,210
for CBD or we talk about hemp for fire

633
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:15,490
excuse me passes at at you know multiple

634
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,500
bites of the Apple right so you know we

635
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,849
we talk about CBD hemp or fiber hemp or

636
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,609
you know have

637
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:25,730
but for protein right 4c right but

638
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:27,369
theoretically if you if you are gene

639
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,130
editing or you are breeding

640
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:33,979
intelligently you actually can build a

641
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,840
hemp that you you extract the CBD first

642
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,819
and then you send it on for fiber

643
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,339
processing etc there's no reason why

644
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:45,649
that can't be done it's just we haven't

645
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:46,970
had a reason to build it yet so yeah

646
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,580
that's that's what has been done for

647
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:53,870
flax for example where you used to have

648
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:56,149
like flax for for linen and flax for

649
00:26:53,869 --> 00:27:00,439
seed and then they built that like full

650
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,940
usage or double purpose flax so will be

651
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,120
the same for hemp hemp will be used

652
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:20,298
completely so then it's reduced waste as

653
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:22,129
well communities I can really only speak

654
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:24,918
to the local community just with the

655
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:26,780
with the laws and regulations but you

656
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,659
know I think it's it's improved the

657
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:32,178
community quite a bit in Colorado we've

658
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:33,770
seen quite a bit of money pushed into

659
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:36,980
our schools quite a bit of money pushed

660
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:38,798
into our roads um quite a bit of money

661
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,890
just pushed into our economy in general

662
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:45,230
as well as just taking away what is a

663
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,179
lot of us have lived with is the fear of

664
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,919
what is a great product you know it is a

665
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:51,470
safe product what is something that is

666
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,049
wonderful to use um so I think the work

667
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,669
we're doing here is really starting to

668
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:58,220
improve and then change and change the

669
00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:02,780
minds of most of the world on what

670
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:05,990
cannabis can do for for everyone very

671
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:08,359
locally so like my my lab is located for

672
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,029
like eight minutes drive from licensed

673
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,859
producer so every time they have a

674
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:15,168
problem they will just call me and then

675
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:17,658
it's very easy for me to try to help

676
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:20,330
them so that's the very local way to

677
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:23,210
help the the industry but from a more

678
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:27,048
global perspective I'm trying like with

679
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:29,890
my group to put some resources that will

680
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:32,000
help the order the industry from like

681
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,530
internationally like one example is that

682
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,440
I'm trying to build that

683
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:38,000
pest and disease survey for now of

684
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,400
course it's a little bit more restricted

685
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,680
to Canada because of shipping problems

686
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,690
but this is something that at some point

687
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,630
some people in the US will add their

688
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,509
information and by building that global

689
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,280
database it will just help anybody in

690
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:53,440
the industry no matter where they are in

691
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:56,629
the world

692
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,840
do you see a need for a global pest and

693
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:02,810
disease database for sure because I mean

694
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:05,059
like if you think of Dutch elm disease

695
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:07,129
chestnut blight those were all disease

696
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:09,200
that were not present on in the US and

697
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,120
we're introduced from elsewhere now we

698
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,980
have a chance to know those disease

699
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,019
before they arrive here so we need to

700
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,200
know what is present here what is

701
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:20,000
present elsewhere and put in place like

702
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,789
all the detection assay that medicinal

703
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,559
genomics will develop for us and so you

704
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:27,740
know you'll be able to know when

705
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,960
something is new and make sure that is

706
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,730
destroy him immediately as a cultivator

707
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,390
it's more vital than ever we did all of

708
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,950
that yeah lately I've been enjoying

709
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,690
going to different countries around the

710
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,360
world and there was a few more that want

711
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,610
to see me and talk to me about getting

712
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,469
their programs together and we have a

713
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:47,479
lot in this state we have a lot of

714
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,730
experience a lot of people have a lot of

715
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,920
experience you should share that with

716
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:55,910
the world because you'd be surprised how

717
00:29:51,920 --> 00:30:00,410
many countries and ministers in those

718
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:02,390
countries have no idea at all about what

719
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,430
to do they're excited they want to be

720
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:08,060
part of it but they they just don't

721
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:11,750
understand it so our community should be

722
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:18,889
going out to the world and teaching and

723
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:20,930
instructing so the science that we've

724
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,940
done is open publish so that's available

725
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:27,680
to everybody I hope I hope they take

726
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:30,860
advantage of it because you know a we

727
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,350
worked hard on it for you guys but you

728
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:35,959
know we shared it because there is a

729
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:38,389
need for the community to kind of pick

730
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,210
this up pick itself up out of the dark

731
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:44,540
ages by science and get ahead of the

732
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:46,410
curve right so one of my big things when

733
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:47,789
I came into the industry was hey

734
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,550
if you don't do it they'll come and do

735
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:55,549
it for you right so which is the truth

736
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:59,039
and so I that but on the more local side

737
00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:01,470
you know it's been a real pleasure to be

738
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:06,690
able to educate and again it's about

739
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:08,910
education people about genetics and the

740
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:11,100
power of marker assisted breeding and

741
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:14,120
how that stuff actually can bring the

742
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:19,919
cannabis industry a whole generation

743
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:21,239
faster right so you know I think the

744
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,310
most important thing that we do is is

745
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,920
the education part both on the local and

746
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:28,559
the global side right so and I would any

747
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:32,160
of you who have not had that opportunity

748
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:35,099
people are so thankful around the world

749
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,390
I was in Zimbabwe recently talking to

750
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:39,750
the Minister of Agriculture there and

751
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:42,750
they they love when people come and

752
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,450
teach them right so if any of you have a

753
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,130
heavy desire to teach this is the

754
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:51,330
industry to do it in because people are

755
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,980
hungry for we know so what advice would

756
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:54,899
you give the young person who is

757
00:31:52,980 --> 00:32:00,539
interested in cannabis today with that

758
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:02,310
in mind look if you're a young person

759
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:04,500
you want to get into this industry go to

760
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:08,279
go to a lot of shows talk to a lot of

761
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,349
people go into labs get tourists talk to

762
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:15,119
people who are in the trenches

763
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:17,309
understand this industry as much as you

764
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,519
can but more importantly than that pick

765
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:22,079
the area in which you want to go into

766
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,670
because there's so many different

767
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:28,289
aspects in this industry first find

768
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:30,960
where you want to go what you want to do

769
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:44,220
and then study the hell out of it both

770
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:46,809
academically and in the trenches I think

771
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,100
I mean it's like don't work alone and

772
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:51,839
[Laughter]

773
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:54,149
perhaps be open especially on the

774
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:57,419
cultivation side we like to call it the

775
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,740
e grow but no know that there are a

776
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,788
million different ways to grow cannabis

777
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,190
and none of them could be

778
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:06,108
wrong but you know to be open to new

779
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,109
experiences and new ways of doing things

780
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:12,509
so we've talked a little bit about the

781
00:33:09,358 --> 00:33:14,278
cultural social and economic impact that

782
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:16,349
we've had on our communities I want to

783
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:17,519
talk about social equity programs that

784
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:19,888
have become more and more commonplace

785
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,628
with new states they're being enacted in

786
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:23,099
several different states to help level

787
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:24,839
the playing field for those individuals

788
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:26,908
who've been disproportionately affected

789
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:29,038
or disadvantaged by cannabis prohibition

790
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:30,749
what are your thoughts on programs like

791
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,329
this that give licensing preference or

792
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:36,329
discounts to people with prior cannabis

793
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:39,108
convictions I think by and large the

794
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:41,638
program's being put forth are all shams

795
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:45,749
honestly I don't think any of them are

796
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:48,569
actually doing people of color much good

797
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:53,848
anywhere how about people with rare

798
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:55,528
cannabis convictions look I've been

799
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:57,778
approached several different ways I've

800
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:59,729
had people come to me hey I'm gonna get

801
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:01,979
this opportunity in this social equity

802
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:04,499
program do you want to buy your license

803
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:06,389
for from me and then the other one is

804
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:08,789
will you partner with me oh that's

805
00:34:06,388 --> 00:34:11,128
that's not a bad idea you shouldn't sell

806
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:14,039
your license you get that license find a

807
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:16,440
person get a great lawyer and make a

808
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:21,358
deal that you can you can live with or

809
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:23,548
as my answer was before start studying

810
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:27,598
your ass off and figuring out what this

811
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:30,628
industry is and learn by the path of

812
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,720
hard knocks and become a business person

813
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:36,328
and you'll do extremely well it is a

814
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:39,178
hell of an opportunity for you to get

815
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:41,369
one of those licenses do not squander it

816
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:45,298
take that opportunity and run with it

817
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:46,470
and go as far as you can and if you want

818
00:34:45,298 --> 00:34:48,449
to know more about it you can listen to

819
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:50,818
business outlaws I teach business there

820
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:59,279
all the time I talk about cannabis stuff

821
00:34:50,818 --> 00:35:02,608
too alright with that in mind I'm going

822
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,440
to ask my final question which I've

823
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:06,509
asked her in every AMA I ever hosted

824
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,670
where do you envision the cannabis

825
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,670
industry in five years from today

826
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,840
well I guess I mean we discuss about

827
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:22,940
like having a unified set of you know

828
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:26,070
testing approaches we talked about

829
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,170
networks communities so I hope that we

830
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:31,340
will have some global partnership that

831
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,720
will emerge from from all those

832
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:37,730
conferences that that we that we have

833
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:40,019
and yeah I mean public databases and

834
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:43,219
what I would really like to see would be

835
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:45,659
like an international germ plasm

836
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:55,649
repository but I guess I'm dreaming

837
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:57,599
about this one so no I so an

838
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,579
international germ plasm repository

839
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,380
would be outstanding right so we have

840
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:05,000
them for every other important economic

841
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:07,289
crop hemp arguably is one of the most

842
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,880
important economic crops and it's never

843
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,039
been put in there to any appreciable

844
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,410
degree I believe there are some hemp

845
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,050
strains in the volcanic Institute in

846
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:18,389
Israel but I'm not sure that would be a

847
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,490
good representative sample of all the

848
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:22,619
hemp in the world so it's something that

849
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:25,349
we need genetic diversity is a thing

850
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:27,480
it's being lost we know that from

851
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:30,659
science because we've seen papers where

852
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,900
they've seen the hide that drive for

853
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:35,909
high THC has completely eliminated some

854
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,460
minor cannabinoids and hide TAC strains

855
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:39,960
right so so we are already doing damage

856
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,500
to the plant and losing some of those

857
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,420
minor cannabinoids on that side and but

858
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,730
the reality is is in three to five years

859
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,019
now at least from the regulatory side

860
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,190
we're not going to be in any different

861
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:51,539
spot than we are we're gonna have the

862
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,190
same conversation three to five years

863
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:59,219
from now about the USDA coming in and

864
00:36:53,190 --> 00:37:02,250
regulating things for us so well five

865
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:07,949
years from now I see we have banks that

866
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:10,349
accept cannabis companies I see the USSR

867
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:14,129
opened up I see a lot more hemp being

868
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:16,920
growing around the world and I see a lot

869
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:19,980
of countries look at South Korea now has

870
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,159
in in their creams and their stuff that

871
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,579
they put on are allowing for CBD

872
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:27,039
Oklahoma opened up I thought

873
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:30,130
be the last date actually that are Utah

874
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:33,340
and and they're available so you just

875
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,990
you just never know I see that the world

876
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,480
is gonna open up it's going to be a

877
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:39,459
totally different marketplace I believe

878
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,380
the United States will be able to import

879
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:48,610
and export there won't be a problem with

880
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:50,890
280e and will be able to bank I see us

881
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,809
growing a lot of a lot more especially

882
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:56,049
cannabinoids as we discover what these

883
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:59,019
do and what we're looking for I also see

884
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:01,539
the industry possibly following what the

885
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:03,880
the the beer industry has done where it

886
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:05,440
goes through a band flows of micro

887
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,570
breweries and then just major huge

888
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,630
breweries um with the cost of regulation

889
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,800
with the inability to take the tax

890
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,380
breaks and stuff that are available

891
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,390
right now I really see only the big guys

892
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,789
surviving for the next five years and a

893
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:21,369
lot of the mom and pops dropping out but

894
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:22,869
as we move forward even past five years

895
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:25,119
and we start kind of correcting some of

896
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:26,589
the regulation issues that we have I you

897
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,019
know I'll see some some of the more

898
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:38,019
micro grows come back into the into the

899
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:39,759
field right after alcohol prohibition it

900
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:41,380
took 30 years for everything to get

901
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,720
straight now and we have the internet

902
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,400
and better communication so I'm gonna

903
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,139
guess that I'm going to say 15 to 20

904
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,809
years this thing should be pretty well

905
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:52,500
running the way it should be whatever

906
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:56,110
way that's gonna be hopefully so yeah

907
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:58,599
well guys and everybody here before I

908
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:00,160
open up a QA session I'm sure everybody

909
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,929
has some questions I want to take a

910
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,609
moment to recognize all of you here

911
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:06,250
every one of you here is a trailblazer

912
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,260
who has impacted our community in some

913
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:11,110
way shape or form and we all owe you a

914

you've had on all of us thank you

917
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:23,559
[Applause]

918
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:26,349
and also we're hiring scientists if

919
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:29,619
you're interested send into science at

920
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:31,659
advanced hemp dot-com science at

921
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:35,039
advanced hemp comm we're looking for the

922
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:35,039
brightest smartest people out there

923
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:42,669
alright yeah gotta get it so as we

924
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,980
depart today I have a message for all of

925
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,809
you I heard every individual who's

926
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,179
assembled here today to take a moment to

927
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:51,219
reflect on your own community and the

928
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,960
impact that you're gonna have on it how

929
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:55,569
does your work your research and your

930
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,760
dedication change your community what

931
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:01,090
would be your legacy with that in mind

932
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:12,600
let's all work together question is the

933
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:17,500
following thanks guys you talked about

934
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:20,500
four needs for deeper collaboration so

935
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,269
what I would love to hear an example you

936
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,460
can share where you had collaborated

937
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:26,739
with the stakeholders and where you

938
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:31,990
would want that how would you want that

939
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:33,419
to be improved going forward I'm sorry I

940
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:38,169
missed the beginning of that question

941
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:41,980
the question is having spoken about the

942
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:45,760
need of more collaboration I'd like to

943
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:49,119
hear an example of what would that mean

944
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,100
like if you had collaborated already but

945
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,349
you know you would like to have a better

946
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:57,579
collaboration what would that mean give

947
00:40:53,349 --> 00:41:01,150
an example thank you

948
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:03,369
so my example would be he where he just

949
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:06,490
sat down Kevin's back there so Kevin and

950
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:08,799
my team thanks to the outstanding

951
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:12,329
sequencing work that Kevin did on

952
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,100
Jamaican Lion my team was able to find a

953
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:18,610
57 terpene genes we just published that

954
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:21,400
paper last weekend plus one again so you

955
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:23,620
know steep hill has its own genetic

956
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,300
program medicinal Charles had his own

957
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:27,009
genetic program but yet we were able to

958
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,550
come together and do some great work

959
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,550
together so

960
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:34,429
everybody's read that paper by the way

961
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,929
and and don't be afraid to ask go up to

962
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:38,210
somebody introduce yourself

963
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:40,519
and shake their hand and go hey I like

964
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,338
to talk to you about X or Y or whatever

965
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:45,380
just don't just just go up to be amazed

966
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:49,150
how many people especially here I talked

967
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:51,670
to are just willing to open up and talk

968
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:55,039
hi there thank you guys

969
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:57,858
wonderful presentation I'm curious what

970
00:41:55,039 --> 00:42:00,259
what exciting trends do you guys see and

971
00:41:57,858 --> 00:42:02,960
how are those trends sort of guiding

972
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:06,230
your whether it's your work in terms of

973
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,909
strain development just what trends do

974
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,889
you see in the market that you think are

975
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:12,259
going to become you know whether it's

976
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:14,000
the next CVD to use you know that is an

977
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,109
example of something that's come in

978
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,699
recent years which is legs in a bowl I

979
00:42:17,108 --> 00:42:21,769
think that's exactly it at least for the

980
00:42:19,699 --> 00:42:23,328
trend for me that I'm most excited about

981
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:25,909
is finding what the different

982
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:27,559
cannabinoids do what the different

983
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:31,250
terpenes do and what the entourage

984
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,859
effect does between these you know you

985
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,358
can you know take the synthetic

986
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:37,279
synthetic THC and it doesn't do anything

987
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,539
the same as the THC grown from a plant

988
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,829
and I really do think that's from the

989
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:41,449
entourage effect the different

990
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:43,579
cannabinoids and different turkeys even

991
00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:45,108
the different files that are in there so

992
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:46,970
just a bunch more research into these

993
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:48,469
isolating these products and really

994
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:49,578
seeing what makes me tick and then what

995
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:53,629
makes them tick together

996
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:54,980
I think that's there's a lot of research

997
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,150
that needs to be done on the interaction

998
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,179
between the terpenes and the

999
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,010
cannabinoids and you guys are doing some

1000
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:07,789
of that research presently thank you for

1001
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:09,049
that thank you okay in regards to the

1002
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:10,940
all the information that we have to

1003
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:11,949
collaborate on passing throughout the

1004
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,880
world

1005
00:43:11,949 --> 00:43:15,848
technology is a great way to build

1006
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,019
platforms to get that information

1007
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:19,519
expedited from point A to point B and

1008
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:21,949
keep track of it

1009
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,710
what kind of platforms and technology do

1010
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:27,439
you guys suggest be built in order for

1011
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:30,099
this industry to accelerate at the speed

1012
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,099
we want it to

1013
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:42,220
from a programming system standpoint we

1014
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:44,469
need platforms that are very strong that

1015
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:46,779
patients can go to you know tilray has a

1016
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:49,419
very strong platform we need grower

1017
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,160
platforms for people who can who want to

1018
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,619
grow at home I mean there's a lot of

1019
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:56,289
these countries are allowing six plants

1020
00:43:53,619 --> 00:44:00,609
per household so we need these very

1021
00:43:56,289 --> 00:44:03,849
strong platforms without a bunch of I

1022
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:06,490
call it hippie magic you know it's it's

1023
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:08,619
just real science real stuff this is how

1024
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:10,779
stuff's done this isn't behind this guy

1025
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:13,179
this isn't theory this is this is what

1026
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,670
if you do this you'll get this if you do

1027
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:17,139
it you know follow the instructions and

1028
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,269
do you guys think that there's

1029
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:22,599
opportunity for AI and machine learning

1030
00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:24,759
and additional technologies used in in

1031
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:28,449
the tech industry to make some of these

1032
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,520
decisions predict analysis I think AI

1033
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:32,289
will be a future you know people popping

1034
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:34,599
up explaining the things that you need

1035
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:36,699
to do and looking at that with spectral

1036
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:38,500
now assistive actually could be in your

1037
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:41,679
garden and a person could pop up and go

1038
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,210
hey you've got spider mites or hey

1039
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,949
you've got powdery mildew and here's

1040
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:46,389
what you need to do at this this is

1041
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:48,129
early stage because we've caught it

1042
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:49,869
absolutely the two could come together

1043
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:52,200
and you'll see stuff like that the

1044
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:54,730
future for sure

1045
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:59,129
technology to identify problems in your

1046
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:59,130
plant pest control deficiencies

1047
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:06,789
integrated into platforms or the

1048
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:12,489
diagnostic for the purposes of diagnosis

1049
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:14,559
of different issues there are already

1050
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:17,139
like different number of companies that

1051
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,849
are developing that for many crops so I

1052
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:22,420
mean cannabis is just a different crops

1053
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:25,329
so like SS like a biotic and abiotic

1054
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,700
stress like the water status of your

1055
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:29,860
plant and even like for cannabis that

1056
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:31,869
you could probably find a way to assess

1057
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,700
when the trichomes are already you at

1058
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:40,029
the perfect stage for harvesting better

1059
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:42,969
than the human high human I can do thank

1060
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:45,430
you thank you could could the panel

1061
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:45,919
speak to the over these next five years

1062
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:48,919
the

1063
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:52,400
of genetics and intellectual property in

1064
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,349
the determination of the value centers

1065
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,710
in this industry the winners and the

1066
00:45:54,349 --> 00:46:00,440
losers how important a role will

1067
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,829
intellectual property patenting all of

1068
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,829
that play

1069
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:09,829
reg Mike look patents are always

1070
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:12,559
valuable the money guys like to see

1071
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:15,230
patents you're gonna see a lot of

1072
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,269
strains going forward being patented and

1073
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,769
different techniques and things because

1074
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:27,079
people want to protect their investments

1075
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:30,590
that's just how business system yeah

1076
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:32,929
yeah intellectual property is is a part

1077
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:36,170
of the fabric of business right so you

1078
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:38,569
you really cannot run a successful

1079
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:41,840
business these days without intellectual

1080
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:44,150
property the cannabis industry is full

1081
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:49,100
of potential intellectual property right

1082
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:51,920
so from plants trains to I'm a patent

1083
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:53,960
agent so the the number of applications

1084
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,070
that I see coming out in the cannabis

1085
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:02,300
industry is is enormous from things like

1086
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:04,760
hot gas extraction right what a thought

1087
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,710
right so but the there is so much

1088
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,170
innovation in this industry right now it

1089
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:11,659
would be I would be surprised if we did

1090
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:14,269
not see the cannabis industry taking a

1091
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:21,859
large segment of issue patents in the

1092
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:25,309
next ten years thank you on I love the

1093
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:28,390
word co-op petition said cooperation and

1094
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:31,429
competition combined and my question is

1095
00:47:28,389 --> 00:47:34,359
both the commented questions initial it

1096
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:37,579
to you Reggie and this is creating

1097
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:41,539
community through economic cooperation

1098
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:43,039
and as a breeder got really big into hip

1099
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:46,009
breeding where in southern Aragon I'm

1100
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:48,380
with a company that's really dedicated

1101
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:52,520
to breeding hemp and I create what I

1102
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:55,099
laughingly call three ways four ways I

1103
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:56,920
have a breeder as good feminized pollen

1104
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:59,269
have a homie over here there's got a

1105
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,630
greenhouse full of ladies let's put that

1106
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:02,179
too

1107
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:04,490
let's share that strain three ways and

1108
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:07,099
my question that's what I call it the

1109
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:09,799
three way specifically is if you could

1110
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:14,059
speak to that kind of whatever you want

1111
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:17,330
to categorize it as the intellectual

1112
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:19,159
property the cross-licensing how to do

1113
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:21,769
that I love to do that because I've just

1114
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:25,039
taken four breeders and we've created

1115
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:28,000
cooperation economically so we have to

1116
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:30,650
play together otherwise what we see in

1117
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,980
certainly in Oregon is the potential for

1118
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:36,139
all those readers to get swallowed up by

1119
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,570
a big company but if we're working

1120
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:41,480
together to start with that to me is a

1121
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:44,900
way to create co-op petitions I welcome

1122
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:47,949
any other thoughts on that no that's

1123
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:50,030
actually a brilliant way to do it and

1124
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:51,079
probably a real smart way to do it so

1125
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,450
now you've got it

1126
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,670
so so but here's where the science comes

1127
00:48:53,449 --> 00:49:00,500
in to support that right so you your

1128
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:02,480
scenario you had a guy with a green

1129
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,300
house flow ladies and somebody with

1130
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,240
really good male pollen right so from

1131
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:11,870
that cross you will obviously find

1132
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:14,179
several fee knows unless it was a true a

1133
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:15,529
true breeding male and a populate some

1134
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:16,940
true breeding females in which case

1135
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,410
you're gonna get one offspring right but

1136
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,920
either way you're gonna come out with

1137
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:26,029
some phenotypes from that cross that are

1138
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:28,340
desirable science the science part of

1139
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:30,470
this is you fingerprint them you get you

1140
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,320
identify that unique genetic signature

1141
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:35,029
and then you can then use that unique

1142
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,340
genetic signature as the basis of a

1143
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:39,860
licensing program and then because it's

1144
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,440
like a unique genetic signature we're

1145
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:45,530
talking about FBI level unique right

1146
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,000
because every cross will produce a bunch

1147
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:51,590
of offspring that have their own

1148
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,619
genetics right so now anybody not in the

1149
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:56,570
four of you growing that obviously got

1150
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:59,299
it through something gotten gains and

1151
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:02,240
there's a you know either somebody let

1152
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:04,640
it go or somebody stole it but now you

1153
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,919
have the ability to protect this right

1154
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:09,049
so you follow a plant patent on it it's

1155
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,099
not very expensive it's the plant as

1156
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,568
shown and described

1157
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:14,400
you print it you got the genetics and

1158
00:50:12,568 --> 00:50:18,119
now you have the basis for a very

1159
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,639
credible legal foundation to build this

1160
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:31,499
business on it's a brilliant idea more

1161
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:33,778
people should be doing it hi I'm dr.

1162
00:50:31,498 --> 00:50:35,278
Xion Walker and I really want to

1163
00:50:33,778 --> 00:50:38,009
appreciate you guys for coming out and

1164
00:50:35,278 --> 00:50:43,739
sharing everything and I think it's

1165
00:50:38,009 --> 00:50:45,809
pretty awesome so I decided one day that

1166
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:47,608
I couldn't go back into my office and

1167
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:49,609
continue to do what I was doing because

1168
00:50:47,608 --> 00:50:51,960
I needed to be more in the community

1169
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:54,268
educating and this came after a patient

1170
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,249
came into my office and told me hey you

1171
00:50:54,268 --> 00:51:00,238
know I feel so much better and I got

1172
00:50:56,248 --> 00:51:03,419
this vape so I carry this I've been

1173
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,670
having this thing for over a year and I

1174
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:09,539
will show it to anybody who wants to see

1175
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:11,970
it I looked at it from across the room

1176
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:14,039
and a person said oh it's really cool or

1177
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:16,909
not I said oh my god they've really got

1178
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:20,849
an event they've gotten a camouflage

1179
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:24,649
cartridge the thing has so many toxins

1180
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:29,400
in it until it looks like camouflage

1181
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:31,798
it's brown and spotted all over so while

1182
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,389
we sit here and we talk about all the

1183
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:35,960
education that we need and the things

1184
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:39,748
that we need to share among ourselves as

1185
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:44,099
community of professionals we still have

1186
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:46,919
a professional or moral or obligation to

1187
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:49,259
talk to everybody we see about

1188
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,239
everything that we know because they

1189
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:54,748
don't know and somebody's gonna kill

1190
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:56,759
themselves or you know die and it'll be

1191
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:59,399
attributed to cannabis canvas will have

1192
00:51:56,759 --> 00:52:01,650
nothing to do with it and all of the

1193
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,239
work that's being done here will go back

1194
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:06,930
under the rug again it'll get

1195
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:10,318
criminalized again and we'll still yeah

1196
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:13,949
forgot we haven't gotten already yep so

1197
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:16,199
I just wanted to remind us it's that we

1198
00:52:13,949 --> 00:52:17,818
still have an obligation to the

1199
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,939
community to make sure that we educate

1200
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:22,349
so I've decided to you know Chuck all of

1201
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,940
that sitting around listen to people's

1202
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:24,900
problems all day but and get out in the

1203
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,778
community

1204
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:32,960
educate people so that they will know so

1205
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:32,960
that's kind of my lane dr. Walker

1206
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:40,019
[Applause]

1207
00:52:36,768 --> 00:52:42,149
I guess I'm the last one here so I have

1208
00:52:40,018 --> 00:52:44,608
a question because I I'm finding the

1209
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:46,858
community aspect of this whole event

1210
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:50,998
very intriguing especially this talk so

1211
00:52:46,858 --> 00:52:54,328
thank you for contributing to it but how

1212
00:52:50,998 --> 00:52:55,739
do I say it I'm on the East Coast and I

1213
00:52:54,329 --> 00:52:58,499
think the innovation and collaboration

1214
00:52:55,739 --> 00:53:00,449
is is wonderful and it's gonna just

1215
00:52:58,498 --> 00:53:03,659
advance and accelerate us as you are

1216
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:06,538
saying but the way it translates to me

1217
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:09,179
not being as immersed in the industry as

1218
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:12,630
you all are is is the products that we

1219
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:14,730
get say out on the East Coast are by far

1220
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:17,608
I'm sorry if I offend anyone but a far

1221
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:19,559
it inferior to then what you get out

1222
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:23,429
here on the west coast and so well my

1223
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:25,769
question is is the collaboration effort

1224
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:27,210
in any community whether it's with

1225
00:53:25,768 --> 00:53:30,389
cannabis or other things there's always

1226
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:32,548
the ringleader you know in certain areas

1227
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:35,068
of expertise and then that translates

1228
00:53:32,548 --> 00:53:38,009
into innovation and community and then

1229
00:53:35,068 --> 00:53:39,808
the byproduct is these this you know the

1230
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:43,739
great product so what do you think is

1231
00:53:39,809 --> 00:53:46,499
the essential thing for you know in a

1232
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:48,358
place that has the products excuse me

1233
00:53:46,498 --> 00:53:50,518
California has products that you can get

1234
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:53,190
that you know help people that are

1235
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:55,768
really in need like the patients on the

1236
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:57,450
East Coast there's not as much because

1237
00:53:55,768 --> 00:54:00,118
they haven't caught up so what I'm

1238
00:53:57,449 --> 00:54:03,028
worried about is as a patient lying to

1239
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,980
get certain products I want that

1240
00:54:03,028 --> 00:54:08,039
collaboration to really accelerate as

1241
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,869
much as possible in specific areas and

1242
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:12,028
in California there there's a plethora

1243
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:14,249
of you that just are out here and

1244
00:54:12,028 --> 00:54:17,009
there's think tanks and all that and I'm

1245
00:54:14,248 --> 00:54:19,078
not saying there aren't places all over

1246
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:21,059
the place that have them but maybe not

1247
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:23,880
as concentrated so what do you feel is

1248
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:26,849
the best way for to encourage the

1249
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:29,910
collaboration of say what's going on in

1250
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:32,548
California with places that are further

1251
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:34,528
behind and therefore the patients end up

1252
00:54:32,548 --> 00:54:37,179
suffering if that makes sense it's

1253
00:54:34,528 --> 00:54:40,139
actually not a a collaboration thing it

1254
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:45,460
has more to do with regulations and and

1255
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:48,190
attitudes right so if we had no borders

1256
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:49,809
for cannabis to cross state lines you'd

1257
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:52,240
have the same products on the East Coast

1258
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:54,849
the issue is is that states like New

1259
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:58,239
York think that it's only CBD and it's

1260
00:54:54,849 --> 00:55:01,000
only oil right and and then you have to

1261
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,469
look at the way the licenses are given

1262
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,449
out because now you have the good ole

1263
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:06,039
boy network where you have the ten

1264
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:06,639
richest cronies who are friends with the

1265
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:08,829
governor

1266
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:10,868
again the licenses and they may not know

1267
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:12,490
what the hell they're doing right so it

1268
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:14,230
has more to do with that then it has to

1269
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:16,358
do with collaboration because the

1270
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,949
products are there the only thing

1271
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:26,318
keeping you from getting them is

1272
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:28,210
distribution in like say Boston or in

1273
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,130
Massachusetts they're recreationally

1274
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:32,440
legal but now it's like we're trying to

1275
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,910
catch up and they don't have a lot

1276
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,760
there's just a lot of stuff they don't

1277
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:38,399
have so you're still isolated and

1278
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,390
quarantined in Massachusetts from

1279
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,289
California from all of us here on the

1280
00:55:40,389 --> 00:55:46,029
west coast so I think until we do away

1281
00:55:44,289 --> 00:55:48,608
with the interstate commerce clause that

1282
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:50,680
prevents us from shipping cannabis

1283
00:55:48,608 --> 00:55:53,009
domestically you're gonna still run into

1284
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:55,808
that problem that's the real issue I

1285
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:59,260
think the other part that is actually so

1286
00:55:55,809 --> 00:56:00,730
as you get regulations opening up and in

1287
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,069
Massachusetts where they just did

1288
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:06,159
legalize it so now you're gonna see a

1289
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:08,798
lot of the California companies set up

1290
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,808
shop in Massachusetts it will take them

1291
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,849
a little while to get up and running but

1292
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:14,798
they will use the same SOPs they're

1293
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:16,240
using in their California shops okay I

1294
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,579
hope you hurry up and get here because

1295
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:21,179
get to the east coast yeah thank you

1296
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:21,180
thank you very much

1297
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:25,599
[Applause]
