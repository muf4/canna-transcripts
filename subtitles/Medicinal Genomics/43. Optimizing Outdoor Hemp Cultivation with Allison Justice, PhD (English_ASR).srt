cultivation with dr allison justice

56
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,039
i do want to apologize for the audio

57
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,520
quality on this episode

58
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,519
it seems we had an unreliable internet

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
connection and as a result some of the

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,360
audio got a little garbled i don't think

61
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,039
it'll be too distracting and the

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,360
information that allison provides is

63
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,679
great so stick with us

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,239

started growing home

00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,478
yeah so we are a vertically integrated

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,280
hemp company

124
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,079

line

129
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,839
uh what got me into it um honestly it

130
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:29,439
was a

131
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,359
i i suppose a jump from marijuana uh

132
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,160
after i graduated

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
with my phd i went out to california and

134
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,199
worked in the marijuana industry for

135
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,479
about three and a half years

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,199
and

137
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,959
being from south carolina where i am now

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
um

139
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,038
south carolina

140
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,160
came out with regulations to allow for

141
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,240
growing hemp and my family being farmers

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
they got involved and you know

143
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,400
eventually it just made sense to to take

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,680
some of the knowledge i learned out in

145
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:03,120
california back home and um take it away

146
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,280
with cbd and cbg and all the other

147
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,759
uh cannabinoids that were allowed to

148
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,799
grow under help production

149
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,800
excellent

150
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
and now a few years back a lot of people

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,560
got really excited about the hemp

152
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,079
industry with the passage of the 2018

153
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
farm bill

154
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,240
of course that legalized some

155
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,400
cultivation and many farmers and sounds

156
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,639
like your family is one of them switch

157
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,879
their farms over to hemp or some you

158
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,120
know added hemp as a supplement to their

159
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,560
traditional crops uh to get in on the

160
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,840
boom so

161
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,360
what is the state of the hemp industry

162
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,119
now and where do you see it in the next

163
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,520
few years

164
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,800
yeah so you know that that first year

165
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,879
was a really big boom and you know a lot

166
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,199
of people jumped in

167
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,598
um i think even the year after

168
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,120
even more people jumped in and

169
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,560
so you know on one hand it's it's great

170
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,918
uh you know with the amount of people

171
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,879
growing him you know people

172
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:02,159
understanding it not being scared of it

173
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,519
but at the same time that initial jump

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,080
was

175
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,959
not great for the industry in a whole

176
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,839
um you know it put a lot of

177
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,719
biomass in the market put a lot of

178
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,598
people

179
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,720
you know whether whether they had uh you

180
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,478
know

181
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
a positive mindset for being in the

182
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,439
industry or not um they were there and

183
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,758
so there were a lot of people

184
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,680
selling you know seed they ended up

185
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,560
being marijuana or

186
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,439
um you know performing these co-ops that

187
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,038
they promised all of these farmers that

188
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,800
you know were basically on their last

189
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,519
leg this being their last hope to save

190
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
the farm and this huge co-op was going

191
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,198
to put all these farms together and they

192
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,080
were all going to be rich together and

193
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,240
then you know did not shake out

194
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,198
um so you know a lot of horror stories

195
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,240
came from it a lot of people lost money

196
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,319
um

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
some people have stayed in it and done

198
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,080
well um

199
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,080
and so there you know there's there's a

200
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,959
lot of good and bad of it you know i

201
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,878
think

202
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,959
this first initial

203
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,280
kind of shakeout uh

204
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,799
has really caused us the beginning of

205
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,679
restructuring

206
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,639
um how hemp is and and and how it's

207
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,800
grown and kind of you know the business

208
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,840
model and the landscape that it should

209
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,639
be in the u.s and it's finally getting a

210
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,318
little more um

211
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,680
legit

212
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,919
you know a little more um as any other

213
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,478
agricultural

214
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,199
industry

215
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,918
um wooden should be but it's it's been

216
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,560
slow and a hard road to get there but

217
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,079
you know but besides that portion um you

218
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,278
know the past few years have been

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,600
extremely exciting i mean

220
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,480
what we've learned about this plant and

221
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,800
and what it can do has been incredible i

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,120
mean just just for example i work very

223
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,958
closely with clemson university and you

224
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,240
know up until two years ago you know

225
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,000
they didn't even want to hear the word

226
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,159
help and now

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,879
i'm on grad committees with students who

228
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,799
are able to use their host plant as or

229
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,799
hemp as a host plant

230
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,240
um and just the amount of research

231
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,719
they're putting out and just just in my

232
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,278
little section of horticulture you know

233
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,180
uh vegetative production flowering that

234
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,519
sort of thing not even touching them

235
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,399
[Music]

236
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
and

237
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,519
uh

238
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
the animal science you know everything

239
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,080
else that can go

240
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,879
into it

241
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,879
just my little world of plant science

242
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,399
has just explode

243
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,440
some of the effect from just our own

244
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,120
customers uh you know

245
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,080
those are the things that i suppose keep

246
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,919
us going um is that that medicinal piece

247
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,920
that yes we really are helping people

248
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,519
and uh you know the industry kind of

249
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,000
straightening out

250
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,639
yeah no and you mentioned sort of the

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
other uses for hemp whether it be fiber

252
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,679
or um

253
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,839
uh the other ones that you've mentioned

254
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,079
so where where do we stand right now is

255
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,920
the lion's share of the market going

256
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,839
towards cbd or cannabinoid production

257
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,000
or are you seeing more more farmers

258
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,320
growing for fiber

259
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,399
you know i think people want to they

260
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,440
desperately want

261
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,440
i think the infrastructure is on its way

262
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,720
and on its way fast

263
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,399
and i know there's a few spots that

264
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,399
you know are either on in their late

265
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,720
stage of r d you know ready to to make

266
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,919
whether it's manufacturing

267
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,519
or

268
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:35,519
are growing um commercial um and then

269
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,639
there are a couple in existence but i

270
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,360
think

271
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,439
the demand of of wanting to grow that

272
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,440
type of crop versus

273
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,800
having everything lined up as far as

274
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,120
equipment

275
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,519
just to harvest an equipment to to

276
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,600
process it to fiber or

277
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,159
you know whatever the the industrial use

278
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,959
there might be is lacking a little bit

279
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:59,120
but you know i think by next year

280
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,559
there'll be a good many acres grown for

281
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,720
that here in the us

282
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,639
interesting yeah i

283
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
i'm a believer that you know hemp fiber

284
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,759
could be the future in a lot of

285
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,199
different ways it's just it's

286
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,200
i'm just surprised i haven't seen it

287
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
happen yet so i'm glad to hear that it's

288
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,120
that it's right around the corner

289
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,039
you touched on research as well and that

290
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,320
a lot of the universities are now

291
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,240
willing to to do the research into hemp

292
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,720
production i was wondering have there

293
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
been some breakthroughs recently that

294
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,800
that you could kind of

295
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,799
tell us about and how can that research

296
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,799
into hemp also apply to cannabis

297
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,959
so again i'm going to go back to clemson

298
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,959
just because that's you know that's the

299
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,439
group i work the closest with i know

300
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,399
there's all sorts of great work going on

301
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,200
medicinally and and with fiber and and

302
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,240
animal feed and etc but

303
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,079
um

304
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,639
just with what i'm you know really

305
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,879
closely privy to

306
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,278
clemson university and a good many

307
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,958
others are doing some some really neat

308
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,799
work into

309
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:09,199
um you know the the physiology and um

310
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:11,599
direct application of science to help uh

311
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,560
flowering and so what i mean by that is

312
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,680
um

313
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,359
taking a hemp plant uh cbd dominant

314
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,638
and putting that in an indoor condition

315
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,759
so exactly what you would do with

316
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,879
marijuana you know 100 percent minus

317
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,159
you know just being a different

318
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,320
cannabinoid and so you know they're

319
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,519
they're able to you know have these

320
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,040
wonderful

321
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,759
um

322
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:36,480
grow chambers and get really nitty

323
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,919
gritty with everything from temperature

324
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,959
to

325
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,240
light intensity light spectrum

326
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,679
um

327
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,480
clemson right now is really digging

328
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,479
deeply in which is one of my favorite

329
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,920
things to study is uh the drying and

330
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,519
curing and so looking at um you know

331
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,120
what is what is ethylene's role because

332
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
you know in

333
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,639
in other

334
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,440
horticultural fields um you know whether

335
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,839
it's storage of apples or storage of cut

336
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,320
flowers you know we understand that

337
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,839
backwards and forwards we realize you

338
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,560
know what what sort of co2 o2 is going

339
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,399
out you know do we want ethylene there

340
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,479
to ripen up a banana or do we want to

341
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,399
pull ethylene out

342
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,720
because it's making our cut flowers

343
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,799
degrade and and die very quickly and not

344
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,440
be able to make it on the ship from you

345
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,679
know africa to to wherever

346
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,000
uh you know all of those really

347
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,559
important things as far as plant science

348
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,600
goes that we just have no idea how they

349
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,799
apply to to the cannabis plant

350
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,278
and so um you know nothing published

351
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:46,078
right now but that's just some of the

352
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,639
things that they're looking into and

353
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:51,759
um you know being directly

354
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,278
uh relevant to the marijuana industry um

355
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,120
you know that's just some some short

356
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,519
examples but you know the work they're

357
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,399
doing is is very critical

358
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,759
um to the point where

359
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,440
actually dr faust and i and so that's

360
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,759
that's who i

361
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,000
i work with very close to clemson that's

362
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,198
actually who i got my um

363
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,519
my phd under uh he's a flowering

364
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:19,278
physiologist so he has spent his

365
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,159
lifetime working

366
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,360
with the flowering of poinsettia bridge

367
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,559
looking at

368
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,800
um

369
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,958
unrooted cuttings and and those being

370
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,879
shipped across the us and you know how

371
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,838
to keep those alive longer

372
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:36,240
um how to preserve them and so

373
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,480
you know being being extremely relevant

374
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,839
to marijuana or

375
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,480
cbd production indoor so basically any

376
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,930
sort of smokeable flower production

377
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,079
um

378
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:48,399
[Music]

379
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,000
you know he's he's really grabbed hold

380
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,440
of and so

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,519
um

382
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,519
other industries so let's say the the

383
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,560
floor culture industry

384
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,879
they have organizations where you know

385
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,359
there's researchers that are really into

386
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,639
research which is immediately applicable

387
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,440
to to growing so you know be able to

388
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,759
increase efficiency or reduce labor

389
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,959
costs you know whatever it may be that's

390
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,838
applicable

391
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,838
um

392
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,360
they form these associations so for

393
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,839
floor culture it's the floor culture

394
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,680
research alliance um you know growers

395
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,360
will pitch in a little bit of money to

396
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,919
help support that research where they

397
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,480
can just you know go deeper and harder

398
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,958
um with it versus only being able to get

399
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,839
grants and then those growers are able

400
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,679
to take advantage of of you know being

401
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,920
first to the line up to receive that

402
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,519
information all through the year versus

403
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,799
you know wait two years for a paper to

404
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
get published

405
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,639
um

406
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,639
and so dr faust clemson university and

407
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,039
and the hip mind we have formed a

408
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,799
non-profit called the cannabis research

409
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,639
coalition um where we are

410
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,039
doing this exactly so forming an

411
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,120
association where growers you know

412
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,159
vendors people can join who really want

413
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,720
to push

414
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,399
research forward with the research um

415
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,800
you know knowingly really circulating

416
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,799
around uh smokeable flower production

417
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,639
and post harvest and you know the the

418
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,758
factors of hemp that our skill set is

419
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,639
really in

420
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,399
um

421
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,720
and so that's something exciting we just

422
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,879
launched you know a month ago

423
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,519
um and have had

424
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,720
a lot of interest um and interestingly

425
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,799
enough a lot of interest from the

426
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,680
marijuana industry because you know like

427
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,838
i said it's it's all exactly the same

428
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,958
and extremely relevant so

429
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,639
um yeah it's really exciting and i can't

430
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,479
wait to see what

431
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,278
what we'll be able to put out

432
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,278
absolutely i'm excited too and um

433
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,759
i think if there's room for a genomics

434
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,198
company uh to be part of that coalition

435
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,278
i i think i might be able to get you in

436
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,319
touch with one that that would be

437
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,639
absolutely we love that that's awesome

438
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
uh i will definitely follow up on that

439
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,079
um another thing you touched on that i

440
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,079
want to come back to is drying and

441
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,919
curing um

442
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,519
and that sounds

443
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,679
really interesting in a number of ways

444
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,679
but one from at least our perspective

445
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,399
medicinal genomics we we do a lot of

446
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,240
microbial testing and

447
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,519
how important is the drying and curing

448
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,240
process and

449
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,879
maintaining your you know mainta making

450
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,959
sure that your your finished product is

451
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,280
clean and free of any microbes because i

452
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,439
know i've talked to other testing labs

453
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,078
who have actually helped

454
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,558
their customers you know pass

455
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,918
yeast and mold testing

456
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,399
largely in part by looking at their

457
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,880
drawing and curing process

458
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,480
oh yeah i think

459
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,160
it may be the most important part um

460
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,759
you know granted you're not

461
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
spraying

462
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,279
some sort of beneficial microbe the day

463
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,559
of harvest you know granted you're not

464
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,879
doing that

465
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,759
um you know i think it could be the the

466
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,400
number one factor and and being able to

467
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,558
pass those sorts of tests um

468
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,120
you know again reaching out to under

469
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,399
other industries and and understanding

470
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,439
how they

471
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,080
uh function and use science to make

472
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,640
healthy product um you know

473
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:12,399
understanding your water activity

474
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,000
and and how that influences

475
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
um so you know

476
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,599
basically water activity being the

477
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,719
amount of water that's there available

478
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:24,399
for microbes to to grow and prosper

479
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,120
um you know understanding how to

480
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,798
knock that water activity down fast

481
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,798
enough

482
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,440
to not allow for

483
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:35,759
continual microbial growth

484
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,840
but at the same time teeter-tottering

485
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,839
that line where you're not drying it so

486
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,159
fast to where you're losing all your

487
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,079
terpenes yeah and so there's there's

488
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,038
definitely a fine line

489
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,399
um

490
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,960
but in general yes if you if you bake it

491
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,400
you know dry it very quickly immediately

492
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,319
obviously you're going to have the least

493
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,280
risk of microbials

494
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,079
um

495
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,000
but you know we can't do that if if

496
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,240
we're growing for smokeable flour we

497
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,279
need to we want it to look and smell

498
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,759
good and so that that requires uh you

499
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,480
know a different scenario which we can

500
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,960
achieve and we can achieve but like you

501
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,480
said being able to to really dig into

502
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,240
somebody's drawing and curing and even

503
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,000
you know i kind of like to include it

504
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,798
when i do work with

505
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,558
growers in their post harvest

506
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,798
we don't just look at the day it enters

507
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,519
the dry room it's it's more of looking

508
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,639
at

509
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:33,279
um specifically the last few weeks in

510
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,759
the grow cycle you know what are you

511
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,200
applying what are you not applying

512
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,640
um

513
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,120
you know

514
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,120
how are you watering are you watering

515
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,959
with you know sprinklers from not

516
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,359
sprinklers but the uh the types of

517
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,360
emitters that kind of bubble up from the

518
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,119
bottom you know are you still applying

519
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,519
beneficial microbes through that and

520
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,879
it's actually aerosolizing to some

521
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,558
extent you know all of those factors

522
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,559
you know i like to look at and then of

523
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,158
course in the dry room you know how's

524
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,918
your air circulating where's your

525
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,880
where's your dead spots

526
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,360
um

527
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,120
you know where's your hot spots uh you

528
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,519
know all of those little factors are

529
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,279
just are so invaluable when

530
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,599
not only just producing a good quality

531
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,240
smokable flower but yeah being able to

532
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,480
pass those microbial tests

533
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,319
yeah and i gotta have to imagine that

534
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,200
being in a climate like south carolina

535
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,839
that's very humid that's even even more

536
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,640
of a consideration and i guess sort of

537
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,959
to that point i i did watch an interview

538
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,440
that you had done um with another

539
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,000
podcast when you were talking about

540
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,320
sort of the regionality of hemp

541
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,919
production and how you know you being in

542
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,720
south carolina and working a lot with

543
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,480
cultivators sort of in the southeast

544
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
and talking about some of the special

545
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,558
considerations that need to be taken

546
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,919
for what region that you're growing hemp

547
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,639
in so i was wondering if you could speak

548
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,799
a bit more to that

549
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,919
yeah yeah um

550
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:03,038
you know every i'd say every month

551
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,640
the importance of of having a variety if

552
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:05,839
you're growing outside

553
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
that

554
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,918
is conducive to that

555
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,158
environment for one reason or the other

556
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,840
is just is so important

557
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,559
and so i'd say that the two biggest

558
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,879
factors um you know with the the most

559
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,558
importance is one the the natural

560
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,360
disease resistance

561
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:26,240
so you know in the southeast you've got

562
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:29,759
really high humidity really high heat

563
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,038
and just uh you know a bountiful

564
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,839
natural

565
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,839
microbial existence of of pathogens

566
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,720
and you know with with considering you

567
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:45,038
cannot apply fungicides that

568
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,880
that are curative

569
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,558
let's put it that way

570
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,520
um

571
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:54,558
uh so being you know

572
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,879
synthetic pesticides uh fungus to the

573
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,599
ground having that natural population of

574
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,640
pathogen there just ready to fight your

575
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,918
plant

576
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,480
um

577
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,720
having some natural disease resistance

578
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,159
in the variety that you're using

579
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,038
um

580
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,720
it's just night and day i mean we grow

581
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,558
hundreds of different cultivars in our

582
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,519
field every year

583
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,759
and i mean it looks like we've done some

584
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,679
sort of chemical experimentation because

585
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,519
you'll see some roads that look like you

586
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,880
know the burning bush

587
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,319
you know it looks like it's been

588
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,480
completely burned where it's it's a it's

589
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,279
a fungal pathogen that

590
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,798
um there's some varieties that

591
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,440
no matter what you do i don't care if

592
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,240
you put the most expensive uh you know

593
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,159
beneficial fungus

594
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,480
fungal product out there on it every

595
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,919
single day it's not gonna it's not gonna

596
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,159
touch it

597
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,960
and so breeding and selecting for

598
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,880
those varieties which can

599
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,798
naturally ward off

600
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,080
um some of those problems is

601
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,480
is

602
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,359
beyond important

603
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,599
um

604
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,119
i would say the the second most

605
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,169
important factor

606
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,678
uh especially considering you know being

607
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,600
[Music]

608
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,519
being a vendor of the whole united

609
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,719
states yes we we focus in in the south

610
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,240
um

611
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:24,000
but you know understanding photo period

612
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,599
and so you know again working under a

613
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,519
professor that you know his research

614
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,439
revolved around poinsettias you know i

615
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,759
got a really nice intro to that in grad

616
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,919
school with another house plant

617
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,079
um but understanding that photo period

618
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,440
and you know being able to take

619
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,918
advantage of what you're doing by

620
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,480
understanding that per variety

621
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,480
it's just extremely special and

622
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,360
important and i think more important

623
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,960
than

624
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,959
many like to consider yet

625
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,360
um and so just to kind of give you an

626
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,600
example of that we have one variety

627
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,879
called southern sunset

628
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:02,798
and in the south it does fantastic

629
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,360
it it fly it initiates flower the latest

630
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:08,558
meaning it has the uh shorter flower

631
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,879
initiation time so for example

632
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:14,319
most varieties are somewhere around you

633
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,360
know once once the bell curve of

634
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,439
of time so if you think about

635
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,359
oh goodness you know the apex of the

636
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,558
summer where the days are the absolute

637
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,959
longest

638
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,678
um when it starts going back down so

639
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,679
we're going back into short days

640
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,679
once it hits a certain point that's when

641
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,120
a variety will flower so most will

642
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,960
flower when you hit about 14 hours

643
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,239
sunset on the other hand

644
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,400
it initiates at about 13 hours

645
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,599
30 minutes so it's only about a 30

646
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,000
minute

647
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,519
time difference but in reality it's

648
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,159
about a

649
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,119
two and a half to three week difference

650
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,080
and so what that means is this plant

651
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,399
initiates

652
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:01,839
two to three weeks later but then it

653
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,240
also finishes two to three weeks later

654
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,278
and so again in the south that is

655
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,359
wonderful

656
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:10,480
um it's starting to get cooler for that

657
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,240
late harvest um you can plant other ones

658
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,000
in your field that

659
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,640
um you know we'll have that 14 hour

660
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,919
photo initiation time and so then you've

661
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,440
got two weeks between your harvests so

662
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,278
you know you can harvest half of your

663
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,880
crop

664
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:30,640
put it in the the barn dry it uh clean

665
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,480
the barn out and then do the other half

666
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,880
farm so staggering

667
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,360
um so it really helps save that that

668
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,440
time and labor there

669
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,519
and so that's great it's a great plant

670
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,000
for the south but because we've done

671
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,319
trials in other areas

672
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,798
we understand well if you go if you go

673
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,558
above basically west virginia and you

674
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,639
grow this plant you're going to be in

675
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,200
trouble

676
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,440
very likely because it's going gonna

677
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,600
also finish late it's gonna grow well

678
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,519
it's gonna look you know look just as

679
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,240
good as it does in the south but the

680
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,879
problem is the frost sneaks up on you

681
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,599
because of that late harvest it's not

682
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,480
able to get to its its greatest maturity

683
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,038
before

684
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,440
it's killed by the frost

685
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,919
so um you know that just being another

686
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,000
example of why it's so important to

687
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,640
if you're if your goal

688
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,759
is to produce plants which grow outdoors

689
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,759
in a wide range of environments and

690
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,319
photo periods

691
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,240
you know while we do it

692
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,158
yeah so so you're really taking

693
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,120
advantage of the fact that you have a

694
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,320
warmer autumn down there in the south by

695
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,158
having this

696
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,000
this plant that initiates flower much

697
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,080
later in the season that makes

698
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,119
that makes a lot of sense um especially

699
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,558
as a

700
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:53,199
hobbyist grower up here in the northeast

701
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,678
definitely gotten burned before having

702
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,759
things finished late and not even so

703
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,120
much the frost but we always seem to get

704
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,519
battered with just

705
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,839
cold wet raw

706
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,759
um type of days that just i mean

707
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,319
botrytis just loves that sort of stuff

708
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,839
so exactly

709
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,200
so speaking of disease resistance

710
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,038
because you did bring that up and you

711
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
said that you select for disease

712
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,839
resistance now are you

713
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,840
intentionally inoculating these plants

714
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:21,278
to see if they develop symptoms are you

715
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,278
just sort of putting them in the field

716
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,519
and and kind of letting nature do its

717
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:25,519
thing

718
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,678
so in the southeast uh you don't need to

719
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,679
inoculate

720
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,278
i mean if if we're talking botrytis um

721
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:40,558
southern blight

722
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:42,798
you know some of some of those are

723
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,200
really common ones you don't need to

724
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,798
inoculate you know it it's there it's

725
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,038
there and it's gonna take down those

726
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,038
plants uh which

727
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:54,000
you know are either naturally

728
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:57,759
unresistant or if if let's say you don't

729
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,839
water them for four weeks or you know if

730
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:03,839
if by your own fault you make the plant

731
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:06,639
week it shows up as well um but yeah we

732
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,639
don't really need to

733
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,559
yeah and and going back to the photo

734
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,960
period thing too because i did i did

735
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,038
read about it on your website and i was

736
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,360
kind of fascinated to hear it because of

737
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,599
course the general

738
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,158
rule of thumb with growing cannabis is

739
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,599
you know vegetative it's 18 hours of

740
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,320
light and then when you want to flip it

741
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,158
to flower it's 12 hours but it was

742
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,558
interested to hear that you know that

743
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,640
that 12-hour rule is not

744
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,480
set in stone that it can be

745
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,720
can be variable right

746
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,960
oh yeah yeah that i'm

747
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,880
that's perfect if you're inside and you

748
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,120
know all you got to do is flip a switch

749
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,240
or or set a timer but

750
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,639
nature has its its own photo period and

751
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,679
it's you know we we never get to that

752
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,720
18-hour time slot

753
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,600
and so

754
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,440
yeah

755
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,359
we're

756
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,038
our varieties are nowhere near what we

757
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,558
do indoors

758
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,079
but we do it indoors because it works um

759
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,000
that's not to say

760
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,199
you know where we're

761
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,720
that's not to say that that 12 and 24 or

762
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,120
12 and 18 wherever it may be um you know

763
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,720
that's not optimized you know some of

764
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,199
the work again that they're doing at

765
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,278
clemson is showing you know again how

766
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,278
you can even endorse

767
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:24,558
how you can manipulate

768
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,240
some of

769
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:31,678
those metrics uh based off of a

770
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,679
variety's response you know you can you

771
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,519
can have your plants

772
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,798
take off a week

773
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:42,000
um to begin that flower initiation or

774
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:44,720
you can on certain varieties you know

775
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,119
be able to apply 14 hours of light and

776
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,759
that's during flower and that's four

777
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,558
that's two more hours that you could you

778
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:55,359
know fill that plant full of photons

779
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,158
and so um you know it's it's not just an

780
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,719
importance understanding it outdoors but

781
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,960
the the indoor cycle too really being

782
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,240
able to maximize yields is

783
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,000
um

784
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,720
you know i think we're going to get some

785
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,720
some really funky rules and recipes to

786
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,600
follow in the next couple of years

787
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,038
versus just the the 12 18.

788
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:16,959
yeah wow that's that's really

789
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,319
interesting and when you said that it

790
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,120
reminded me of something else that i saw

791
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,839
on your website was

792
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,558
using supplemental light as a way to

793
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,119
sort of trick the plant into not

794
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,798
flowering um do i have that right i'm

795
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,918
sorry i'll let you yeah yeah

796
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,398
that's

797
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,679
that's right so kind of opposite of

798
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:40,239
sunset you know that's initiating flower

799
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,000
um at 13 hours

800
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,798
we have varieties that

801
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,240
you know i've termed as semi-autos

802
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,319
because i don't really know what else to

803
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,640
call them especially in this industry

804
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:53,038
and how we use certain terms

805
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,038
um because it's not a true autoflower

806
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,558
because autoflowers

807
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,519
you know it's it's basically just a

808
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:01,839
ticking clock it's uh once it gets to 63

809
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,519
days you know whether the lights

810
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:08,319
um right one hour or 24 hours it's gonna

811
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,880
flower based on age uh meaning you

812
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:13,439
cannot take clones from it you can only

813
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,320
reproduce it through c

814
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,200
um

815
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:19,119
whereas these flowers um you know they

816
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,159
truly are photoperiodic it's just they

817
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,759
have a really long initiation

818
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,000
um so

819
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:29,119
in order for them to stay vegetative

820
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,599
they have to have 18 hours

821
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:35,038
and so if you think about it anywhere in

822
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:37,599
the u.s at any point of time you're only

823
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,119
ever going to top out at what 15 15 and

824
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,038
a half hours

825
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,839
and so

826
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:43,519
um

827
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,158
you know if you if you are in a

828
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,880
greenhouse growing this plant as stock

829
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,960
you keep it under 18 hours you're you're

830
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,880
able to grow stock plants you take

831
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,640
cuttings from it keep those cuttings

832
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,480
above 18 hours

833
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,278
it's just like any other plant but then

834
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,000
you take that plant the the liner and

835
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,240
you plant it outside and it flowers you

836
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,359
know it gets to maybe a foot tall and

837
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,480
it's done

838
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,158
and so

839
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,599
you know

840
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,120
you you think all right well maybe this

841
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,599
is terrible this is a terrible thing

842
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,918
let's trash this variety but if

843
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,678
if we if we work this right we can

844
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,759
really take advantage of of this

845
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,880
knowledge around this plant

846
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,919
and uh

847
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,600
and and do some really cool things so

848
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,120
what some of my growers and and

849
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,719
ourselves at the hip mine um have done

850
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,359
i think our top

851
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,399
semi-auto uh selling variety is peach

852
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,000
haze

853
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:37,359
smells great

854
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,319
um

855
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,798
you know what we're able to do is

856
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,918
in south carolina you know

857
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,558
basically

858
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,399
may 15th we can plant our first plant

859
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,798
and and when i say that i mean it

860
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,000
because that's when the last frost has

861
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,558
came

862
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,798
um you know we can plant

863
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:00,319
pjs out there turn on a flood light

864
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,000
from two sides

865
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,000
and

866
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,480
as long as that flood lights on it'll

867
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,278
continue to grow vegetatively

868
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,880
and so you know two three weeks however

869
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,720
you know close or far away you want to

870
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,039
space them

871
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,798
you cut that light off

872
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,879
and then you're flowering

873
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,440
and so you know that's that's really

874
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,000
special and important because in south

875
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,519
carolina um

876
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,599
we can do that three times in a season

877
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,399
um you know without the expense or

878
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,639
annoyance of pulling shade cloth

879
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,079
building a greenhouse you know having a

880
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,360
hoop house where you've got guys out

881
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:42,480
there pulling cloth every single day

882
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:45,278
and able to really maximize that growing

883
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,519
season outside

884
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,038
the other thing it's it's really useful

885
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,679
for

886
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,599
is you know greenhouse growers

887
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,919
if if you're an existing greenhouse

888
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,599
grower if you're wanting to put in a

889
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,600
blackout system

890
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,079
it's just as expensive as basically you

891
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,798
know building in a greenhouse it's just

892
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,639
about impossible and so

893
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,358
instead you pick a different variety you

894
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,440
pick peach hays um you know you grow it

895
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,598
just like you would any other plant

896
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,918
except you put maybe string lights you

897
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,480
know just very inexpensive led string

898
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,559
lights across the row

899
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,440
you keep it again you keep it vegetative

900
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,960
for

901
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,200
a couple weeks

902
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,760
turn the lights off and you're flowering

903
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,319
and you never have to pull shade cloth

904
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,399
um and you can do that all year long

905
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,679
because again you're never getting under

906
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,039
18 hours

907
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,960
right so you're flowering right in the

908
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,519
middle of summer

909
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,838
wow that's great you know and and you

910
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,398
touched on too that's it's great for for

911
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:47,279
you as um as a clone producer as a

912
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,799
nursery um because you're able to unlike

913
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,399
with autoflower like you said you can

914
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,000
still take cuttings

915
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,719
you can still clone so i think that's a

916
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
nice segue to talk about um maybe seed

917
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:00,159
production versus clonal propagation

918
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,199
so i was wondering i mean maybe we can

919
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,399
start

920
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,078
with you

921
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,358
kind of explaining from from a business

922
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,920
perspective why did you decide that you

923
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,319
know clonal propagation or selling

924
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,838
clones is is more

925
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,519
um

926
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,639
advantageous than than being a seed

927
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,000
producer

928
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,078
yeah

929
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,838
well i guess a lot of things go into

930
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,960
this answer

931
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,358
um

932
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,920
you know first off you know if we go

933
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:31,679
back to

934
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:34,240
2016 when when hemp was well

935
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,879
i'm sorry when i was i guess 2016 i was

936
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,759
playing with him in california under the

937
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,599
marijuana rules so you know when i'm

938
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,680
when i'm playing with him

939
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,440
um

940
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,319
you know

941
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,079
you can look at it a few ways one

942
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,720
if you're a marijuana grower you know

943
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,560
how how are you propagating

944
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,719
it's usually from clone

945
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,440
and what's the reason for that well

946
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,679
because we want high consistency

947
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,320
um we want ease

948
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,159
we don't want to have to pheno hunt

949
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,680
um

950
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,679
there's a there's a million reasons that

951
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,960
i could go on and on

952
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:16,639
um you know again at the beginning of of

953
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,240
when him really got going the the price

954
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,319
whether you were growing just for

955
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,399
isolate or you know the

956
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,039
uh let's say the product you would get

957
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,960
the least return on whatever it was the

958
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,440
price was still that

959
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,199
um clones were

960
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,559
were achievable you were gonna meet your

961
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,559
roi

962
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,320
um

963
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,639
the other thing i would like to add to

964
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,720
that and is very important and i feel

965
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:44,000
like from from your point of view

966
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:46,799
it makes a lot of sense you know

967
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,838
how long have we been breeding

968
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,960
him

969
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,078
um

970
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,720
you know

971
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,599
being from the horticulture industry you

972
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,159
know

973
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,838
it for just a platoon a new petunia to

974
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,199
be released you know it could take eight

975
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,440
years

976
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:04,639
you know to breed it to be confident in

977
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,800
it to send it around to uh different

978
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,400
regions to do trials and understand the

979
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,359
data and then be able to guide your

980
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,599
customer on how to grow it to the to the

981
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,199
greatest extent and then

982
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,240
them do well and want to order from you

983
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,559
again

984
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,199
um and you know going back to that first

985
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,199
year there's sea producers where in the

986
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,358
world they came from i don't know

987
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,239
um you know popping up saying that

988
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,519
they're home based in north carolina

989
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,118
and uh

990
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:33,519
you know

991
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,720
giving out genetics that are crushing

992
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,960
people

993
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,439
you know are not doing what they say or

994
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,000
you know have four percent thc in it et

995
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,480
cetera et cetera um and uh you know

996
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,960
we've had time since then and and there

997
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,280
are some um you know legitimate seed

998
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,559
companies out there now um that have had

999
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,000
time and

1000
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,799
um

1001
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,960
time to to not only help homogenize

1002
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,440
their seed lines but time to

1003
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,599
to help themselves understand where

1004
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,559
those varieties can grow best

1005
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,119
um

1006
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:07,358
so in in in short it takes time to grow

1007
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,400
a really nice homogeneous line of any

1008
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:09,199
plant

1009
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,119
um

1010
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,799
and so you know between those two

1011
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,960
reasons

1012
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,359
it made a lot of sense to

1013
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,760
breed select and and find those clones

1014
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,519
those uh those vegetative plant

1015
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,280
materials that you know i could be

1016
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,079
extremely confident

1017
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,040
in

1018
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,039
you know be be able to

1019
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,519
you know lead my customers down a path

1020
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,920
of success whether that's you know this

1021
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,599
is when you're no matter where you're at

1022
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,000
you give me your zip code and i can tell

1023
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,240
you when this plant is going to initiate

1024
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,079
and when you should get it tested and

1025
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,559
when you're not you know at what point

1026
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,000
you're going to go hot what diseases you

1027
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,239
know will

1028
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,400
will you struggle with you know

1029
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,279
every single detail for success that you

1030
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,079
know

1031
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,760
i was able to do that by understanding

1032
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,720
the plants i was working with which

1033
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,040
would only happen at this point in time

1034
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,000
through clonal lines

1035
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:05,759
um

1036
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,280
you know that's not to say that i don't

1037
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,720
believe that

1038
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:14,720
for for oil production um that seed is

1039
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:17,118
is not the future if it's not the now um

1040
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,919
you know if if you are

1041
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,720
are

1042
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,000
struggling to get 200 per kilogram of

1043
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,879
isolate

1044
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,960
it probably makes sense to grow seed and

1045
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,800
if there's a little bit of variability

1046
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,079
between you know

1047
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,480
six and twelve percent or

1048
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,720
if they don't look exactly the same or

1049
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,280
if they have let's say a stagger of of

1050
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,480
two weeks finish time you know maybe it

1051
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,079
doesn't matter because you're just going

1052
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,280
to chop them all down with a tractor

1053
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,160
anyways

1054
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,200
um

1055
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,799
and so

1056
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,879
you know the the market that we're

1057
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,440
really approaching and

1058
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,559
you know customers that that we work

1059
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,720
with or are the ones which

1060
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,119
are growing for smokeable flower

1061
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,039
um many of them now

1062
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,960
this past year and and especially coming

1063
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,119
up this current year uh you know they're

1064
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,318
growing for terpene production

1065
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,280
and so

1066
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:10,000
you know

1067
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,560
the the variability

1068
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,838
in seed with terpene production is also

1069
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,759
there

1070
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,599
and so if you're growing for terpene

1071
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,920
production you want every single plant

1072
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,039
to to basically have that same terpene

1073
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,240
profile

1074
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,159
and so

1075
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,598
you know again with the the return on

1076
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,920
terpenes being

1077
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,480
much higher than let's say isolate you

1078
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,119
know they can afford a little bit higher

1079
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,800
plant cost and it makes a lot of sense

1080
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,000
because their quality at the end there

1081
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,318
is going to line up be all the same um

1082
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,480
and and be able to to get a good price

1083
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,440
point for it

1084
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,760
excellent

1085
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,800
yeah glad to hear that you know terpene

1086
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,040
the terpene market is flourishing it is

1087
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,318
it's always good to hear um so winding

1088
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,159
down here i did want to give you an

1089
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,960
opportunity to talk or i did want to ask

1090
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,279
you about uh the field day event that

1091
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,240
your your team puts on um because i

1092
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,240
think it's a great educational event

1093
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,318
um where people get to

1094
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,639
get to actually experience the plants

1095
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,000
that you're producing and and really see

1096
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,118
how things

1097
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,559
uh um

1098
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,760
are performing in the field before they

1099
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,318
purchase it so i was wondering if you

1100
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,560
talk a bit about that and um

1101
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:22,159
why you believe it's it's so important

1102
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:24,400
yeah so it's my i guess you say most

1103
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,719
stressful but favorite time of the year

1104
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,559
um i know i know the feeling we put on

1105
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:31,039
the conference every year yeah pretty

1106
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,119
much the same way exactly you look

1107
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,920
forward to it and you're like

1108
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,358
but uh no it's it's something that i i

1109
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,838
really love doing and i i

1110
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,920
you know from the get go i saw value in

1111
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,440
but year after year you know really

1112
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,440
seeing um

1113
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,039
seeing how it's shaped out and the value

1114
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,000
that is brought to other people has has

1115
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,079
been

1116
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,719
very endearing um

1117
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,480
but what we do is we host it's usually a

1118
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,118
two day field day

1119
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,280
and so i was saying earlier um you know

1120
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,599
we always send out our new varieties old

1121
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,960
varieties to very different regions of

1122
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,599
the us

1123
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,079
and and collect our data that way

1124
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,039
um south carolina being our our home

1125
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,079
base

1126
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:17,039
um you know we we do our own variety

1127
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:21,039
trial and so um you know brand new

1128
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,039
varieties existing varieties

1129
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,318
pheno hunts um you know we we have just

1130
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,000
about you know

1131
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:32,079
as many plants there in a 30 acre plot

1132
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,920
than maybe some states have it's it's

1133
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,560
really cool the testing costs are

1134
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,559
outrageous

1135
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,519
but it's totally worth it and it is such

1136
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,199
a treat getting to to see them um

1137
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,519
change over time and

1138
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:50,239
you know version three of cat daddy

1139
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:53,358
let's say uh come down the line but

1140
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:56,159
anyways we we plant those out

1141
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,519
um we invite the public

1142
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,440
farmers

1143
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,880
everyone out to see it

1144
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,920
and really the goal there is to

1145
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,920
you know allow a farmer who is unsure

1146
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,519
you know whether they want to plant

1147
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,119
cedar clone whether they want to work

1148
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,759
with us or another company you know

1149
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:18,000
whether they even want to get into him

1150
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,079
we try to provide guidance uh education

1151
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,639
and show them you know if you're looking

1152
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,039
for smokable flour you know this is what

1153
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,519
the expectation is you know here are

1154
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:30,079
varieties which that which fit that

1155
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,280
demand if you're looking for

1156
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,960
um

1157
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,319
i don't know a purple flower you know

1158
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,119
here's our segment of purple flowers um

1159
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,599
and really allow a farmer to

1160
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,160
see and touch and fill with his own eyes

1161
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,280
before putting in a purchase

1162
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,159
you know

1163
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,240
it's it's getting better and better but

1164
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,318
you know the days of of just being

1165
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,039
thrown one coa

1166
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:57,279
um and a picture and saying this is how

1167
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,440
it's gonna go you know send me twenty

1168
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,680
thousand dollars you know that's that's

1169
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,760
just not good enough you know people

1170
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,000
being able to come out and look at it is

1171
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,119
uh is highly important and then on top

1172
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,559
of that we have um you know i get up

1173
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,640
there and talk about all of our new

1174
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,920
introductions um

1175
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:15,679

1176
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,480
talk about some of the contract research

1177
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:20,000
we do um so you know within within our

1178

variety plots

1179
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,400
um we'll do research so this year one

1180
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,639
big one was with pro-mix they're a

1181
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,760
mycorrhizae company

1182
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,879
and so

1183
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,040
um you know having treatments with them

1184
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,358
with different varieties and you know

1185
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,880
being able to show the farmer that and

1186
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:38,000
show them the difference and what to

1187
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,400
look for

1188
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,239
um and then pro-mix being their own site

1189
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,680
where if they do have any questions you

1190
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:44,719
know they can talk to their technical

1191
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,879
rep and

1192
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,959
um so it's a little bit of a you know a

1193
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,720
mini trade show i guess you could say

1194
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,800
with you know about eight different

1195
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,919
vendors ones that i i use and would

1196
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,280
trust

1197
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,159
um to come and and and you know discuss

1198
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,640
everything from soil to

1199
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:02,639
zero tall

1200
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,200
but no it's a good time and then this

1201
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,679
year we had dr phil's come out and and

1202

there and on campus green houses so

1204
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:17,920

there's a lot of people getting into the

1210
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,039
hemp industry and it's hard to find good

1211
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,880
guidance and good information so the

1212
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,199
fact that you're you're providing that

1213
