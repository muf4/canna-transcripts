1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,400
welcome back to the can med coffee talk

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,199
lounge here at canmed 2022 i'm here with

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,199
any afia lab director of candisafe

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,519
chief science officer oh i am sorry

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,879
chief science officer india thank you

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,559
for correcting me

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,320
good to see you annie thank you thank

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,399
you for having me it's uh great to be

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,079
back at an in-person event now oh it's

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,159
fantastic i'm glad you were able to make

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,759
this happen yeah yeah and now in your

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,199
opinion what's the main value that you

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,480
get out of coming to conferences like

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,200
kmed

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,199
honestly the networking is invaluable um

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,719
just the ability to socialize and given

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,040
what's happened in the last couple years

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,039
just the ability to socialize with folks

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,799
that's invaluable but for me it's about

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,879
the tidbits of new information that you

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,759
always learn um you know the cannabis

22
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,000
plants so complex that anytime you get

23
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,198
to sit with some bright minds and and

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
see what they've been doing over the

25
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,558
last year or so in this case it's been a

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,799
few years

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,799
lots of great research i'm really

28
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,158
excited to really get to learn

29
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,478
especially what we've just been through

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
with medical practicum oh yeah you were

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,400
sitting in on that one yeah we're

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,439
sitting on that one and it is fantastic

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,920
i tell you

34
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,599
no matter how much you think you know

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
even if it's a regurgitation of the same

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,280
information from

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,439
previous years you always find things

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,519
you've missed previously

39
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,118
just being able to see the research

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,959
that's done not only on individual

41
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,118
cannabinoids but also

42
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,640
on whole plant medicine sure it's been

43
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,438
fantastic i mean we're learning more and

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,920
more about this plan um i think it was

45
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,438
uh dr sulak that spoke about there are a

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,719
whole new class of compounds that are

47
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,798
being found

48
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,640
that have to do with um

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,240
tryptophan or so in the cannabis leaves

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
i mean it's really interesting stuff

51
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,000
that you get to learn every time you i

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
come here so yeah no it's interesting

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,118
you say that too that even if you think

54
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,359
you're a

55
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,359
cannabis medicine or just a cannabis

56
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,959
expert there are those little tidbits

57
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,560
that maybe you didn't pick up on the

58
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,839
last time and that you can take away

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,200
yeah precisely i mean it's just like um

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,478
a little bit of relearning i mean in

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,399
anything you do you have to practice

62
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,318
right so even if you know we're just

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,520
hearing it again over and over it starts

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,439
to stick and you get to understand a

65
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,920
little bit more so i think it helps us

66
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,159
all in the industry just grow absolutely

67
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,598
um you mentioned the practicum any other

68
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,318
presentations at kmed that you're really

69
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,318
looking forward to um well i mean apart

70
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,280
from mine

71
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,039
um honestly i see a lot of great info

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,759
coming out of there i'm looking forward

73
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,840
to hearing what dr muchum has to offer

74
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,759
um now he'll have a video presentation

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,200
it sounds really interesting

76
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,799
with what he's got coming up so yeah i'm

77
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,799
really looking forward to that excellent

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,920
excellent um so your presentation that

79
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,360
you mentioned that we're all looking

80
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,039
forward to um is about preparing for dcc

81
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,239
standardization

82
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,919
and i know that one of the problems that

83
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,878
the dcc is looking to solve with the

84
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,399
standardization is lab shopping so

85
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,239
i was hoping you could maybe explain

86
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
what the problem of lab shopping really

87
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,599
is and how it kind of negatively affects

88
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,359
multiple factors of the industry um yeah

89
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,878
so essentially

90
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,680
lab shopping is when uh your clientele a

91
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,840
certain clientele go from lab to lab

92
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,920
either looking for specific results or

93
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,439
at least going to be able to compare the

94
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,679
results that are being given by the

95
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,800
different labs and potentially find

96
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,400
favorable results and from a certain lab

97
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,159
and they would get testing with that lab

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,000
for their compliance coa so this is

99
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,878
generally done in r d

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,959
um and as we know california has uh 40

101
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,239
something or so labs so there's plenty

102
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,158
of options

103
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,080
to continually you know travel and check

104
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,199
labs out until you find your favorable

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,360
results

106
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,079
um you know unfortunately it's one of

107
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,400
those situations where it's it's

108
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239
not positive for anybody

109
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,319
i like to put it in a sense that

110
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,560
everybody loses in that case you know we

111
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,158
talked about how for one a consumer

112
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,719
loses let's say for instance you're

113
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,919
talking about a potency result if

114
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,840
somebody's shopping for certain

115
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,839
potential results on flower sample

116
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,238
a consumer ends up buying a sort of a

117
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,798
potentially inflated result right you're

118
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,280
paying more for something that's not uh

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,799
particularly what you thought it is so

120
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,199
right you lose you lose money right

121
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,040
there um even the

122
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,199
through a distributed distributor

123
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,918
getting sold that way if you're paying

124
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,159
higher because of a potentially falsely

125
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,918
high result they're losing they're

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
paying more you know all this sort of

127
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,079
leads to a slippery slope where

128
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,000
regulators lose control

129
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,639
think about even the labs that do this

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
thing so labs start to lose in a sense

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,280
that uh they are producing these false

132
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,600
results labs that don't produce this

133
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,918
end up you know maybe losing revenue

134
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,680
eventually closing down or you know

135
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,639
laying off employees in that case the

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,800
employees lose right keeps going

137
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
employees lose right they potentially

138
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
get on unemployment

139
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,800
state loses right we as taxpayers end up

140
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
paying for this so it's just a slippery

141
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,639
slope of

142
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,879
continual losses that um there is really

143
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,720
no winner in this game yeah no and you

144
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,439
mentioned that there's a large number of

145
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,960
testing labs in california and there is

146
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,600
i imagine some

147
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,680
pressure of labs to give favorable

148
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,160
results in order to like you said keep

149
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,240
keep their business open so yeah that's

150
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
a really unfortunate situation you know

151
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,038
it's really unfortunate and yeah there

152
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,119
is that high pressure and it's it's not

153
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:24,478
easy i mean i've faced that pressure

154
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,478
myself you just have to be able to

155
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,478
you know be able to meet your consumers

156
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,279
or i should say your clientele's need

157
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,639
without going into unscrupulous areas

158
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,319
sure right

159
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,478
somehow it's not easy to stay in

160
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,560
business but there are plenty of ways

161
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,560
lab can stay in business as they sort of

162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,319
pivot around kind of cannabis testing

163
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
there's much more you can do apart from

164
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,478
you know potentially giving um inflated

165
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
potency results sure yeah and i know

166
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,959
that one of those ways that labs can

167
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
kind of provide more value to their

168
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,359
clients is offering more r d testing or

169
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,759
offering testing services that aren't

170
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,280
necessarily on the compliance panel like

171
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,439
virus testing for example and i know

172
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,239
that you would it can safely be doing

173
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,759
that

174
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
precisely i mean we're always looking

175
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,520
for uh what offers more value again this

176
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
industry we're only getting to learn a

177
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,120
little bit more um

178
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,038
there's so much more to learn we're only

179
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,038
learning very tidbit of what it has to

180
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,959
offer so yeah we're offering um some

181
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,639
value-added services like

182
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,159
viral testing hlvd beat curly we're also

183
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,840
looking at stability testing you know

184
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
something that folks are not really kind

185
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,198
of um most folks are not paying

186
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,439
attention to but they should be because

187
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,199
that's coming up as you start to talk

188
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,600
about expiry dating how are you really

189
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,439
determining that is it per ich guideline

190
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,759
so we start to offer some of those um

191
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,160
value-added services that uh are

192
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,680
undervalued yeah that's excellent no

193
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,479
kind of going back to the issue of lab

194
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,319
shopping and potency in particular i got

195
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,599
to imagine part of the issue with that

196
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,639
too is just this idea that thc values

197
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,720
are the determiner of quality um and

198
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,160
maybe if that weren't the case then

199
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,240
there wouldn't be so much pressure in

200
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,919
getting those high potency numbers you

201
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,400
know that's really it i mean that's a

202
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,318
great point um we're you know you go to

203
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,159
your dispensary and the first thing you

204
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,598
see is usually you know you have several

205
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
shelves and they have the top shelf and

206
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,560
it's really the thc numbers that get

207
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,759
highlighted

208
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,519
it's really interesting because the labs

209
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,319
do all this work to produce a beautiful

210
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,839
coa with all these assays terpenes and

211
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,080
other things and yet the thc gets

212
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,399
highlighted and nobody

213
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,839
apart from the buyers and sellers ever

214
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,839
really gets to see that coa it's really

215
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,519
meant for the consumer um so there's a

216
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,279
lot more in there that i think we need

217
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,120
to pay attention to you know a lot of

218
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,839
i'm starting to do a lot of work on some

219
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,038
other compounds such as flavonoids we

220
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,918
know has some great medicinal effects

221
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,918
just to push the attention away from thc

222
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,680
you know i'm starting to see

223
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,839
interestingly even states starting to

224
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,160
put limits on

225
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,598
thc um there is state like mississippi

226
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,360
that's coming out with regulations that

227
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,719
um they're actually limiting their

228
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,520
flower to 30 percent so essentially if

229
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,360
those regulations thick when you test a

230
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,598
flower that's above 30 it's an automatic

231
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,400
fail wow and the interesting thing is

232
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,079
they're um adding in all the thc so the

233
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,318
variance the

234
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:10,240
thc delta a and all of the above so um

235
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,479
it's something that perhaps maybe it's

236
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,879
not such a bad idea yeah right well

237
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,478
especially when you consider that

238
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,439
flower testing

239
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,199
uh

240
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,759
especially when you consider that flower

241
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
is rarely ever higher than 30 that's

242
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,120
true you really got to consider what is

243
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,439
the

244
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,598
capacity you know how much did the kind

245
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,959
of flower really produce right uh we're

246
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,838
looking we're talking in terms of

247
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,158
percent mass right so 30 percent is

248
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,479
really pushing it and some some reason

249
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,479
you know there are folks that grow 30

250
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,158
flour i think it gets pushed a little

251
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,560
further because we're doing by dry

252
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,000
weight right the labs are

253
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,479
the regulations that you should test by

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,278
dry weight so when you say it's 30

255
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,519
and then you it's about 12 percent 10

256
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,919
moisture and you add that in right it

257
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,320
bumps it up to high 30s and now you're

258
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,079
pushing 40 so people can kind of see how

259
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,720
you know depending on how that moisture

260
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,800
content and how that dry weight is uh

261
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,639
is added back into the math yeah you

262
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,799
start to push those limits so the real

263
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,958
flower percentage really is around maybe

264
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,199
mid-20s but then you end up pushing 30

265
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,879
because of driveway interesting no and

266
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,879
that's funny too when you said that in

267
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,639
mississippi if you test higher than 30

268
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,080
percent you see you might fail right so

269
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,439
you may have some lab shopping going the

270
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,879
other way right

271
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
it's really interesting because that's

272
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,838
what's going to happen so now

273
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,959
i guess if you grow anything good

274
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,720
relatively good don't go to mississippi

275
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,919
um right so lab shopping is going to be

276
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,680
the opposite way

277
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,000
now when you consider that you'd have to

278
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,919
yeah add in all these other thc

279
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,399
components um

280
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,639
also it's not even just flour they're

281
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,360
the regulations state something about um

282
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,439
uh concentrates or limited to 60 so

283
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
forget how all this 90 vape pens and

284
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,399
isolates

285
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,320
and whatnot so it's going to be

286
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,919
interesting to see if any other state

287
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,519
kind of adopts those sort of regulations

288
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,519
or if those mississippi regulations

289
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,759
actually stick yeah that is one of the

290
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,000
interesting ways um it's one of the

291
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,600
interesting outcomes of having multiple

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
states enacting different regulations

293
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,120
right it's kind of like all these little

294
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,600
test kitchens so you can see how these

295
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,360
regulations work yeah very true very

296
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
true and you know it's sort of what

297
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
exacerbates the condition we're in with

298
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,639
the different states having different

299
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,278
regulations so you know these

300
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,879
multi-state organizations may have um

301
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,200
producers in certain states you know

302
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,639
they they look for certain type of

303
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
results in another state they look for

304
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,159
another type of result so there's got to

305
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,560
be some kind of congruency in this

306
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,000
result we have to start to be able to um

307
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,879
standardize some of these things right

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
it comes back to standardization yes sir

309
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,360
so in addition to your talk on

310
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,360
standardization you're also

311
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,039
participating on a panel discussion

312
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,839
that's all about nutrients and the role

313
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,399
that they play in yield on cannabinoid

314
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,320
output i'm curious from the testing lab

315
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,919
perspective do you see a lot of

316
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,240
correlation between

317
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,958
nutri uh certain nutrients that are used

318
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,278
and sort of the the values that you see

319
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,479
on your tests you know that's very hard

320
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,320
to pinpoint you know great question

321
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,639
uh we do get

322
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,839
client requests to sort of do a nutrient

323
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,559
analysis

324
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,200
um but what ends up happening is

325
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,799
it's hard to say for a fact that it was

326
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,720
because of certain nutrients that you

327
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,559
are having this certain profile

328
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,759
what we do try to do for some of the

329
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,799
nutrient analysis they're looking for

330
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,600
you know you're looking for things like

331
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,000
calcium magnesium potassium all of those

332
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,278
is we have to sort of determine the mass

333
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,039
balance so

334
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,559
what is your input

335
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,159
and then you're testing the runoff water

336
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,759
what is that and then you're testing the

337
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,719
plant how much is left in there and

338
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,559
you're trying to do sort of a mass

339
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,320
balance okay my plan is up taking this

340
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,879
much and it's wasting this much or this

341
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,040
much is going to the runoff and and see

342
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:47,360
at what stage is uptaking certain

343
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:49,599
nutrients or is it just being you know

344
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,560
washed off essentially

345
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,120
but it's been quite difficult to exactly

346
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,638
say because you use a certain nutrient

347
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,159
mixture that your terpenes were greater

348
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,919
certainly there's an effect

349
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,199
but i think more research has to be done

350
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,278
it's definitely an effect on using high

351
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,959
quality nutrients and the right uh

352
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,240
proportion of nutrients at the certain

353
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,239
growth stages that's something you have

354
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,759
to consider that it's not you know the

355
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,600
same throughout is not a pre-mixed new

356
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,480
that you carry throughout the process

357
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,320
um

358
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
but it's really interesting to note that

359
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,839
yes you know something i meant to say

360
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,159
was that

361
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,240
um when we talk about nutrients not just

362
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,439
you know the beneficial one so things

363
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,000
like metals

364
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,320
um if they happen to be in the nutrients

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the plants holds onto it sure what i

366
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
found is that it's really cultivar

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,679
dependent you know a lot of people do

368
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,759
flushes at the end but we found that

369
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,519
certain cultivars like for instance

370
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,480
cadmium we'll hold on to that a little

371
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,560
bit more so if the same nutrients that

372
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,519
unfortunately contain cadmium was fed to

373
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,119
your entire grill different cultivars

374
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,440
you'll find that there's varying levels

375
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,039
of cadmium some passing and some failing

376
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,399
the regulatory limit once you do your

377
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,480
final coa

378
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,799
um just because of how the plant

379
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,639
actually holds on to that you know we

380
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,359
know these plants as a bioaccumulator is

381
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,440
uh yep but they can be released but the

382
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,120
residual levels are different for

383
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,120
certain cultivars yeah that's

384
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,440
interesting no it's interesting it kind

385
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,039
of it echoes the idea of the entourage

386
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,480
effect right like you have multiple

387
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,319
nutrients that are kind of having a

388
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,560
synergistic effect to help your plant

389
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,879
most certainly most certainly i think it

390
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,759
plays throughout the whole uh cannabis

391
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,078
uh

392
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,838
industry yeah really yeah

393
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,359
and even here at cam ed it takes all of

394
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,240
us from all the different disciplines

395
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,879
from the

396
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,399
scientific directors here into the

397
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,078
medical professionals to all come

398
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,360
together to better understand this

399
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,278
that's the beauty of it that's the

400
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,199
beauty of it covering all facets you

401
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,639
know that the

402
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,559
clinicians are learning from the

403
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,480
analytical chemistry we're learning from

404
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,799
the clinicians and it's all being tied

405
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,278
together i mean i don't think any of the

406
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,799
work can be uh separated in that sense

407
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,240
you we can we sort of have to work

408
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,838
together because uh

409
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
um you know whether they like it or not

410
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,440
the results are always tied together so

411
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,039
um

412
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
you know some i like say this but

413
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,799
somebody always said all boats rise in

414
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,399
the tide and that's always clear in this

415
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,000
industry all right i think it's a great

416
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,240
place to stop so

417
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,879
thanks again annie chief scientific

418
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,278
officer of safe i got it right this time

419
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,120
thank you thanks again to our sponsors

420
