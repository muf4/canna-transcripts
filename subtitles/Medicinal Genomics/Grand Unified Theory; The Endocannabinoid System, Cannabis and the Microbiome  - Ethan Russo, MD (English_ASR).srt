1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,669
thank you it's an honor to be here

2
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:15,079
especially to follow

3
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:17,300
Rafi my mentor and surrogate uncle on

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,609
this slide you'll see my email I'd be

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,919
happy to hear from you afterwards part

6
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,660
of this talk is contained in an article

7
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:26,589
that was just published last week that

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:30,109
I'd be happy to send to each of you

9
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:32,599
so here I am on the high wire without a

10
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:35,780
net trying to do an hour presentation in

11
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:38,719
15 minutes so let's begin

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,880
I will there's some disparate threads

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,439
here I'll try to tie together and hope

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,219
that it becomes coherent at the end the

15
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,599
human gut harbors a hundred trillion

16
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:54,589
microorganisms and there are 10 to the

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,020
12 per milliliter of these their genome

18
00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:00,050
exceeds that of the host humans a

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,690
hundredfold there's a difference in

20
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:06,170
obese humans they have more of a type of

21
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:10,819
bacteria called Bacteroides lower

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:14,299
Bacteroides and higher firma cuties this

23
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:17,658
fellow dr. Mohler did very interesting

24
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:20,629
study they actually went and sampled in

25
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:23,270
the field fecal samples from wild chimps

26
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:25,908
bonobos which are pygmy chimps our

27
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:29,090
closest genetic relatives gorillas and

28
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,310
human populations the microbiomes of

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,500
american humans are more different from

30
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,140
those of Malawi humans than the gut

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,079
microbiomes of Malawi humans are from

32
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:42,590
bonobos and you see the p-value there

33
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:46,489
you never see values like this unless it

34
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:49,579
is a clear finding looking at three

35
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:52,519
different continents in humans they were

36
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:56,118
lower microbial diversity than in Apes

37
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:58,640
in with respect to the bacterial phyla

38
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:03,728
classes orders families in general

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:06,890
there's a constriction of the diversity

40
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:09,878
Americans average 30 fewer bacterial

41
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,979
genera the lowest level of diversity

42
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:16,759
these changes have been associated

43
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:18,919
historically epidemiologically with vast

44
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:21,318
increases in gastrointestinal

45
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:26,750
disorders obesity and especially

46
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:30,519
autoimmune disorders the same group did

47
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,739
a subsequent study again showing that

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,560
there are also anatomical differences in

49
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:38,689
Apes the colon is greater than 50

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,620
percent of the intestinal volume versus

51
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:44,840
only 20 percent in humans it's clear

52
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,939
that several bacterial lineages have

53
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:52,670
seemingly followed evolutionary wise

54
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:56,840
with hominids over the last 15 million

55
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:59,268
years and again in industrial nations

56
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,739
humans Harbor the fewest general of any

57
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:06,140
primate on their to Bacteroides ACI

58
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:09,650
lineages and apes that have never been

59
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:13,369
found in the American human subspecies

60
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:15,620
as I like to call it that severity of

61
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,780
irritable bowel symptoms is inversely

62
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,560
related to the gut bacterial diversity

63
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:25,930
so this definitely has importance to

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,689
disease so what is a person to do well

65
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,980
I'd suggest these things first

66
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:33,310
probiotics that may be familiar to some

67
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:38,090
of you these are oral supplements of

68
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:40,640
beneficial gut bacteria that can be

69
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,640
supplied as capsules or in fermented

70
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:47,238
foods especially kefir lacto fermented

71
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,699
vegetables to replace the kind of thing

72
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,799
that is missing and then you need

73
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:55,099
something that those bacteria like to

74
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,969
eat and those are probiotics these are

75
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:02,689
oral vegetative matter into justice and

76
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:04,579
fiber fructooligosaccharides that serve

77
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:10,039
as a feedstock for the beneficial

78
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:12,140
bacteria some other studies looking at

79
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:16,879
the relationship between the microbiome

80
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:19,759
and psychology when people ingest bifida

81
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,909
bacterium and lactobacillus probiotics

82
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:27,348
it reduces negative mood a treatment for

83
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:30,260
depression probiotics these special

84
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:31,699
bacteria in elderly patients improved

85
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:33,740
attention and working

86
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,829
memory is compared to placebo and that

87
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,530
was statistically significant there's

88
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:41,599
some diseases particularly Clostridium

89
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:44,299
infections that are treated with fecal

90
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,580
transplantation when this was done in

91
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,310
autistic children there were

92
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:51,529
improvements in the behavioral and Gi

93
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,470
signs and symptoms over the course of

94
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:58,629
the ensuing eight weeks presumably this

95
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,630
is something that needed to be repeated

96
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:05,750
again the gut microbiota these different

97
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:08,620
bacteria fact neuropsychiatric status on

98
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:12,370
in such conditions as autism depression

99
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,019
stroke and schizophrenia and the

100
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,360
mechanism of action seems to be mediated

101
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:20,240
through the autonomic nervous system the

102
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,509
enteric nervous system the immune system

103
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,759
on relates to bacterial metabolites and

104
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:30,370
I'm going to suggest now that there's a

105
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:34,069
role for the endocannabinoid system here

106
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:37,670
again we've seen marked changes in the

107
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:39,889
human diet as compared to past centuries

108
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,259
on at the same time we've had

109
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:45,949
skyrocketing rates of chronic disease

110
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:48,409
specifically obesity inflammatory bowel

111
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:51,620
diseases other autoimmune diseases

112
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,230
allergies diabetes cancer depression and

113
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,439
neurodegenerative disorders and these

114
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,939
were not rare in past centuries merely

115
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,550
because we're living longer

116
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:05,529
it's demonstrable that they're more of

117
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,970
these per the population

118
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:10,939
apparently it's necessary to have

119
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,880
multiple probiotic species not single

120
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:17,329
ones to protect against pathogenic

121
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:23,060
bacteria like clostridia and to gain

122
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:26,060
these neuropsychiatric benefits so

123
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,540
additionally probiotics may help control

124
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,860
p-part gamma this is a nuclear receptor

125
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,260
you're going to be hearing a lot more

126
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:39,069
about it regulates gene transcription

127
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:43,909
recently was shown that cannabidiol and

128
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:44,599
also thca tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid

129
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,150
are

130
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,760
agnus of this receptor and it's been

131
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:52,779
called the master regulator of a Depot

132
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,069
Genesis the production of fat also

133
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:57,349
regulating tumor necrosis factor alpha

134
00:06:55,069 --> 00:07:01,370
which is important in autoimmune

135
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:04,070
diseases and in inflammation free

136
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,610
biotics so this vegetative matter that

137
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:11,449
the bacteria like changed the microbiota

138
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,790
to reduce fat production and stabilize

139
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:16,370
the gut so that it doesn't leak and

140
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:19,879
allow toxic metabolites standar the

141
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:22,399
bloodstream we also know that CB to the

142
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,730
non-psychoactive cannabinoid receptor

143
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:28,029
levels correlate to concentrations of

144
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,800
lactobacillus what's in yogurt and

145
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:35,000
negatively with cluster aerial species

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,069
that are often pathogenic a study that

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,220
directly relates to the under

148
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:43,310
cannabinoid system it's this one from

149
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:47,420
2007 lactobacillus acidophilus common

150
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:52,430
component of yogurt a specific strain of

151
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:55,370
that was administered and induced CNR to

152
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,790
that's the gene that produces the cb2

153
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,750
receptor it's RNA expression above that

154
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:05,290
in the human h t29 epithelial cells and

155
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,180
that was statistically significant so

156
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:11,569
they demonstrated that as well as an

157
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,620
enhancement of morphine's pain-killing

158
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:19,339
effects in rats highly statistically

159
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:22,819
significant and that reduction in pain

160
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:27,949
was inhibited when a cb2 antagonist was

161
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:31,159
administered so that fits together a

162
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:35,659
very interesting study from 2011 looked

163
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:38,200
at obesity in cannabis users and non

164
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:41,990
cannabis users what they found was

165
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:46,310
obesity rates were only 14 3.3 percent

166
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,409
and 17.2 percent respectively among

167
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:51,709
participants using cannabis at least

168
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:55,189
three days a week such a one-third

169
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:57,680
reduction over nine users additionally

170
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,790
those who use cannabis had

171
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:05,659
significantly better body mass indices

172
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:09,889
do you know what yours is another study

173
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:14,480
directly relating cannabinoids to this

174
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:17,208
issue was done in Calgary on published

175
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,009
in 2015 by Nina Clooney and the group

176
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:24,469
there di o mice have a genetic

177
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:27,860
susceptibility to obesity they gain

178
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:32,060
weight on the same dietary intake that

179
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:34,970
doesn't affect others when administered

180
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:38,439
THC that altered their microbiome

181
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:42,200
balance affecting the Firma cuties and

182
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,480
Bacteroides ratio the THC essentially

183
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,379
prevented a ratio increase or weight

184
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,389
gain despite being on a high-fat diet so

185
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,809
this could help explain what we observe

186
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:56,330
in humans as we'll see from these

187
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:59,899
demonstrations people use cannabis

188
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:03,320
suffer from a variety of stereotypes the

189
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:06,019
most common one is the cannabis user as

190
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:10,339
a lazy slacker stoner as we see in the

191
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:12,708
illustration but another one is this

192
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:15,470
that of the skinny hippie and you see

193
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:19,489
that he's got a grocery bag full of

194
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:22,490
vegetables hopefully the right ones but

195
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,129
the truth is that the skinny hippie is

196
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,709
the more accurate representation of what

197
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:34,009
a cannabis user is likely to look like

198
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:37,009
as opposed to the slacker stoner again

199
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:40,730
how do we change the way things are and

200
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:44,509
this destiny that our diet has seemed to

201
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:47,060
impose upon us well in this prebiotic

202
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:49,159
array you see some vegetative matter

203
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,039
that may be quite unfamiliar to you

204
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:54,828
starting with acacia fiber in the upper

205
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,919
left chicory roots sometimes use as a

206
00:10:54,828 --> 00:11:00,349
coffee substitute Sun chokes otherwise

207
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,129
known as Jerusalem artichokes then

208
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:09,250
dandelion greens burdock and then the

209
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:12,909
more familiar Lda CI your onions leeks

210
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:16,950
and garlic all of these feed the

211
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:16,949
beneficial bacteria and the gut

212
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:22,360
additionally another thing that's

213
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:25,389
changed about our diets is our

214
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,659
vegetables have become tasteless in

215
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:31,090
ancient times people ate what they could

216
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:35,019
gather and it included a lot of bitter

217
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:37,180
herbs and these are largely fallen out

218
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,250
of the diet particularly Americans like

219
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:43,000
things that are sweet and not bitter

220
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:46,779
this can be supplemented with herbal

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,970
bitters as demonstrated in the photo and

222
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:50,679
it's been shown that these are present

223
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,320
not only in the tongue but throughout

224
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:56,079
the gut and specifically in the brain

225
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,960
where they do such things as reduce

226
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:03,700
hunger drive that drive toward sugars

227
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:08,440
and also seem to correlate with reducing

228
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,990
such disorders as diabetes and even acne

229
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,950
in the face so the question is can

230
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:17,409
bitter herbs allay hunger via the

231
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:19,180
hypothalamic and ECS mediated mechanisms

232
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:21,789
and lead to weight loss and counteract

233
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:26,129
the metabolic syndrome and type 2

234
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:29,370
diabetes I believe the answer is yes

235
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:32,019
here are a couple of books on how to eat

236
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,820
nourishing traditions by Sally Fallon

237
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:36,699
which first came out in the 90s but

238
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,580
still presents a very relevant diet on

239
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:43,450
the more recent bestseller by Perlmutter

240
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,879
called brain maker correlating use of

241
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:49,270
this kind of diet with prebiotics and

242
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:51,570
probiotics to improvements in autism and

243
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:55,269
a variety of other neurologic conditions

244
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:58,089
my hypothesis would be that we're seeing

245
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:01,299
common mechanisms between the prebiotic

246
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:05,440
and probiotic diet and what cannabis can

247
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:08,919
do and this has led to this diagram that

248
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,890
was published last week what I like to

249
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:16,539
call the gut or grand unified theory

250
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:20,250
that relates the microbiome to treatment

251
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:22,110
of various diseases including especially

252
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,230
beta-amyloid for

253
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:28,200
maisha neurofibrillary tangles that are

254
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,959
associated with Alzheimer's disease and

255
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,329
a variety of other neurodegenerative

256
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:36,389
conditions and as you see from the

257
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:39,500
diagram it's not only beneficial

258
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:42,028
bacteria but there's abundant evidence

259
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:46,980
presented in the paper but not here

260
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:51,870
today that supplemental THC CBD and even

261
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:56,459
THC a may do similar things in a laying

262
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:58,850
these type of afflictions so this

263
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:00,929
suggests a new approach to neurological

264
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,940
therapeutics I have always said

265
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:05,278
throughout my career that it needs to be

266
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:09,060
a preventive and therapeutic specialty

267
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,000
rather than just a diagnostic one to

268
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:14,239
provide better treatment for epilepsy

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,860
tumors Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's

270
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,450
traumatic brain injury and crow meant

271
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,430
sorry chronic traumatic encephalopathy

272
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,050
part of this includes aerobic activity

273
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,979
which is known to stimulate the

274
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:31,500
endocannabinoids system education

275
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:35,220
throughout life seems to help prevent

276
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,559
dementia and above all an

277
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,410
anti-inflammatory prebiotic and

278
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:44,399
probiotic diet that should emphasize

279
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:47,969
saturated monounsaturated that's olive

280
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:52,230
oil as we heard previously also omega-3

281
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:55,040
essential fatty acids bioflavonoids from

282
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:58,110
things like berries fermented foods

283
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,599
protein and minimizing carbohydrates

284
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,949
which have only been used in abundance

285
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,670
by humans for about 3,000 years

286
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:08,458
additionally this can be supplemented

287
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:11,879
with cannabis extracts providing the THC

288
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:13,289
CBD THC a carry off lean and other

289
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:18,279
select terpenoids

290
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:21,039
3 minutes remaining well we made it

291
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:23,439
so I guess people can come to the

292
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:30,879
microphones then I'll attempt to answer

293
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:34,140
questions I did not plan that for to

294
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,139
come out within seconds

295
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,459
any questions

296
00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:11,170
the microphones on this please talk

297
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:14,429
closer and Bacteroides level is a good

298
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:17,019
one in in that I would have lower

299
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:19,870
Bacteroides and higher for nikah ditties

300
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:21,730
if you took that and Transplant it and

301
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,509
did a fecal transplant into someone

302
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:28,629
obese what would happen they were to

303
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:31,389
expect an improvement and their weight

304
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:33,429
and intakes but again it might be a

305
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:36,879
temporary phenomenon now it works the

306
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:39,819
other way there is a rodent model of

307
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:42,309
Parkinson's disease and when you take

308
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,610
the fecal matter from the affected mice

309
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:48,189
and put it in those that that aren't

310
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,110
affected they become symptomatic so this

311
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,900
is being used a lot now in

312
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,600
gastroenterology practices to try and

313
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:58,720
improve situation the most common

314
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,120
situation is treating cluster aerial

315
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,220
infections that it really recalcitrant

316
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,279
and a lot of that is a function of

317
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,589
antibiotic use and I would point out

318
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:10,839
that part of the reason we're having so

319
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:13,449
much trouble with these autoimmune

320
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,059
disease is not just changes in diets but

321
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:19,630
overuse of antibiotics that are

322
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:22,329
suppressing normal and minute desirable

323
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,380
bacteria so follow-up question I was

324
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,960
surprised it and talked about

325
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,030
antibiotics more in this talk because

326
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,029
well we only had 15 minutes
