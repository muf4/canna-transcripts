1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,000
thank you so much for coming to can med

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:09,419
2019 and spending your day here with us

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,370
thank you for I mean even just showing

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,519
up to this panel it is not easy to show

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:16,378
up anywhere at 2:00 p.m. on a Tuesday

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,269
usually you know you've got work driving

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,220
your kids around to soccer practice

8
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:21,778
picking them up from school or you know

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,788
maybe you have to go to school and

10
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,980
you're here instead which is actually a

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,189
very very special thing the fact that

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,719
you are deciding to educate yourself

13
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,539
about the power of the plant which is

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,399
pretty phenomenal if I mean if these

15
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,500
people definitely are proof of that

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,878
you know educating educating about the

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,450
plant is the only way we're going to

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,128
tackle this industry tackle this space

19
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,950
and do it right education is the only

20
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,988
way before we go any further I'm gonna

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,609
introduce myself my name is Mary carrion

22
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:52,529
and I am a journalist and I've been

23
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:55,049
covering the cannabis beat for about

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,480
five years and I'm currently the editor

25
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:59,578
at Mary Jane where we cover everything

26
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,049
from culture and science news everything

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,850
in the candidate space if you don't know

28
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,640
us you should look us up you can find us

29
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,530
at Mary Jane comm so as I was saying

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,890
education is the reason why we're here

31
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,629
today and we are at a pivotal moment in

32
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,420
history where education is going to

33
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:17,099
change everything so like I said you

34
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,079
guys are here today to become educated

35
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,149
and we are here to talk about how

36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,030
cannabis is going to be incorporated

37
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,180
into the education system and that is

38
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,930
historic we are everyone who is here

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,280
today is also making history and you

40
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,290
know the fact that we're able to sit

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,629
here in this kind of ballroom experience

42
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,820
is a very unique thing we wouldn't be

43
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:40,709
able to do this 20 years ago or even

44
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,508
less than that not too long ago we were

45
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,719
not able to do this so this is a very

46
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,728
very big deal being here today is proof

47
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,560
of how powerful lifting the chains of

48
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,209
prohibition is even if it's only a

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,740
little bit look how much we're able to

50
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,408
do look how much we're able to do with

51
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:58,109
just a little bit of leeway and imagine

52
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,700
how that's gonna be in 10 15 20 years

53
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,890
it's gonna be it's going to be a great

54
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,390
thing

55
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,640
another thing us being here today is

56
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,209
proof that the government isn't always

57
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,788
right

58
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,318
and the fact not that we need any more

59
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,589
examples of how the government isn't

60
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,259
right

61
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,479
but you know it's proof that there's a

62
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,889
need for it's a proof that there's a

63
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:18,659
need for education it's a proof that

64
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,419
there's a need to know about the plant

65
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:24,060
and move forward to progress into what

66
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:27,329
this whole industry is going to become

67
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,129
and I feel lucky to bring this kind of

68
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,310
education through a stacked group of

69
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,359
rock star panelists and I would like to

70
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,069
give them a round of applause

71
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,450
[Applause]

72
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:41,339
like I said they could be doing anything

73
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:43,459
today and they're here they're here with

74
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,840
us so that's a really great thing and

75
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,849
thank you all for showing up today this

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,159
is a really great experience you guys

77
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,289
are just as much of rock stars for

78
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,250
showing up and showing your love for the

79
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:58,409
plant so thanks for that and before we

80
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,389
get into our discussion I'm going to

81
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,829
briefly go over a PowerPoint just so

82
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,829
everybody is on the same page and we

83
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:08,819
know what we're discussing and yeah so

84
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:12,599
let's get into that all right so who is

85
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:15,238
on this panel we have well we originally

86
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,439
had some people on this panel but do we

87
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,739
have new people on the panel we have

88
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:28,079
Caroline McCallum who is here tell us a

89
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:30,599
little bit about yourself Caroline Allen

90
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:35,939
nope can you hear me okay sorry bit

91
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:39,329
closer okay hi everyone I'm Caroline and

92
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,099
I'm a physician I have done my specialty

93
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,129
training in internal medicine and I

94
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:47,219
focus on complex pain and I do addiction

95
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:50,400
and complex disease I formerly in my

96
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:53,068
training worked as a pharmacist and so I

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,379
bring a combination of skills and I'm

98
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:58,858
working out of Vancouver BC in Canada

99
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,060
and obviously we've got some some things

100
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,370
that are a little bit different up there

101
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,139
in terms of cannabis regulation so I'm

102
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,250
hoping today I'll be able to draw on a

103
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,480
lot of those experiences and perhaps we

104
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,519
can have a discussion about what

105
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,159
opportunities may be possible in the US

106
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,930
in the future yeah so having Caroline on

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,129
our panel with us is a phenomenal thing

108
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,049
because she's going to be able to

109
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,519
provide some differences in terms of

110
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,679
where the United States is currently

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,319
and where the United States can be later

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,569
using Canada as a mirror in terms of

113
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,030
education and the freedom that they have

114
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:37,408
up there in terms of cannabis and we

115
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:37,408
also have dr. David Berman in a minute

116
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,900
okay

117
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:54,000
that inauspicious beginning I'm a

118
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:57,359
physician I been practicing medicine for

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,399
over 50 years

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,098
part of that has been doing addiction

121
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:06,638
medicine I've been doing cannabis

122
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:10,269
medicine for 20 years as well as pain

123
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,280
management I in addition to being a

124
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:14,079
clinician about half my career has been

125
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:19,269
in his administrator at all levels of

126
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:21,939
government I am an author push in my new

127
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:24,339
book cannabis medicine I think a big

128
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:27,339
great text book it was written in

129
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:29,888
combination with the nurse specifically

130
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:32,399
with the idea of it being a textbook I

131
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:36,069
also have other books in the history of

132
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:39,519
drug laws and the way drugs have been

133
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:42,658
used in society and one of the things

134
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,769
that's disturbing to me is how little

135
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:48,848
physicians know about the

136
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:50,649
endocannabinoid system it's arguably the

137
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,949
largest neurotransmitter system in the

138
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:54,929
human brain central homeostasis

139
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,919
modulation speed of neural transmission

140
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,788
important in the functioning of the

141
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:04,870
immune system and it touches on an

142
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:08,379
enormous spectrum of illnesses and it is

143
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,750
frankly criminal that so few medical

144
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:13,389
schools actually discussed the

145
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,310
endocannabinoid system let alone talk

146
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:18,579
about the medical utility of cannabis

147
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,728
and that's very very true and now we

148
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:24,399
also have a doctor Tom foulin who is

149
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:25,359
joining us today and we're really

150
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,370
grateful he's here

151
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,740
thanks Mary yeah absolutely everyone

152
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,050
ComEd I'm excited to be here this is my

153
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,250
first year presenting on a panel you

154
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,960
will have the opportunity to hear me

155
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,360
talk later about cannabis hyperemesis

156
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,339
syndrome

157
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,069
the five o'clock panel and I was asked

158
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,779
in last minute to fill in for Daniel P

159
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,529
Emily who couldn't be here a little

160
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,929
about myself

161
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:51,039
I'm a neuroradiologist by training I

162
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,750
graduated medical school in 2007 and

163
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,879
through a personal story one of my

164
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,728
siblings became quite ill with northern

165
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,110
mewn disease and ultimately cannabis

166
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:02,209
proved instrumental in his

167
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,330
rehabilitation and continues to you

168
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:07,038
until this day as part of my second act

169
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:09,019
in medicine in addition to being a

170
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,019
neuroradiologist I maintaining clinical

171
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:15,109
practice in cannabis / cannabinoid

172
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:17,659
medicine my focus is on Leo blastoma

173
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,340
patients given my neuro Radiological

174
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,580
training and interest in all things

175
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,619
neurological but I'm also educating

176
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:26,569
myself and taking on clients with

177
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,240
anything from autism to low-level

178
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:32,719
anxiety to medication reconciliation in

179
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,879
seniors all things cannabis an

180
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,289
endocannabinoid system and just echo

181
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,569
what dr. yerman

182
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:40,909
and dr. McCallum were saying it is

183
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:43,550
absolutely cruel that we have physicians

184
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,460
graduating medical schools as I did in

185
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,098
2007 not learning a single thing about

186
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:51,168
one of the largest systems in our body

187
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:54,019
absolutely and that brings us pretty

188
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:55,399
much to our next point here is you know

189
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:57,259
the fact that the endocannabinoid system

190
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,879
is the large is one of the largest

191
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:01,069
systems in our body and in our brains

192
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,168
and the fact that no doctors are being

193
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,579
taught about this I mean that needs to

194
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:06,560
change given how many people are using

195
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:10,848
cannabis and some startling statistics

196
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,680
are the fact that only 13% of only 13%

197
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:15,168
of medical schools even mention the

198
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,848
endocannabinoid system according to a

199
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:21,829
survey by dr. David Allen and only 9%

200
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:24,110
report teaching only 9% of universities

201
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:26,180
report teaching about medical marijuana

202
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,389
according to Washington University's

203
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,479
School of Medicine and ultimately only

204
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:34,759
out of 172 medical schools in North

205
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,139
America of which 101 replied to a

206
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:41,059
specific survey 66% were 66% were

207
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,929
reported that they were not equipped to

208
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,848
prescribe

209
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,489
or even answer questions about medical

210
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:49,070
marijuana so 90% of doctors aren't

211
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,899
learning anything about the medical

212
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:55,278
about medical marijuana in school and

213
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:56,778
that's very alarming yeah I mean we

214
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,889
that's a problem that's a problem it

215
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:59,330
needs to get fixed and that's why we're

216
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:04,759
here today so that's that's really

217
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:06,350
wonderful and so we'll go through this

218
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,480
very quickly you guys but what is the

219
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,490
endocannabinoid system just to get

220
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,620
everybody up to speed is basically a

221
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,750
biological system composed of

222
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,480
endocannabinoids in the body which are

223
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,190
neuro transmitters that bind to

224
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,580
cannabinoid receptors through our

225
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,500
vertebrae yeah through our vertebrae and

226
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,970
through the nervous system they bind to

227
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:32,059
cb1 and cb2 receptors and yeah it's

228
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,649
again it controls homeostasis it impacts

229
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:35,719
that help a healthy operating immune

230
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,809
system and impacts our sleep health so

231
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,889
it really impacts a lot of things and

232
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:44,599
yeah okay so I'll just leave this on the

233
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:46,580
board for you guys for now but these are

234
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,980
the schools that are currently offering

235
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,480
courses on cannabis and these are not

236
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,759
all of them but these are some of them

237
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,690
and they are pretty major universities

238
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:58,789
but still not enough so now we're going

239
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:02,330
to get into some of these questions that

240
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:05,899
I have and for the first question I will

241
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:08,150
ask is for our wonderful panelists how

242
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,069
do the current federal how does the

243
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,500
current federal status of cannabis

244
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:16,580
impact the various forms of education

245
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,339
that you are allowed to pursue please

246
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:22,970
Caroline okay I'll start

247
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:26,660
so coming from the Canadian experience

248
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,730
from this angle I I was joking to Mary

249
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:30,949
when we were just chatting earlier I was

250
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,950
like what do you mean like how does this

251
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,720
impact basically it hasn't affected my

252
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,060
practice of cannabis over the past five

253
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,399
years because we've recognized at a

254
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:42,500
federal level a medical cannabis system

255
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,870
it has gone through multiple changes

256
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,820
over the years and now it's a lot easier

257
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,730
for patients to get medical cannabis

258
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,650
than it used to be the axis has has

259
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,800
evolved dramatically and we now have

260
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:57,079
over 170 companies growing met

261
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,629
Cannabis sorry they've been licensed but

262
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,899
in various stages of growing and so for

263
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:04,820
me it's been really easy honestly

264
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,860
however with legalization for

265
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,700
recreational purposes at a federal level

266
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,350
which occurred last fall in 2018 now

267
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,990
we're seeing even greater need for

268
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,750
education so I don't really feel like

269
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,180
I've had red tape in terms of my ability

270
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,000
to educate but just the need is just so

271
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:26,299
much greater and I think one of the the

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,429
big issues that I'm facing or just the

273
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:30,949
difficulties I'm having is with

274
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:32,989
redundancy so unfortunately we're not

275
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,839
speaking to one another at the various

276
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,570
levels so there are federal groups or

277
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,360
sorry like federal programs different

278
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,600
provincial or state programs different

279
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,730
associations and stakeholders and

280
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,740
universities all creating very similar

281
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,329
things and it's really unfortunate

282
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,269
because I just think we could combine

283
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:55,399
and be stronger and get more experts

284
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:58,759
involved instead of trying to do our own

285
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,070
version kind of on our own instead of an

286
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:05,149
a-team so I wouldn't really say there's

287
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,920
any barriers to to creating educational

288
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,419
opportunities in Canada but it's just

289
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,159
been that we're not really working

290
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:11,750
together as well as we could yeah and

291
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,639
you guys have the definitely a level of

292
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,409
freedom that we don't have here and that

293
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,379
freedom it I mean I'm sure that's

294
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:21,319
extremely overwhelming today it's more

295
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:24,409
than the federal government

296
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,740
it's the 70 year history of stigma

297
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:31,219
that's been attached to cannabis most

298
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,259
people are unaware that in 1937 the AMA

299
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,629
testified vigorously against the

300
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,939
marihuana Tax Act and in that testimony

301
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:41,028
said the AMA knows that no dangers from

302
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,220
the medical use of cannabis in terms of

303
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:45,198
medical schools most of them won't touch

304
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,079
talking about cannabis with a ten-foot

305
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:50,958
pole because many of them are reliant on

306
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,948
federal funding and they have no idea

307
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:59,479
what the federal government will do so

308
00:12:53,948 --> 00:13:01,969
as the reason to hub up over whatever it

309
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,670
was that Trump did do or didn't do we

310
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,870
can see that there's a lot of subtlety

311
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:09,389
in terms of

312
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,759
encouraging or discouraging people do

313
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:15,330
certain things and medical schools are

314
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:18,360
discouraged from even doing research

315
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:21,900
about cannabis doctor Donald Abrams who

316
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,700
is an oncologist at UC San Francisco for

317
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:27,000
about eight or nine years submitted a

318
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,100
proposal to NIDA to demonstrate whether

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,799
or not cannabis was beneficial in

320
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:38,909
treating the pain and their neuropathic

321
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:42,419
pain from AIDS and finally the director

322
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:45,600
of NIDA said Don you have to submit a

323
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:47,189
proposal showing the dangers of cannabis

324
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,528
not the benefits because we're the

325
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,200
National Institute of drug abuse not the

326
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:55,830
National Institute of drug use so in

327
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,690
listening to researchers talk about the

328
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,089
difficulties that they've had they've

329
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,430
been enormous and it's very difficult to

330
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,680
even do research with whole cannabis

331
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:09,179
much of the research that's been done is

332
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:13,739
with isolates or with Marinol or with

333
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:17,459
CBD alone and as folks in nimbin which

334
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:20,009
has the longest drug war protest of all

335
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,810
second longest after Seattle they had a

336
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:24,269
sign there saying the plant the whole

337
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:28,309
plant and nothing but the plant and I

338
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:31,980
think that there's a great problem in

339
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:33,629
the medical schools utilizing the plant

340
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,370
the whole plant and nothing but the

341
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:37,789
plant and talking about the plant

342
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,919
they're much more likely to talk about

343
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:44,129
the pharmaceutical ization of this plant

344
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:47,009
and I think that also represents a very

345
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:51,000
in addition to the stigma and the money

346
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:55,110
that the federal government wheels so on

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,629
that note what do you thin of medical

348
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:03,089
education dr. fallin so I'll take this

349
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:05,338
as Mary pointed out earlier at 2017

350
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:08,130
study at have seen this University in

351
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,930
Washington found that mine percent of US

352
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:11,338
medical schools out of the 101 that

353
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:12,659
responded we're actually teaching

354
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,190
anything about the endocannabinoid

355
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:17,669
system and I believe another statistic

356
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,020
there was 85% of students didn't feel

357
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:20,519
comfortable I just

358
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,960
saying cannabis with their patients so

359
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,490
we have this really weird situation

360
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,320
where we have 33 states which have

361
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,570
legalized in the District of Columbia

362
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,860
and in many cases I would say most

363
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,590
everyone in this room knows more about

364
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,750
their local doctor does about cannabis

365
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,420
which is just an unacceptable and an

366
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,250
untenable situation and as dr. Berman

367
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,110
points out a large part of this has

368
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,730
nothing to do with the fact that there's

369
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,500
nothing to teach about cannabis or that

370
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,310
you know the endocannabinoid system is

371
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,620
not implicated in autism in fibromyalgia

372
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:51,629
in migraines it has to do with the

373
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,850
stigma that cannabis is a drug and just

374
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:55,769
like how we all are aware that NIDA will

375
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,840
not Commission a study or approve it

376
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:00,090
unless it is focused on the harms of

377
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,009
cannabis and we all heard from dr. Sulak

378
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:05,430
earlier today talking about a crutch

379
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:08,009
versus a tonic and you know these really

380
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:09,419
important key concepts for cannabis and

381
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,120
it just becomes increasingly obvious

382
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:14,939
every year that the status quo is

383
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,409
unacceptable but what does portend hope

384
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,220
and give us room for hope is as we see

385
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,980
on the screen here

386
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,180
all of these colleges that you know ten

387
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,860
years ago would not have been teaching

388
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:25,109
about cannabis or taking it seriously

389
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,730
the writing's on the wall so I certainly

390
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,759
think that nine percent number is going

391
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,200
to continue to increase and one of the

392
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,669
issues that has talked about with

393
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,770
incorporating this into the medical

394
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:36,539
school curriculum is well they say where

395
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,480
we're going to find the 10 to 20 hours

396
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:40,949
of coursework and no joke this is an

397
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,570
actual thing that's being discussed

398
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,040
even with pharmacy schools who are also

399
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,820
looking to incorporate cannabis

400
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:50,129
education what are they going to give up

401
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,290
so you know that's just where the the

402
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:54,659
the conversation is that but certainly

403
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:57,000
as we said given our increasing

404
00:16:54,659 --> 00:17:00,000
recognition of the ECS it's plio

405
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,109
capacity the many different targets CB 1

406
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,180
CB 2 GP r 5 v t RP v all of these

407
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,399
receptors again there's just no way

408
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,880
we're going backwards on this so forward

409
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,509
momentum

410
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,360
so carolina tonight say one more thing

411
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:19,170
which is that the doctors out there

412
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,000
recognize that they don't know i've had

413
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,580
more than a hundred doctors in southern

414
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,099
Santa Barbara County refer patients to

415
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,079
me because they feel uncomfortable not

416
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,459
because just because of their lack of

417
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,500
knowledge but because

418
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,350
of the stigma that's associated with

419
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,509
this and I've tried to do see me and we

420
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:37,798
have done we've got an organization

421
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:39,808
called the American Academy of

422
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:44,129
cannabinoid Medicine if anybody wants to

423
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:46,668
collaborate with us from Canada we need

424
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:50,370
to have more of these kinds of

425
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:52,350
conferences and we need to integrate

426
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:54,808
this into like pain management

427
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:57,349
conferences and they have seen some

428
00:17:54,808 --> 00:18:00,569
gradual improvement so I think that

429
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:02,189
there we are making progress but I'd

430
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:04,379
like to see it be a lot more rapid

431
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,880
because there's no excuse for the status

432
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,289
quo

433
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,390
absolutely and Caroline what is your

434
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:11,548
involvement in the education system in

435
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,140
the university system in Canada and how

436
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:16,889
is it there how is it how does it differ

437
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:20,640
from what we're doing here so I do

438
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:24,630
educate on a number of different levels

439
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:28,860
and with different groups of people yeah

440
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm I'm really close is this on sorry

441
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:34,979
okay

442
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,919
okay I'm really close sorry

443
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,808
so at the University currently I teach a

444
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,960
couple of lectures for the School of

445
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:44,879
Pharmacy so particularly I'm working

446
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,250
with the they've got a pain curriculum

447
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,860
so I do a lecture there I also lecture

448
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,169
in there with some fibromyalgia and

449
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:54,359
other complex diseases in their in their

450
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:57,330
curriculum and in the medical school

451
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,609
actually not at the undergraduate level

452
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:02,519
but at the post get at the postgraduate

453
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:04,979
level I actually take the fellows in my

454
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:08,190
clinic so I frequently get geriatric

455
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,950
fellows pain medicine fellows I've had

456
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:13,649
an orthopaedic fellow also palliative

457
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,090
care so these areas are obviously areas

458
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:16,648
where we use quite a bit of medical

459
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:19,259
cannabis but I'm actually getting

460
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:21,269
interest from pediatric fellows so these

461
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,879
are residents and their final years of

462
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:25,440
training which is really great and so

463
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,940
they come to the clinic sometimes

464
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,340
they'll spend a few days maybe up to a

465
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,649
month with us and really learning a lot

466
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,569
about the plant and so I think that

467
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:35,369
that's been a really big win for us that

468
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:37,500
at the clinic where I work is actually

469
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:40,229
considered a clinical teaching site by

470
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,058
the University were recognised I'm

471
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,909
surprised that it didn't take quite as

472
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,428
much work as I

473
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:47,349
suspected they were pretty open to it

474
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:49,119
because especially in Vancouver where I

475
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:51,308
am there's just so much cannabis use

476
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:53,168
that's really what we focus on is that

477
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:54,908
your patients are doing this anyway

478
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:56,799
so let's try to equip the physicians

479
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:58,749
with the right information so I would

480
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,668
say those are largely the two areas I'm

481
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:03,308
educating but we really need to get it

482
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:06,249
into the formal curriculum so this would

483
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:09,069
be the undergraduate program like dr.

484
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:11,079
fallin has already mentioned but I am

485
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:12,460
teaching some academic cough days as

486
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,470
well so that's a three hour lecture

487
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,298
block that I get for those specialties

488
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,429
that I've mentioned so certainly we are

489
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:20,200
seeing some changes and that's been I

490
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:24,099
think really beneficial to show that

491
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,808
this is or certainly seeing greater need

492
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:27,729
and actually the fellows are going to

493
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,378
their program and demanding it so I

494
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:31,149
think that that's how it's gotta go I

495
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:34,199
can't just tell them what they need also

496
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:36,758
having the students recognize it as well

497
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,798
um one of the things you know we're

498
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,499
talking about professional training here

499
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:44,108
but there's no reason why this shouldn't

500
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:47,739
be taught in high school and in junior

501
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:50,949
colleges me what why should we wait

502
00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:52,659
until people get to medical school or or

503
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:58,119
nursing school I mean we're talking

504
00:20:52,659 --> 00:21:00,970
about a very amazing substance that has

505
00:20:58,118 --> 00:21:04,358
this incredible broad array of

506
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:07,149
applications as evidenced by you're

507
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:11,678
talking about the different specialties

508
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:14,258
that come and see you and people doctors

509
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,080
are hungry for this kind of information

510
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:19,989
I had three physicians from Ohio that

511
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,898
spent several days with me I had doctor

512
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:26,379
from London that spent some time with me

513
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:30,598
and we need to set up more fellowships

514
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:33,069
and more opportunity not only for

515
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:35,259
students to learn by the what's your

516
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:38,499
method by by working with the doctors

517
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:40,179
that are that are in the field one of

518
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:42,098
the things that I might mention his

519
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:44,048
years ago I started a speaker's bureau

520
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:48,009
on sex education at the University of

521
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:50,618
Washington and the faculty OBGYN faculty

522
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:50,940
and psychiatry faculty said look the

523
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:54,299
amount

524
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,700
students are meeting once a month for

525
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,309
three hours to talk about human

526
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,350
sexuality don't you think we can have a

527
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:03,419
few more hours in the curriculum so I

528
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:06,359
think that organizing the medical

529
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:09,150
students to demand this or even to self

530
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,759
educate themselves by inviting people

531
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:15,140
like the people on the podium here dr. P

532
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:18,000
Melanie or what have you is one way to

533
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,830
help move things forward you also have

534
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,359
to have people on the inside like dr.

535
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:27,629
ple and like Bob Solomon who can lobby

536
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:30,869
for having more time in the curriculum

537
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:33,870
and has been pointed out here there is a

538
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:36,959
lot of competition for face time with

539
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:38,209
medical students on that note yeah

540
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,769
absolutely

541
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,110
what what do you think we can do to get

542
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,970
medical schools and universities to

543
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:47,129
teach about cannabis like what is there

544
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:52,170
anything that we can do either either

545
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:53,940
students or as professors or doctors so

546
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,620
I'll comment on that I think it's

547
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,789
already occurring right here in

548
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:01,889
California UC Irvine UCSD in UCLA

549
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:04,500
medical student associations focused on

550
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:08,310
cannabis cannabis as medicine there's

551
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,650
the canvas initiatives famously

552
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:12,419
occurring at UCLA with Shiva Cooper and

553
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,910
so this is generating excitement and

554
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,769
also by virtue of you know can Medicare

555
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,810
and all of these canvas conferences

556
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:21,359
people are actually approaching us now I

557
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:22,740
get many emails that and phone calls

558
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,269
texts like doc following we think what

559
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,980
you're doing is very exciting

560
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,690
you know I'm currently working at the

561
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,079
State University of New York I'm in

562
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,279
discussions with them about potentially

563
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,679
talking to their medical students about

564
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:39,089
cannabis so really just by virtue of

565
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:40,529
being an advocate for you know the

566
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:42,240
status quo for the fact that patients

567
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:43,799
are using this substance anyway

568
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,190
and really kind of just shaming the

569
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,809
medical establishment into understanding

570
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,920
that look there's two ways about this

571
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,089
your patients why are they going to use

572
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,620
cannabis and you're going to know

573
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:53,849
nothing about it or your patients going

574
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:57,869
to use cannabis and you're going to know

575
00:23:53,849 --> 00:24:00,569
about it and you'd be you know with that

576
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:02,250
tact we actually are achieving progress

577
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:04,178
where we're all around the country I

578
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,429
believe just recently this month and

579
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:08,379
Florida one of the osteopathic schools

580
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,879
they're just incorporated the teaching

581
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:10,898
of medical cannabis for the first time

582
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:13,418
into their curriculum

583
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:16,148
I know Miami Dade Community College just

584
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:17,590
started incorporating some classes so

585
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:19,298
the change is occurring but it's

586
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,428
incumbent upon all of us to continue

587
00:24:19,298 --> 00:24:24,220
pushing for this change to continue

588
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:25,990
talking about that you know as again dr.

589
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,700
Sulak mentioned today how cannabis you

590
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,509
know it changed my life and the amount

591
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:33,009
of times we hear this from patients is

592
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:35,558
just overwhelming in fact you almost

593
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:38,558
believe like it's a can report one of

594
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:42,220
you mentioned patients and I think that

595
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:45,908
that's an important focus you know in in

596
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,990
California we're the Wild West and a lot

597
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:49,028
of physicians that are making

598
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,528
recommendations for cannabis aren't

599
00:24:49,028 --> 00:24:52,868
really practicing medicine

600
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:54,909
they're just minting money they're

601
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:59,048
spending 10 minutes or 15 minutes with

602
00:24:54,909 --> 00:25:00,879
the patient and not fairly often some of

603
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:03,819
these patients come and see me and spend

604
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:05,528
another hour with me it because they

605
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:08,168
don't understand how it works

606
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:11,378
patients want to know how cannabis works

607
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:13,509
they want to know why it works they want

608
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:15,638
to know what it treats they want to know

609
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:18,519
what dose they should take they want to

610
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:21,908
know what to do if they get high these

611
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,528
are all things that people like those of

612
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:26,169
us up here that have worked with

613
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:29,048
patients over time have come to learn

614
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:31,350
and come to understand through hard work

615
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:34,109
through listening to the patients and

616
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:37,329
there should be a more solid foundation

617
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:40,748
for us to do this rather than having to

618
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:44,079
spend years of experience or digging

619
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:46,839
into dusty books to find the answers

620
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:50,109
that were that we're looking for we

621
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:52,178
really need to directly assault the

622
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:56,678
stigma remember that the marihuana Tax

623
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:59,528
Act was passed for economic reasons

624
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,570
because DuPont and the petrochemical

625
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:03,069
industry was concerned about competition

626
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:06,249
from him it had nothing to do with

627
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:09,158
marijuana just I think I'd be remiss not

628
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:10,600
to mention you know law schools as well

629
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:12,309
and so we're gonna start to see even

630
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:14,918
pharmacy schools and nursing schools and

631
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:17,529
and so forth them psychology and and and

632
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,000
the works but just to mention I weave

633
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:21,069
we're both recently talking about

634
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,630
medical legal cases and certainly the

635
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:25,299
need for physicians who are

636
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:28,020
knowledgeable in cannabis for a medical

637
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:31,119
purpose re for medical legal purposes so

638
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,799
certainly testifying and I almost get a

639
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,799
request every week for something of that

640
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,319
nature which is a huge amount of work to

641
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,759
do especially because you really do have

642
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,529
to be able to go through all the

643
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,019
evidence and and to be able to support

644
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:47,799
the case so I have also been asked to

645
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:50,170
speak for a lot of law societies just as

646
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:51,399
a as a as an evening event but I think

647
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,769
we're gonna start to see that in their

648
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,360
curriculum as well for sure so how

649
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:57,579
important do you think it is then that

650
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,309
medical schools and law schools and you

651
00:26:57,579 --> 00:27:02,079
know the various forms of schools how

652
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:08,500
important it is for them to work

653
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:13,599
together well I suppose that the law

654
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:17,430
schools that they already are trained in

655
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:21,099
terms of dealing with substance issues

656
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:23,500
there's a standard textbook that was

657
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:28,649
written by the former dean in the law

658
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:38,259
school a bit Santa Clara Journal Dolman

659
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:40,570
and the you know just as McCallum

660
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:43,960
McCallum Calum I get a straight here

661
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:47,589
just like dr. McCallum said there are I

662
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,710
have spoken to legal groups usually the

663
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:53,589
groups of defense attorneys and the

664
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,420
interesting thing in regards to the

665
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,949
cases that I've been involved in there's

666
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,019
a couple of interesting things one is is

667
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,490
that you get exposed to things that you

668
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:02,349
wouldn't get exposed to in the clinical

669
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:06,690
practice of medicine you can ask some

670
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:14,349
unusual questions but the other thing is

671
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:20,110
how often the defendant is obviously not

672
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:23,319
guilty of the offense and I I've written

673
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:27,119
my reports in the hope of educating the

674
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:29,999
district attorney to get them to either

675
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,219
you know I have a more reasonable plea

676
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:34,069
deal or to drop the charges and

677
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,079
generally speaking I haven't been that

678
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:40,138
effective at educating the district

679
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:43,439
attorneys through my reports but there I

680
00:28:40,138 --> 00:28:47,548
think it's critical for particularly

681
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:50,548
prosecutors and and law enforcement

682
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:53,339
personnel to be familiar with this the

683
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:56,668
other problem is is that we are stuck in

684
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:59,128
medicine with a lot of people who hold

685
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:02,159
themselves out to be experts and are not

686
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:03,990
and I know the California Highway Patrol

687
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,950
had such an expert I won't mention the

688
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:10,048
band's name but he created his own

689
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:13,798
research which wasn't very well done and

690
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:16,378
that was then integrated into standard

691
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:18,749
police policy he he was the guy who said

692
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:20,969
if you smoke marijuana you get a green

693
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:24,200
tongue can I have a show of hands of how

694
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:26,639
many people had seen green tongue okay

695
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,940
can I just add one more point on to that

696
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:31,319
because I think we could go all day you

697
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,090
just prompted me on a couple of other

698
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:34,798
things so I think what's really

699
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:36,269
important when you ask you know the

700
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:37,798
medical schools in the law schools and

701
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:40,319
and how that could happen

702
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:42,509
is that what I notice especially doing

703
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,980
the three cases I did one on impairment

704
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:46,589
one on anxiety and one on pain

705
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,389
specifically was that I really couldn't

706
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:50,519
give them an answer until I explained

707
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:52,138
the science of the plant like I they

708
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,138
just want a one-pager and it doesn't

709
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:56,490
work that way so in actual fact I was

710
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:58,558
really in Clutton for punishment because

711
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,450
the first case I wrote 60 pages and I

712
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,089
included a dictionary of terms

713
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,340
I had the ten clinical pearls that you

714
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:07,740
need to understand understand what I'm

715
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:09,778
even talking about and then all three

716
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,490
cases I was actually doing a rebuttal of

717
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:14,519
other physicians opinions which were

718
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:17,548
completely wrong they were psych

719
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,589
psychiatrists and so therefore the

720
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:21,929
person had anxiety so cannabis must be

721
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:24,480
inducing the anxiety not that she's

722
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:27,179
using cannabis to treat the anxiety so

723
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,528
really for law for them to be able to we

724
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,210
each have to help each other because

725
00:30:28,528 --> 00:30:31,019
they don't even know the science yeah

726
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,639
absolutely

727
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,169
absolutely it goes back to also what you

728
00:30:32,638 --> 00:30:36,538
were saying about there is no

729
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:37,740
communication happening between between

730
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:39,210
the various groups of people who are

731
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,589
either governing cannabis or teaching

732
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,960
about cannabis and there's

733
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,668
redundancy as a result yeah I just want

734
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,740
to piggy tell one point on that which is

735
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:48,559
that a lot of the there's a lot of work

736
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,240
going on like now with this

737
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:54,839
toxicologists called Ryan Moreno where

738
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,548
every day on Twitter he debunks these

739
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:58,319
news stories where police report that

740
00:30:56,548 --> 00:31:00,028
police went to a site and he picked up

741
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,528
some fence Melanie passed out and he

742
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:02,970
overdosed and we're even seeing these

743
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:05,970
stories coming out of a defense Nilla

744
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:08,100
laced cannabis believe it or not where

745
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,870
was talked about and so it is incumbent

746
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,369
and especially important for those of us

747
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,949
within the medical community with

748
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,928
knowledge of cannabis to be active on

749
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,340
these forums and talking about the

750
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:21,480
ridiculousness and you know non

751
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:23,009
possibility of these things and also

752
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,690
just to add on as well they think the

753
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:26,308
current state I practice in New York

754
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,200
currently and in New York if you

755
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:30,359
recommend medical cannabis there's four

756
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,919
hours of required seeing me so in

757
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,748
addition to the medical schools and

758
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,549
teaching there we also want to be

759
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:36,868
teaching at the state levels but if you

760
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:38,249
have a state cannabis program

761
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:41,038
how are those physicians getting

762
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:44,129
educated at that point so in California

763
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,599
there is no such requirement and in

764
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,480
Canada there's no requirements at all

765
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,519
either to to authorize cannabis which is

766
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,519
very different when you look at programs

767
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:55,288
like suboxone programs or methadone when

768
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,990
you must have you know ten hours or

769
00:31:55,288 --> 00:32:00,359
whatever number and so really this issue

770
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:02,159
of competencies and having standardized

771
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,709
programs that actually meet the needs

772
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,778
for the prescribers I think are very

773
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:11,909
important so yeah Tom that's a great

774
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:13,409
point just to caroline point in the u.s.

775
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:14,789
we can't call ourself prescribers

776
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:17,009
because it's utterly illegal to

777
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:18,839
prescribe we are merely the recommenders

778
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:22,440
that cannabis may you know may be

779
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:25,668
beneficial for you so yeah the reason

780
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,929
that we could recommend is that

781
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:30,509
fortunately the Constitution does not

782
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:32,129
say when you get your MD degree you lose

783
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:34,528
your First Amendment right to free

784
00:32:32,128 --> 00:32:35,969
speech so if somebody asks you what do

785
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:38,368
you think about cannabis as a medicine

786
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,798
you can say I think it's great I think

787
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:44,028
it's awful I have no idea but the

788
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:47,450
government cannot put a gag

789
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:51,769
over you over your mouth forget what the

790
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:53,569
heck I was going to say we were talking

791
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:56,120
about prescribing and actually in Canada

792
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:58,460
it's called authorizing I Islip there

793
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:00,229
and I wasn't sure what how you guys word

794
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,909
it but basically because cannabis

795
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,288
doesn't have a DIN number so a drug

796
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:05,840
identification number which

797
00:33:03,288 --> 00:33:07,609
prescriptions do you can't prescribe it

798
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,168
so it's not a typical prescription pad

799
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:11,269
you're using it's called an

800
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:13,730
authorization and so again speaking to

801
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:15,950
doctor Sulak this morning that like you

802
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:19,099
know these single molecules this is what

803
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:21,169
add in an infirm is really going towards

804
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:23,119
us making a single chemical entity

805
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:25,700
designed to work in a certain way on a

806
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,229
certain receptor which you know does

807
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,509
obviously work for a number of

808
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:32,058
conditions but for a number of the

809
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:33,769
conditions were seeing you do need a bit

810
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:35,450
of a shotgun approach and we don't fully

811
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:38,058
understand how the plant works but

812
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,069
that's okay because my patients have you

813
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:42,918
know ten to twenty symptoms I'm managing

814
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:45,048
and you know using 10 to 20 medications

815
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,340
just doesn't make sense and they've

816
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:48,740
already tried them and they're not

817
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:51,019
working so you know this idea of a drug

818
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,359
and prescribing even this kind of

819
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,429
nomenclature we're speaking cannabis is

820
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,138
just in such a different category it's a

821
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:59,090
different medicine it's really hard to

822
00:33:57,138 --> 00:34:03,528
relate to it as you know how we've been

823
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:07,428
doing with other prescriptions because

824
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:10,550
the we have marginalized all plant based

825
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:13,119
medicine and I call that the cult of

826
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:17,480
modernism which came about in the 1920s

827
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:20,240
as we begin to marginalize plant based

828
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,030
medicine and rely more on single

829
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,559
entities one other historical note is

830
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:28,129
cannabis was in the United States

831
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:30,799
pharmacopoeia from 1854 until 1942 and

832
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:32,598
it was available in every drugstore in

833
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,269
the country matter of fact at the turn

834
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:37,190
of the 19th the 20th century cannabis

835
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:39,829
was the third most common ingredient in

836
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:44,030
patent medicines and prescriptions after

837
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:46,068
opium and alcohol so we and in the 1920s

838
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,510
American doctors wrote two to three

839
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:50,570
million prescriptions a year that

840
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,610
contain cannabis in fact my father was a

841
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,250
assist and he was at the University of

842
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,320
Minnesota School of Pharmacy in 1928 and

843
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,570
one of their assignments was to make

844
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,430
tincture cannabis and he said and we had

845
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,200
to be very careful because the alcohol

846
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:06,039
was illegal

847
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,179
[Laughter]

848
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:10,429
Wow Wow

849
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:11,809
so so there's a lot of Education that

850
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:13,730
happens between doctors and their

851
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:16,929
patients and there's yeah do you guys

852
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:19,460
mind going into that a little bit so

853
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:22,129
something I think is really important is

854
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,990
this idea of knowledge translation so we

855
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,490
can speak about the evidence here and

856
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:27,409
about studies and and high-level

857
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:29,779
discussions but patients don't

858
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:31,940
necessarily understand that language and

859
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,700
so it's how do we move this information

860
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:38,090
you know from from that area into the

861
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:40,399
general public and I think something

862
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:42,769
that I'm becoming a bit better versed in

863
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,200
is opinion editorials so I've been

864
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:47,710
fortunate enough in Canada to get a

865
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:50,839
couple published and so really trying to

866
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:53,179
tackle an area of controversy so I've

867
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,370
done one on psychosis in cannabis as

868
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:58,069
well as Pediatrics in cannabis so really

869
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:59,960
going for for the big areas of concern

870
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,420
and saying you know I recognize that

871
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,130
there's there's issues but hang on like

872
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,380
let's actually talk about this in a

873
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:08,450
logical fashion and bringing some of the

874
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,490
evidence into play that you know I can

875
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:12,379
make it such that they understand and

876
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:15,139
not focusing on all the nitty gritties

877
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,420
so I think that patients when they hear

878
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:20,119
it from that kind of lens that it lands

879
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,490
a bit better but certainly in our clinic

880
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,989
we spend 45 minutes with patients our

881
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:26,299
counsellors spent an incredible amount

882
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:29,299
of time and it's really challenging

883
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,400
because you know clinics you've just

884
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,760
mentioned a lot of them you know they do

885
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,780
it in a different way than we do it and

886
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,340
patients suffer when they don't get

887
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,230
adequate information and then they

888
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,420
actually end up coming to us because

889
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,579
they've taken too much cannabis because

890
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,280
they weren't taught how to use it and so

891
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:47,750
then their their gut reaction is I'm

892
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,820
never going to do that again and it's

893
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,349
really unfortunate because with some

894
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,630
education they could have a very

895
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:56,960
different experience so the patient

896
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:59,180
education is just so key and this even

897
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,480
brings into play what Dustin was

898
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:03,899
speaking about earlier lower dosing and

899
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,690
you know you don't need to be

900
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,970
and all those kind of controversy will

901
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,980
not really controversy but patience

902
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:12,959
concerns there the first thing they say

903
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,548
when they come in our clinic and we

904
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,170
really can't address them adequately

905
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:21,538
with with education I'll just I

906
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,759
completely agree I mean you know we're

907
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,559
learning you mean this is a can med

908
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:26,818
conference but just even to look at

909
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:29,400
psilocybin and what we're learning

910
00:37:26,818 --> 00:37:31,318
they're equally important as the use of

911
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,349
psilocybin and something dustman again

912
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:36,449
pointed out to a set and setting and you

913
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:38,700
know the other key concept in campus low

914
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:40,618
and slow all these things were famously

915
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,719
we remember Maureen Dowd going to

916
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:44,999
Colorado back and whenever she went and

917
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,459
consuming a hundred milligrams of THC

918
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:50,368
and you know feeling like she was dying

919
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,778
and we don't recommend that okay we're

920
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:53,009
much on the order of one milligram

921
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:54,929
two milligrams if you're going to be

922
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:57,778
starting with an edible and then waiting

923
00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:59,548
an hour and as Caroline pointed out we

924
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:01,739
do our initial intake with patients at

925
00:37:59,548 --> 00:38:04,920
solace MD which is my cannabis company

926
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:06,899
we spend an hour just giving them the

927
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,999
lay of the land in terms of in terms of

928
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,769
what are your receptors what's your ECS

929
00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:13,169
explaining the concept of bespoke

930
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:15,598
medicine explaining the concept that

931
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,730
cannabis is not one thing it's much more

932
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,619
than the THC and CBD you may have heard

933
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,869
about in CBD that's everywhere of

934
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:25,140
questionable quality and all these other

935
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:28,289
concepts but again in in the same way

936
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:30,960
that satin setting are essential to

937
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:32,880
psilocybin and therapeutic use the same

938
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,190
is true of cannabis and using with

939
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,759
intent and using the smallest amount

940
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:40,470
possible to achieve your desired outcome

941
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:43,679
one of the things I want to mention is

942
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:47,219
that probably the most effective thing

943
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:49,409
in getting physicians to recognize the

944
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:51,719
medical value of cannabis is their

945
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:53,518
patients asking them about it and I

946
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:55,409
think that one of the things that we

947
00:38:53,518 --> 00:38:57,689
need to do is healthcare professionals

948
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:59,518
is to ask our professional schools why

949
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,769
they're not teaching about the

950
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:04,919
endocannabinoid system and about the

951
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:08,578
medicinal use of cannabis you know the I

952
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,349
remember scene in a cover article in

953
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:14,280
High Times in 1975

954
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:17,019
had a list of medical conditions that

955
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,180
they said that cannabis was useful in

956
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:21,190
treating and to tell you the truth I

957
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:23,319
thought well that's interesting that's a

958
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:26,860
nice tactic in terms of legalizing the

959
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:30,400
recreational use and then shortly after

960
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:32,710
that I looked at these things more

961
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,170
closely and the more I looked at it the

962
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:38,230
more I realized that yes all of those

963
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:43,510
conditions and more respond to the use

964
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:46,719
of cannabis and we are saddled with this

965
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:50,530
stigma because the laws have been used

966
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:52,659
to marginalize discriminated against

967
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:56,080
groups and that's not unique for

968
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:59,230
cannabis I mean it goes back thousands

969
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,599
of years to trying to marginalize the

970
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,420
pagans or trying to marginalize the

971
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,889
midwives that were known to the Pope as

972
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,190
witches

973
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:12,009
so dealing with the stigma is important

974
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:15,190
and what's really important is to do

975
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:17,890
what doctors up here have done and that

976
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:20,380
is to stand up and speak out you don't

977
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:23,049
have to be obnoxious you don't have to

978
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,900
be abrasive what you need to do is extra

979
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:31,150
lover choose of science and we are in an

980
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:33,579
anti-science era where 98% of scientists

981
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,490
say there is global warming and yet the

982
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:42,190
president United States is selling

983
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:44,679
plastic straws for $15 a piece that you

984
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:47,650
know leads me to a whole other question

985
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:49,629
and point is uh what responsibilities do

986
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:59,800
institutions have to help shape an

987
00:40:49,630 --> 00:41:01,329
equitable future in cannabis I I'm an

988
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,519
idealist so I would say they have a

989
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:04,869
great responsibility you know one of the

990
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,759
things that's being discussed which of

991
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:08,170
course may be a little controversial is

992
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,420
the whitewashing of the cannabis

993
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,550
industry and the fact that we have so

994
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:15,039
many predominantly people of color and

995
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,420
Latinos in prison for maybe selling a

996
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,759
dime bag and yet we have other

997
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,430
enterprises that are predominantly male

998
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,040
predominantly white doing very well in

999
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:25,440
the nascent cannabis and

1000
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:27,739
so certainly I think there's a role that

1001
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,809
we don't whitewash or forget the history

1002
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:32,489
as dr. Bierman has talked about that had

1003
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:35,250
nothing to do with the health of people

1004
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:38,309
are the safety of people are the welfare

1005
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:40,769
of people and so I've again I've

1006
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:42,360
encouraged as I'm sure all of us are to

1007
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:44,250
go against the grain to continue asking

1008
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,300
the questions to continue spreading

1009
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:49,710
unpopular truths to get involved and

1010
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,960
yeah I don't give the institutions and

1011
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:54,119
in slack as we're learning but MIT

1012
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,650
recently that accepted money from a

1013
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,179
known pedophile

1014
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,490
we certainly to be keeping an eye on

1015
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:01,259
institutions and questioning where their

1016
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:08,939
money is coming from and questioning

1017
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:12,900
what their narratives are look let me

1018
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:16,530
say also that one of the problems that I

1019
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:18,119
think we need to fight in with cannabis

1020
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:22,410
is the pharmaceutical ization of

1021
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:25,230
cannabis you know doctor McCallum talked

1022
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:27,210
about the difficulty in treating the

1023
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:29,490
plant as though or a single molecule

1024
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:31,619
medication while it's not and we've only

1025
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:36,689
had single molecule medication since

1026
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:42,569
1897 and people we have had some

1027
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:46,170
breakthroughs these pre 1897 plant-based

1028
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:48,809
medicines were effective for for many

1029
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:50,550
things and I think part of the problem

1030
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:54,090
and I hope I'm not stepping on too many

1031
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:55,860
toes here is we have people who have got

1032
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:58,530
their priorities reversed where they're

1033
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:00,990
looking at making the money first in

1034
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:03,540
helping the people later and frankly I

1035
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:05,759
think you can do better for society and

1036
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:07,650
actually better for your bottom line if

1037
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,980
you put the patient first and that's

1038
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:13,440
really what education of the medical

1039
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:17,030
schools and nursing schools is important

1040
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,030
so that we can put the patient first

1041
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:24,659
yeah absolutely so what do interested

1042
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:26,429
professor up professors and institutions

1043
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:30,109
need to know before adding cannabis as

1044
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:30,109
an option for degrees or courses

1045
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:40,568
well one of the things that we should do

1046
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:42,969
is to lobby state legislators in

1047
00:43:40,568 --> 00:43:45,219
medical-legal States for them to pay for

1048
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:48,099
research about the endocannabinoid

1049
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:51,039
system this will have people in the

1050
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:52,289
medical school you know that have a

1051
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,839
horse in the race

1052
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:58,599
we also as dr. McAllen pointed out

1053
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:00,489
should require physicians who are making

1054
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:03,219
more than say a handful of

1055
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:07,449
recommendations to have 8 to 12 hours of

1056
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:10,059
continuing medical education and one of

1057
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:12,639
the questions that we talked about in

1058
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:14,380
preparing for one of the most important

1059
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,719
things we need to do in order to get

1060
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,969
cannabis taught in medical schools the

1061
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,559
medical schools are very concerned about

1062
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:22,929
how their students do in the national

1063
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,269
boards so we need to lobby the National

1064
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:27,159
boards to have a couple of questions on

1065
00:44:25,268 --> 00:44:31,988
the endocannabinoid system on the

1066
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:34,389
national boards and one other thing I

1067
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:36,579
want to say before I forget it is one of

1068
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:39,458
the questions is what can we do and what

1069
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:41,739
can you do and it seems to me that one

1070
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:44,948
of the persons that has been hurt by the

1071
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:47,108
stigmatization is dr. Massoud and I

1072
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:49,959
think that what we need to do is lobby

1073
00:44:47,108 --> 00:45:00,308
for dr. McCollum to receive the Nobel

1074
00:44:49,958 --> 00:45:03,458
Prize for science so just another point

1075
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:07,859
kind of on the same topic is also

1076
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:07,858
considering other institutions so at

1077
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:13,420
everybody give a round of applause to

1078
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:16,328
Professor Robert Solomon who is at the

1079
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,338
UCI Center for the Study of cannabis who

1080
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:20,469
made it today and it's our big deal that

1081
00:45:18,338 --> 00:45:21,759
he's here who's not walking in late by

1082
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:24,999
the way no nope uh-uh

1083
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:27,028
absolutely not wonderful it is great to

1084
00:45:24,998 --> 00:45:30,248
have you here thank you thank you um

1085
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:33,309
yeah so now that we have a leak a

1086
00:45:30,248 --> 00:45:35,889
clinical attorney present we can open

1087
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:37,959
the discussion to the elements of law

1088
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:41,199
that play into incorporating cannabis

1089
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:45,248
into the education system okay I hope

1090
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,360
heard the question right so it's in my

1091
00:45:45,248 --> 00:45:49,299
position

1092
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:54,519
it's very different than when we talk

1093
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:56,830
about education of cannabis at a any

1094
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:59,679
different level because I'm at a

1095
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:02,799
professional school and we care in very

1096
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:06,250
rough terms about how to learn to be a

1097
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,519
lawyer passing the bar exam and getting

1098
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:13,449
a job and so I don't see cannabis law as

1099
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:16,690
being any different than say sports law

1100
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:18,549
or entertainment law it's a specialized

1101
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:22,480
field where we have specialized

1102
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:24,820
knowledge and I said to the Dean a few

1103
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,460
years ago after attending a conference

1104
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:29,950
we really need a course in cannabis law

1105
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,860
because there are jobs out there and it

1106
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:35,859
is a specialized field to which the Dean

1107
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:39,430
said great you're right find someone to

1108
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:42,370
teach it and so thus I offer the first

1109
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:45,339
cannabis law course in the country at a

1110
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:48,699
law school so why is it important well

1111
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:53,200
for one thing this is a highly regulated

1112
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:55,629
field and highly regulated fields mean

1113
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:59,319
among other things full employment for

1114
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:01,930
lawyers it is very hard to negotiate not

1115
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,570
that that's a good thing but it is very

1116
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:07,750
hard to negotiate this field without a

1117
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:11,430
without a lawyer it's also true that we

1118
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:14,769
have very specialized tax law affecting

1119
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:19,269
you sought to pay taxes if you have a

1120
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:22,630
sale of illegal federally illegal drugs

1121
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:27,940
and there's very complicated law by the

1122
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:30,309
way cannabis businesses paid 5.2 billion

1123
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,409
dollars in taxes to the federal

1124
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:35,519
government last two years ago probably

1125
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:38,589
and most of that was guess what in cash

1126
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:42,400
imagine going to IRS with bags of cash

1127
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:44,800
we also have highly complicated internet

1128
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,309
law which of which applies to cannabis

1129
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,550
we have all kinds of rules affecting

1130
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:53,889
investors that are not in other areas we

1131
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:57,130
have incredible problems of local

1132
00:47:53,889 --> 00:47:59,859
control so the the cannabis board has

1133
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:00,250
held that although localities can

1134
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,559
prevent

1135
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,250
distribution and growing they cannot

1136
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:09,039
prevent deliveries in two municipalities

1137
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:11,320
guess what happened 24 municipalities

1138
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:14,139
are currently in litigation against the

1139
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:16,510
state so local control is a major major

1140
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:19,480
issue there's the whole question of

1141
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:21,790
federal preemption and what it means law

1142
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,619
students learn this right away then

1143
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:25,719
there's the problem of driving under the

1144
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:27,849
influence and what we mean by that and

1145
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:30,159
how we will measure that and I have a

1146
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:33,250
whole list somewhere on a slide I've got

1147
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:36,039
it for you there's more and you know I

1148
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:40,420
could I could teach two courses on this

1149
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:42,909
frankly but large law firms are now

1150
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:45,099
getting into the cannabis business and a

1151
00:48:42,909 --> 00:48:47,529
lot of it is similar to real estate law

1152
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:50,380
except there are particular wrinkles

1153
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:52,990
based on local local law and local

1154
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:55,390
control so it's a complicated area it is

1155
00:48:52,989 --> 00:48:58,119
a specialty it's going to grow it's

1156
00:48:55,389 --> 00:49:00,940
inevitable absolutely thank you for that

1157
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:03,339
so professor Solomon works with dr. paya

1158
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,019
Mele at UCI Center for the Study of

1159
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,970
cannabis which is very exciting and

1160
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:08,559
together they are tackling the cannabis

1161
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:10,299
space in a multidisciplinary fashion

1162
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,279
with the law school the neuroscience

1163
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,350
program and everything and it's they're

1164
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,550
doing incredible work in fact their

1165
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:18,639
school that they are putting together

1166
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:21,100
might be you know a model that other

1167
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,779
schools look to to figure out just how

1168
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:25,150
to make it all happen so that's also

1169
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:27,370
very very exciting and it's happening at

1170
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,710
UC Irvine Irvine in Orange County that's

1171
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:32,650
crazy it's a sign of the times oh my god

1172
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:34,480
can I just say one quick yeah I gave a

1173
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,480
talk at the Exploratorium in San

1174
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:41,650
Francisco and as I was leaving the

1175
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:43,780
subway the BART I could smell not the

1176
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,940
subway I am from New York area you can

1177
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:48,070
tell I could smell cannabis in the air

1178
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,050
and hear the Grateful Dead and my first

1179
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,840
thought was we're not in Orange County

1180
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,400
anymore

1181
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:58,690
[Laughter]

1182
00:49:53,400 --> 00:50:02,050
yeah that's great I was talking to mr.

1183
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:05,280
Solomon on the phone and started to get

1184
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:08,590
into some of the science and you

1185
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,090
suggested I'm taking a risk here because

1186
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,858
I'm going to

1187
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,260
say that I'm not sure that I agree that

1188
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:16,750
you felt that that defending or dealing

1189
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,390
with cannabis was similar to dealing

1190
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:22,469
with other drugs and I think that the

1191
00:50:19,389 --> 00:50:24,730
attorneys do need to understand the

1192
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:28,209
endocannabinoid system need to

1193
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:31,358
understand that THC is fat soluble in

1194
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,619
order to do their job well and maybe you

1195
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:34,779
have the same feeling and I

1196
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:37,990
misinterpreted what what you said but I

1197
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,849
think that some special additional

1198
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:43,000
education is would be helpful to

1199
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:45,160
attorneys in defending cases involving

1200
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,030
Canada yeah we don't disagree and in

1201
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:51,219
fact in my course daniele p.m. le

1202
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:54,010
presents two sessions on the science and

1203
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:55,839
our plan is next fall to to really

1204
00:50:54,010 --> 00:51:02,820
divide the course equally so the science

1205
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:07,660
is critical my point was that the skills

1206
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:09,670
are the same and trying a driving under

1207
00:51:07,659 --> 00:51:12,929
the influence of alcohol as drying

1208
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:15,550
driving under the influence of any

1209
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:17,409
chemical and the police aren't

1210
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,210
particularly concerned with what the

1211
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:21,399
chemical is we've had several sessions

1212
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:23,409
with law enforcement and what they are

1213
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,900
really concerned about is the field

1214
00:51:23,409 --> 00:51:27,848
sobriety test and the field sobriety

1215
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,400
test is you know you've all seen this on

1216
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:32,349
TV can you walk the straight line you

1217
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,769
know there there is something funny that

1218
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:38,710
they say there in fact it is somewhat

1219
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:41,050
true a joke I used to tell that I would

1220
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:43,269
rather have someone stop at a green

1221
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:45,730
light and drive through a red light and

1222
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:47,949
the police said that there actually is

1223
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:50,769
some truth to that one of the tests that

1224
00:51:47,949 --> 00:51:53,169
they give is turn your head back close

1225
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:56,139
your eyes and tell me when thirty

1226
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:58,269
seconds has elapsed and people who are

1227
00:51:56,139 --> 00:52:01,838
under the influence of alcohol will

1228
00:51:58,269 --> 00:52:04,509
often go okay and it's like five seconds

1229
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:07,269
and people who are under the influence

1230
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:09,490
of cannabis or you know something else

1231
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:11,739
suppressing their system will you know

1232
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:13,509
be back there and after a minute the the

1233
00:52:11,739 --> 00:52:16,719
officer will say how long has it been

1234
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:18,970
and they go oh gee only 15 seconds I

1235
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:21,730
thought you know so so are the the

1236
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,769
problem however according to tests and I

1237
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:25,539
do want to say to credit police too

1238
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:27,699
surprise they're very sophisticated

1239
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:30,130
about this here incredibly sophisticated

1240
00:52:27,699 --> 00:52:33,099
really obviously getting good training

1241
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:36,130
on the met on the medical side but they

1242
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:38,949
don't care that much but the real you

1243
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:43,390
well I'm talking to LA please so it's LA

1244
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:46,739
and and Orange County but to them the

1245
00:52:43,389 --> 00:52:49,059
difficult part is changing lanes

1246
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:51,849
changing lanes involves a lot of

1247
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:54,610
executive functions and if you're under

1248
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:59,769
the influence of almost anything that's

1249
00:52:54,610 --> 00:53:01,390
where the problems occur yeah I just

1250
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:03,099
like to make a comment on that and and

1251
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:04,629
while I agree with with the general

1252
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:06,159
concept you're mentioning under the

1253
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:08,590
influence it doesn't really matter what

1254
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:11,649
the substance is however what my concern

1255
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:13,329
is is if they start to do random checks

1256
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,160
so somebody's driving appropriately

1257
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:16,449
there's known signs of impairment and

1258
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,219
then they're gonna start looking for

1259
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:20,469
cannabis it's like well if you're going

1260
00:53:18,219 --> 00:53:23,019
do that then why don't you also check

1261
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:25,659
for morphine and for anti histamines and

1262
00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:27,909
anti nausea and other medications that

1263
00:53:25,659 --> 00:53:30,099
we absolutely know could cause

1264
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:31,779
impairment theoretically but you also

1265
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:33,639
have to understand that a medical

1266
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:36,430
patient who uses that medicine every day

1267
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:38,500
has a very different situation going on

1268
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:40,389
and this gets us into tolerance this

1269
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,309
gets us into what's actually crossing

1270
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:44,679
the blood-brain barrier and how their

1271
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:46,690
executive function is so they really

1272
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,489
need to be pulling over the right people

1273
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,110
and not just okay we're gonna check

1274
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:51,519
everybody for cannabis because it's

1275
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:54,690
Thanksgiving weekend or something like

1276
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:57,969
that I am going to take issue now

1277
00:53:54,690 --> 00:54:00,820
regarding the training of the Los

1278
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:02,889
Angeles Sheriff's Department there is an

1279
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:06,580
expert witness named Nick Moreau who was

1280
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:09,069
a retired LA County narcotics officer

1281
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:14,170
and he helped put together the drug

1282
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:16,720
recognition exam and said that it has no

1283
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:19,659
scientific basis there's also a lot of

1284
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:21,549
criticism of the field sobriety test now

1285
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:24,039
there is a new test coming out that

1286
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:30,850
seems to have some merit and it's a

1287
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:33,789
nickname druid Dr UID and it's the the

1288
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:35,239
thing about the police out there is they

1289
00:54:33,789 --> 00:54:39,139
have a very low

1290
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:40,519
are to go over they it's not the same as

1291
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:42,469
being in court and this is what the

1292
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:44,960
Chief of Police of Ojai said at a panel

1293
00:54:42,469 --> 00:54:46,549
that I was out we we don't have to prove

1294
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,769
that the person was driving in the

1295
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:50,930
influence beyond a reasonable doubt we

1296
00:54:48,769 --> 00:54:52,699
just need to have a suspicion I don't

1297
00:54:50,929 --> 00:54:56,389
know how strong the suspicion is and

1298
00:54:52,699 --> 00:55:00,169
that's a very very low bar and then you

1299
00:54:56,389 --> 00:55:02,449
start looking at the police report at

1300
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:04,840
the driving in some instances there is

1301
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:09,019
no description of the person's driving

1302
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:11,269
all you have is that the person failed a

1303
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:12,800
field sobriety test or in the case I'm

1304
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:16,340
working on now they actually passed the

1305
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:19,910
field sobriety test and they take a

1306
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:21,890
toxicology screen and of course the DA

1307
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:23,629
didn't go to medical school he doesn't

1308
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:25,819
know how to interpret the toxicology

1309
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:30,349
screen he bunny doesn't know that the

1310
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:32,330
cabinets are fat-soluable and you end up

1311
00:55:30,349 --> 00:55:36,110
with the problem and this is not a

1312
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:39,679
problem just with cannabis but when you

1313
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:41,269
the to a hammer everything is a nail to

1314
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:44,509
a police officer everything is a crime

1315
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:48,440
so if you have a stroke if you have a

1316
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:50,540
hypoglycemic episode if you previously

1317
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,960
had a traumatic brain injury and now the

1318
00:55:50,539 --> 00:55:55,190
police officer stops you they are likely

1319
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,380
to think that you're under the influence

1320
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:59,409
of a truck and if you're a regular user

1321
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,480
of cannabis which you might well be

1322
00:55:59,409 --> 00:56:05,899
they're going to draw your your blood

1323
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,840
now I think one of the best defenses is

1324
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:11,660
to ask for serial draws of your blood so

1325
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:14,329
that you can see that the THC is coming

1326
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:17,379
from the adipose tissue and not from the

1327
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:20,389
result of having recently smoked a joint

1328
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,800
Wow that's very interesting yeah that's

1329
00:56:20,389 --> 00:56:23,719
a great point I was gonna mention the

1330
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,490
same thing like being fatigued you know

1331
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:26,989
there's rules for how long you can't you

1332
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:28,759
can't drive well you can only drive for

1333
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:30,229
so many hours it's it's no different

1334
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,510
there are medical conditions that can

1335
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:33,980
cause impairment and actually my pain

1336
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,840
patients say that they are better

1337
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,849
drivers when they use some amount of

1338
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,380
cannabis I'm not saying use cannabis and

1339
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:41,329
drive but I think you need to look at

1340
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:43,579
the full picture and really understand

1341
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:45,920
what's going on and not have people in

1342
00:56:43,579 --> 00:56:48,848
court acting as scientists and and doing

1343
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,818
all this yeah they can really make Mis

1344
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:53,680
leading cause and effect and

1345
00:56:51,818 --> 00:56:56,440
associations and draw these conclusions

1346
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:58,179
that that may not be their thang so I

1347
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,700
have to wrap up here very quickly but

1348
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:02,828
one issue that I have to ask in terms of

1349
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:05,139
Education education across law education

1350
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:07,359
across medical and in the United States

1351
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:09,818
and in Canada how do you go about

1352
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:12,940
educating about pesticides and

1353
00:57:09,818 --> 00:57:17,048
pesticides in products and pesticide use

1354
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:20,139
among growing and also you know because

1355
00:57:17,048 --> 00:57:22,568
patients consume them well I don't think

1356
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:24,190
until the US has federal you know

1357
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:25,960
legalization you're gonna be able to get

1358
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,659
anywhere with these these issues that

1359
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:31,059
are very much all across the board

1360
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:33,038
applies to all states it's not just you

1361
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:34,660
know able to have an individual state

1362
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:37,329
rules on these sorts of things then you

1363
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:39,368
need to have mandatory lab testing more

1364
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:43,329
than just pesticides now with with fate

1365
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:44,890
you know vitamin E esters or acid eats

1366
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:47,579
and all these different derivatives that

1367
00:57:44,889 --> 00:57:49,538
that can also potentially have long-term

1368
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:53,019
outcomes we don't know

1369
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:56,859
so needing to get funding for levels for

1370
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:59,169
research so from we have cihr in in

1371
00:57:56,858 --> 00:58:01,838
Canada and you don't have to study abuse

1372
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:03,430
you can study other other parts of

1373
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:05,920
cannabis which is really important not

1374
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:08,219
to just be focusing on harm moving into

1375
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,349
looking at CBD looking at other things

1376
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:13,960
and not just recreational use looking at

1377
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:17,229
medical so I think that yeah it's gonna

1378
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:19,509
it's gonna be difficult unless you're

1379
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:20,768
United on on these issues in terms of

1380
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:23,559
how you're gonna go about getting

1381
00:58:20,768 --> 00:58:25,929
answers yeah I'm in complete agreement

1382
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:28,329
with Carolina and in fact if any of you

1383
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:29,978
who follow me on Twitter will you know

1384
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:31,900
have noted that I was recently arguing

1385
00:58:29,978 --> 00:58:33,998
with the Surgeon General about this very

1386
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:36,160
point so where he was saying oh you know

1387
00:58:33,998 --> 00:58:38,439
these kids are dying from vaping the

1388
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,639
marijuana cigarettes and the whole thing

1389
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,889
and we're like well actually you're just

1390
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:43,509
making the argument for federal tea

1391
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:46,509
scheduling for research and for

1392
00:58:43,509 --> 00:58:48,248
regulating these products so that we're

1393
00:58:46,509 --> 00:58:50,318
not producing 5,000 of these vape

1394
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:52,478
cartridges per week as was occuring in

1395
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,498
the state of Wisconsin which wouldn't

1396
00:58:52,478 --> 00:58:56,710
you know what they don't have medical

1397
00:58:53,498 --> 00:58:58,358
cannabis so it turns out people are

1398
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,639
resorting to these illicit products

1399
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:02,340
because they don't have

1400
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:04,279
says to tested regulated products and

1401
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:06,120
it's way beyond pesticides we have

1402
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,820
bioaccumulation potentially from

1403
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:10,769
solvents you taint hash oil so that's

1404
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:13,350
fine you use a vape in or whatever a

1405
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:14,610
product with vho one time it's no

1406
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,829
problem what if you're using that

1407
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:18,720
product everyday for years at a time and

1408
00:59:16,829 --> 00:59:20,519
you have this bioaccumulation occurring

1409
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:22,859
so really the way forward is D

1410
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:30,900
scheduling research regulation and

1411
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:34,950
testing when you take a look at the

1412
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:37,230
newspaper articles the they are there to

1413
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:40,769
sell newspapers they are not there to

1414
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:43,079
educate people and they often don't read

1415
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:46,469
the research they may read the press

1416
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:50,159
release about the research and there

1417
00:59:46,469 --> 00:59:52,379
tends to be sensationalization people

1418
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,949
have been vaporizing cannabis for

1419
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:59,160
thousands of years I mean they found

1420
00:59:54,949 --> 01:00:05,429
things were was used in religious

1421
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:07,649
services as an incense and so we've got

1422
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:10,679
we've had the historic Bickle volcano

1423
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:14,760
that's been around for 25 30 40 years

1424
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:16,230
that uses the whole cannabis and they

1425
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,650
are part of our problem in this country

1426
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:21,900
is we really don't regulate it

1427
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:24,539
industrial production of just about

1428
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:27,059
anything that's dangerous as strongly as

1429
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:30,389
it should be I mean one of the things

1430
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:32,039
that I tell people who are questionable

1431
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:34,019
about canvas they said it's too bad that

1432
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:35,699
we don't have these same questions about

1433
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:37,860
all of the other pharmaceuticals that

1434
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:40,469
are on the market I'd like to see those

1435
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:42,539
questions with the same intensity that

1436
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:46,469
we had cannabis because I would feel a

1437
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:49,590
lot safer as a patient we buy best

1438
01:00:46,469 --> 01:00:51,839
estimates we grow in California about

1439
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:54,390
three billion dollars a year worth of

1440
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:57,300
cannabis we sell legally about 1 billion

1441
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:59,400
dollars a year in cannabis I was in

1442
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:01,530
Berkeley this weekend and talking to

1443
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,690
someone and he was telling me about his

1444
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:06,780
cousin has a great business where he he

1445
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:09,300
grows and he delivers to someone who

1446
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,400
drives to Connecticut and I said that's

1447
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:13,690
you realize that's not a legal business

1448
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:16,660
and he said oh I know I didn't

1449
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:18,579
like that he was a legal grower well you

1450
01:01:16,659 --> 01:01:20,559
know our other 2 billion dollars is

1451
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:23,230
going somewhere and to make it worse

1452
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,420
within the state we have created all

1453
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:28,000
kinds of incentives to get license to

1454
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:30,490
sell and all kinds of disincentives to

1455
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,829
get a license to grow so there really

1456
01:01:30,489 --> 01:01:35,199
are incentives starting with tax where

1457
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:37,299
there is a reason as long as you can

1458
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:38,109
market your product to not market it

1459
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,110
legally

1460
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:44,800
and since the law requires a seed to

1461
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:47,769
sale being able to track it it's only

1462
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,960
the legal sales that are that are being

1463
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:52,300
tracked that way so you know we are in a

1464
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:55,480
transitional period we are everything

1465
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:57,250
I've said is not not me giving a radical

1466
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,309
opinion everyone knows this is the case

1467
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:02,349
and so we need to start working this out

1468
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:05,259
and we're still early in transitional

1469
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:07,690
systems but somehow we're going to have

1470
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:10,720
to figure out how to have a more

1471
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:14,380
equalized distribution center system and

1472
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:16,539
that is going to be based on a having a

1473
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:19,450
federal policy that in legal terms

1474
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:22,420
doesn't entirely suck because the

1475
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:24,460
current policy is totally insane it

1476
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:27,190
makes absolutely no sense it's based on

1477
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:29,260
racism it's based on trying to suppress

1478
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:31,750
groups of people it's based on putting

1479
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:34,000
people in jail and it's based on the

1480
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:36,639
just saying no policy well once you say

1481
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,710
just say no you're saying abstinence is

1482
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:40,900
the only thing that makes sense and that

1483
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:43,900
makes about as little sense in cannabis

1484
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:46,170
control as it does in birth control Wow

1485
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:53,160
one of the things I'd like to mention

1486
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:56,380
that that reminded me of is the stigma

1487
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:59,679
extends to the highest levels you may

1488
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:04,030
recall that former Vice President

1489
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:05,940
Biden's son died cancer and they did not

1490
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:09,970
use cannabis to try to treat his cancer

1491
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:13,809
and he set up this program to take a

1492
01:03:09,969 --> 01:03:15,579
look at options and so I sent him a

1493
01:03:13,809 --> 01:03:17,289
letter and said you know you might want

1494
01:03:15,579 --> 01:03:19,449
to take a look at cannabis it wasn't a

1495
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:21,250
you know outrageous or anything and I

1496
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:22,629
didn't even get the courtesy of a

1497
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:24,369
response

1498
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:28,510
you really have to wonder here's a man

1499
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:32,199
who lost his son to cancer and refuses

1500
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:35,200
to even respond or have a staff respond

1501
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:38,849
to a suggestion that they look into

1502
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:42,669
something that we have known since 1974

1503
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:44,500
can kill cancer cells and as dawn Abrams

1504
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:47,500
has said there's more than enough basic

1505
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:50,019
science research and anecdotal reports

1506
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:52,030
to justify doing double-blind studies

1507
01:03:50,019 --> 01:03:54,369
and it seems to me we're thinking about

1508
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:56,710
talking about teaching medical students

1509
01:03:54,369 --> 01:03:59,650
and nursing students pharmacy students

1510
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:03,070
about the endocannabinoid system one of

1511
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:06,160
the hooks to hang our hat on is the fact

1512
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:08,260
that we know we can say for a fact that

1513
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:10,839
cannabis will cure your Mouse's cancer

1514
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:12,490
but we can't say whether it'll cure your

1515
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,230
cancer as a human being because the

1516
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:16,349
double-blind studies have not been done

1517
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:20,760
except for one in England a glioblastoma

1518
01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:23,469
which was had some optimistic findings

1519
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,640
that's about all the time we have for

1520
01:04:23,469 --> 01:04:26,619
today we could talk about this forever

1521
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:30,000
thank you guys so much for showing up

1522
01:04:26,619 --> 01:04:30,000
thank you for being here
