1
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:11,120
hello everyone thank you for the

2
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:14,919
organizer to inviting me to here to be

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:17,320
with you it's great to be with you guys

4
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:22,079
and I think that would be great to take

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,439
a selfie with you guys please

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:28,518
smile

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,839
okay nice so today I'm going to talk

8
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:35,199
about the Canabis

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:37,238
what we do at the uh L University on the

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,399
uh cannabis genetics and genomics and

11
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:43,119
breathing and all other stuff but uh

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,000
first of all uh quick question Who I Am

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,238
it's been years I'm trying to see who I

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
am not successful but

15
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,399
professionally uh I did the under in

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,799
plant Sciences I've worked several years

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:00,600
on different Labs uh and even in the

18
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:04,000
level three Labs then get tired of the

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,680
uh bench work LAB Works and then got to

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,680
the computational biology starting

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,920
working on different types of the

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,680
genomics project and got my first

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,320
license in 2019 when when I was at

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,600
University of gu then moved to Laval

25
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:24,118
University to start a new program on

26
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,959
cannabis and uh officially I was the

27
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,920
first cannabis Prof in Canada uh mostly

28
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:34,879
working on cannabis

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,759
uh un laal University is the second

30
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:42,000
oldest university in America founded in

31
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:45,478
1663 is uh the largest French speaking

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,159
University in America uh located in a

33
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:51,959
beautiful Quebec City so we are mostly

34
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,640
French speaking

35
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,399
University what I'm going to present

36
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,718
here is the work of all these beautiful

37
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:03,920
people all the grad students uh

38
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,239
posts uh Greenhouse

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,719
text they've done a wonderful job

40
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,280
genomic platform and theic platform I'm

41
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,639
just here talking and presenting all

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,080
these

43
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:20,079
results uh in my theme we are focused

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,640
mostly on four different activities in

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,040
research and all of them are on Canabis

46
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,639
mostly we work on the omx Technologies

47
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,280
like diomix metabolomic transcriptomic

48
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,799
we're developing lots of different tools

49
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,840
Technologies to study uh different

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,439
phenomena using these

51
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,439
Technologies uh we have active breing

52
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,719
program actually we are the first public

53
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:46,079
cannabis breeding program in Canada when

54
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,680
we say in Canada in in the

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,640
world uh I have the largest

56
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,439
infrastructure to work on cannabis we

57
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:58,679
can have up to 6,000 plants so it's huge

58
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:01,239
uh so we do that uh we have uh fully

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,400
equipped and running genome editing lab

60
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,239
uh we had a wonderful talk by Mark you

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,519
know explaining all the basis of the

62
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,840
crisper and how it works uh one of the

63
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,719
question was how many jeans we can now

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,158
cut we were successfully to put in eight

65
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,479
jeans in one construct and do the

66
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:24,039
crisper uh on cannabis and it's a open

67
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,679
running and working progress and we have

68
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:29,959
a huge activities on Big Data machine

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,080
learning AI image processing and all

70
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,438
typing in my group it's been done based

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:40,640
on the image analysis 3D imaging and the

72
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:42,919
treatment of the uh images to understand

73
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:47,679
the different

74
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:49,839
traits so why cannabis in Canada Canabis

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,159
now is becoming the one of the top

76
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,719
economically important

77
00:03:52,158 --> 00:04:01,318
crops uh since legalization to

78
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:05,680
2022 uh it has contributed uh more than

79
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:10,518
43.5 billion to the Canadian

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,480
GDP this is equivalent to 25% of all

81
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,840
agricultural uh communities in Canada

82
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:20,599
and it has created more than

83
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:22,359
151,000 jobs agriculture is not creating

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,560
creating jobs but cannabis is doing

85
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:30,720
wonderful in that uh part it has a great

86
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,879
social impact in 2023 uh 27 7% of the

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,280
Canadian consumed at least once the the

88
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:40,918
the Cannabis 78% of this population

89
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,038
claim that they've consumed canies for

90
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:46,319
medical

91
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:49,879
purposes and 85% of these people they

92
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,918
consume the whole plant uh material so

93
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:56,038
it shows at what level cannabis is

94
00:04:52,918 --> 00:05:00,279
playing a great role in our

95
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:04,560
society but canas is a major CR

96
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:08,279
with a minor research for most of last

97
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,439
century it was uh banned we have done

98
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:16,119
nothing on cannabis it has been left

99
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:20,279
completely in dark uh we haven't used

100
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,319
any of the you know the Technologies

101
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:27,439
Innovation you know training

102
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:29,360
specifically uh I do lots of um uh

103
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,319
training or the presentation in

104
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,919
different

105
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,960
colleges of the College of Physicians

106
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:38,639
pharmacist nurses and unfortunately in

107
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:42,279
Canada for example the Physicians they

108
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,720
get trained only three hours over seven

109
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:48,318
years of their training on Canabis

110
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,319
nurses zero pharmacist zero and this is

111
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,720
bad and even the biologist or the

112
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:59,039
students in agriculture that we have a

113
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:01,639
very uh Pro big problem in training the

114
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:05,478
the the peer for working on

115
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,918
cannabis so in Canada it's been legal

116
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:08,918
but we are still in the dark after 5

117
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,439
years of

118
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:18,079
legalization for example in plant Gene

119
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:21,079
resources of Canada where we are keeping

120
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,959
115,000 plant species from all around

121
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:26,719
the world there is zero cannabis in that

122
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,719
gin Bank there is nothing and even we

123
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,360
can't contact these people and talking

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,880
of cannabis there is no Public Funding

125
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,319
the Ministries like the ministry of the

126
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:42,360
agriculture they don't even recognize

127
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,960
cannabis as a plant in their chart so

128
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,000
there's lots of problem

129
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:52,598
there however they have money to spend

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,439
on alcohol so Canadian government in

131
00:06:52,598 --> 00:07:00,159
2022 they've directly invested 16 166

132
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,719
million in the

133
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,280
uh wineries so there's lots of problems

134
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,720
there

135
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,318
but we are working on that to be on the

136
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,879
same page because this is a very common

137
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,680
problem when I'm talking with our

138
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,560
colleagues Physicians or nurses they are

139
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,918
getting mixed uh mixed up between

140
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,839
cannabis and THC in most of most of the

141
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:26,399
people they thinks cannabis THC and

142
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:28,399
there is one thing but they they are not

143
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,038
really understanding that the Cannabis

144
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:34,959
is plants we can't uh categorize based

145
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:38,478
on the product of the Cannabis the the

146
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:42,038
the Cannabis and to arrive to the effect

147
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,360
there is a long and complex process to

148
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:47,719
produce the

149
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:51,400
plants to do the P Post Service extract

150
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,639
the arrive to the final product and then

151
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,799
the later question is who and what they

152
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,519
are consuming the the the Cannabis

153
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,759
that's a big problem in most of the

154
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:06,240
clinical Tri when we were talking on the

155
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,479
medical side of the Cannabis all people

156
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,319
there are saying we are studying

157
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:10,800
cannabis but the first question is what

158
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,919
cannabis you are studying or which

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
cannabis you are studying and that's

160
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,680
again a big

161
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:21,519
problem uh that's the thing when we are

162
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,879
talking of the you know medicinal

163
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:27,959
cannabis uh that's a huge difference

164
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:30,639
between the modern medicines and the uh

165
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:34,519
cannabis when we speaking of the modern

166
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:37,038
drug like Tylenol that uh all of you

167
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,200
knows that it's composed of three main

168
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,360
ingredients with a very specific uh

169
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,278
dosage but when we are talking of the

170
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,159
Canabis we're talking of more than 500

171
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,720
different bioactive metabolites that is

172
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,919
a nightmare for the for the doctors

173
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,759
because they love to have one molecule

174
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,278
one receptor to study everything but

175
00:08:54,759 --> 00:09:00,559
when you're talking uh that we have more

176
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,838
than 500 molecules they get scared and

177
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,879
they they don't know how to deal with it

178
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,839
and even for the colleagues who are

179
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,720
working on the addiction or other

180
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,120
negative impact of the Cannabis this is

181
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,560
again is complex because compared to

182
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,839
other substances that there are uh

183
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:22,759
mostly one molecules or the specific

184
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,720
molecules with a uniform uh composition

185
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:27,838
in cannabis we are talking each plant

186
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,440
has a different composition so anyone

187
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,279
consuming a different uh uh uh genotypes

188
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,399
or strain they're getting a different

189
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:43,278
effect or different uh uh different uh

190
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:46,839
in terms of the physiological impact so

191
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:49,720
I go back to the biology of high school

192
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:53,839
how the phenotypes is created phenotypes

193
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,399
is the result of the genetics and

194
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,920
interaction with the environment right

195
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,278
so in cannabis we are doing a wonderful

196
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:05,078
job in indoor production we are trying

197
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,958
to fully control the conditions to avoid

198
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:09,479
or minimize the impact of the

199
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,719
environment and for the controlling the

200
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,759
impact of the genetics we are mostly

201
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,360
relying on colonal

202
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:21,278
propagation so as I said for the

203
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,079
environment we have the very nice

204
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:27,480
controlled environment we can control

205
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:29,799
temperature water nutrition heat CO2

206
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,680
everything that you can imagine in a

207
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:37,078
very uh sophisticated way so we are

208
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:40,120
minimizing the uh the impact of

209
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:42,879
environment so for the propagation in

210
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,839
general we have three different ways to

211
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:49,639
produce cannabis first is the uh

212
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,480
producing cutting getting cuttings uh

213
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,120
from the mother plant or producing the

214
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,440
Clones through init through tissue

215
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,839
culture or propagating through

216
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,480
seeds so mother

217
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:07,120
plant in cannabis uh you may know we

218
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:11,639
have the are dacious plants we have male

219
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,560
and female uh plants and we are very

220
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,879
sexist industry because we're only

221
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,239
interested in female because the only

222
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:23,838
plants that they produce the high levels

223
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:28,600
of the cannabinoids and we always try to

224
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:32,360
eliminate the uh the maze that's why we

225
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,040
it take the uh female plants with the

226
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,639
interesting you know traits take them as

227
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,159
a mother plant and try to take the

228
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:44,320
cuting so in my lab we do a great job of

229
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,639
having the uh mother plants taking

230
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,399
cuttings

231
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,079
wonderful uh cuttings of having the nice

232
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,440
rooting and

233
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,039
everything like other industrial

234
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,040
Partners we seeing that after fee

235
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,759
generation the cuttings they're getting

236
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,838
detered and they are changing the

237
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:06,159
uh phenotype and they are not really uh

238
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,320
similar to their original Mod and that

239
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:12,679
was a question that we were asking

240
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:16,720
what's happening here so to study that

241
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:18,638
uh we've tried to uh use the DNA

242
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,600
sequencing technology to see what's

243
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,000
happening within a plant so we had a

244
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:30,159
very nice mother plant 1 a half year

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,600
old uh know taking care of wonderfully

246
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,319
well everything that was uh you know

247
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,839
great to to keep it in a vegetative

248
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,160
stage for that long time and it's been

249
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,680
that great so we have taken the samples

250
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,159
from different part of the plants and we

251
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:50,479
have sequenced the DNA the whole genome

252
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:53,838
so how it works so we extract the DNA we

253
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,199
uh generate the read sequence and try to

254
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,560
align these trees against a reference

255
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:03,919
genome to find if there is a different

256
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:07,198
in terms of the DNA uh within these

257
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:10,479
samples this work has been done with my

258
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:12,838
PhD student Christian I think you may

259
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,720
know him now he's the host in the future

260
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,760
canis show he's doing great job in that

261
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,959
part when first we got the results it

262
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:25,319
was just like crazy it's not it can't be

263
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:27,759
true so we have read it we did redo the

264
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,800
whole analysis we did again sequencing

265
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:35,078
because we found tons of setic mutation

266
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:37,599
within the plant within a single mod

267
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:39,679
plant so that is that was crazy because

268
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,600
if you take the cuttings from different

269
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,278
part of the plants you're going to get

270
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,959
different plants different plants

271
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,720
different products different products

272
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:52,599
different effect so this was saying that

273
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,040
the Clones that is in theory they should

274
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,040
be the similar to each other they are

275
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,278
not really clones they are not uniform

276
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,559
they are not genetically stable and they

277
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:05,838
have a variable metabolic

278
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:08,919
profile so at the same time uh we have

279
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,959
tissue culture lab we had the lots of

280
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:14,719
clones in our tissue culture system uh

281
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:18,879
we've decided to do the same type of

282
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:24,040
analysis for the Clones derived from the

283
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:26,198
tissue culture so we had 78 clones uh

284
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:30,000
from the same genetics right from two

285
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,958
sister lines that they had the same

286
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,159
chronological age but they were in

287
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:36,799
different number of the generations sub

288
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:42,600
culture from six to 11 sub

289
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:45,838
culture and as always and uh as other uh

290
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,759
Industries uh we were using SSR markers

291
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,160
always to confirm our colonal lines and

292
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,800
then we were doing the SSR markers very

293
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:56,958
limited number of the markers 14 that

294
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:59,639
you know usually most of the uh

295
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,078
collaborators also they're using all the

296
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,680
plants they were similar know they were

297
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,838
like clones no differences and this

298
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:09,198
created the question for us maybe this

299
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,519
is a technological problem so we we've

300
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:15,278
taken the same DNA and we did the the

301
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,480
sequencing sequencing by uh genotyping

302
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:21,000
meaning in know sequence around 5% of

303
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,320
the genome and looked over the variation

304
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,440
and it has changed everything so there

305
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,319
was tons of variation within the colonal

306
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,800
lines lots of uh again variation in

307
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:37,278
within these colonal lines another thing

308
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:40,559
that was extremely interesting for us

309
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:43,838
that was the accumulation of the sutic

310
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:47,638
mutation uh over different subculture or

311
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,399
generation from six to 10 or even

312
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,000
generation we've got the increase in in

313
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,078
terms of the number of the somitic

314
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,078
mutation that has

315
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,198
accumulated this means again the Clones

316
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:02,039
they are not uniform they are

317
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:05,399
genetically stable and they have a

318
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:08,838
variable metabolic profile

319
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:13,240
so two first method to produce the

320
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:16,560
Cannabis not very interesting for the uh

321
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,919
medical purposes that we want

322
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:22,159
stability so we said uh we start doing

323
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,599
some work from the seat propagation from

324
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:28,559
the seats uh the first uh OBS that we

325
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,959
had there is no genetic L quor of the

326
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,399
Canabis is because uh mostly we were uh

327
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:37,758
based on

328
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:40,679
the colonal propagation and the lack of

329
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,680
inbr lines at least whatever we have

330
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,799
tested in Canada there is no inbr line

331
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,599
we are interested in female plants and

332
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:51,919
then the question comes do we use the

333
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,920
regular females or feminizes and all

334
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:58,039
these story so feminis is a very

335
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,679
interesting concept that we have in

336
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,519
Canabis again

337
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,519
we have the male and female plants the

338
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:09,078
similar uh chromosomal composition like

339
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:13,838
human we have XX chromosome for the

340
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:17,480
female and XY chromosome for the male

341
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:20,438
but we have a luxur and very interesting

342
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,279
Concept in cannabis that we can use

343
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:26,600
different chemical or environmental

344
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:29,879
impact like here we are talking of the

345
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:34,038
STS silver Ty uh T

346
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,039
sufate that is the ethylin inhibitor so

347
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:40,000
when we are applying the the STS on

348
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,359
female plants it has a masculinization

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,960
effect that means the female plant that

350
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:48,479
it can produce the male flowers then we

351
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,279
can autop pollinate these plants to

352
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,720
produce the seeds that they are

353
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:58,200
100% female or XX

354
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,400
chromosome the same way we can use aapon

355
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:06,038
chemical that can uh revert to the uh

356
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:08,360
Ean to Pro to feminize the male plants

357
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:10,640
and produce the female flows on the male

358
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,240
plants to produce the

359
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,840
masculine that was very interesting but

360
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,079
we wanted to know how itan affects this

361
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:24,199
you know whole process if she stent in

362
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:26,558
the lab uh try to figure out all the

363
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,558
ethylin paway signaling and the

364
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:32,918
bioscientists paway of the e and all the

365
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:36,480
genes located on different part of the

366
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:40,200
genome and how these genes affect

367
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,079
the sexuality in

368
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,960
cannabis so uh as I said we have the

369
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:50,079
plants that they are similar either in

370
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,000
organs like the chromosomal composition

371
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:58,038
or they are similar in terms of the the

372
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,159
floral organ so we have tried to divide

373
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:03,798
the it related genes on three different

374
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:06,120
categories kype concordance that they

375
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:08,918
are you know they are expressed in the

376
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:12,119
same way as the the the chromosomes they

377
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,759
are based on that or they are related to

378
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:17,879
Floral organ component or they are the

379
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:20,919
unique ergs to find out the genes that

380
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,760
they are involved in Sixx plasticity

381
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:25,559
that was really interesting work on the

382
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:26,599
followup Works they are underway for

383
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,720
this

384
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:31,759
study so we're trying to understand the

385
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,679
basis of the femin because it will be

386
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:38,519
the base of our uh breeding program so

387
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,960
now we know we need to have seeds we

388
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:46,279
have to develop a breeding program for

389
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:49,000
the Cannabis so first step to create the

390
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,240
a breeding program uh was to create a

391
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,640
funding ger plasm so we've done a

392
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:58,839
wonderful job trying to look at everywh

393
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:02,000
discussing with mostly every single know

394
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:06,599
in cannabis industry in Canada to create

395
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,839
a representative panel uh of 200 uh

396
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:13,279
Canabis ex uh representative of Canadian

397
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:16,319
legal Market we have phenotype all these

398
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,759
different genetics for more than 20

399
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,918
trades uh even we have created the

400
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,679
different descriptor how to study the

401
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,880
different uh trades or the agronomic

402
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,240
traits or morphological traits in

403
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,799
cannabis we have genotypes sequence all

404
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,880
these lines with the high density GBS

405
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:38,839
having more than 800,000 genetic

406
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:43,000
variants SN single nucle variant and we

407
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:43,000
have chyp them for canabo and

408
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:48,599
tures uh during phenotyping we had some

409
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,200
interesting results because for some of

410
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:54,480
these genetics all of them they were not

411
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,038
coming from the same source so for some

412
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,640
of the genetics we were able to only

413
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:03,240
have quite things for some of them we

414
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,080
had only the femin seeds some regular

415
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,000
seeds and uh so on during phenotyping we

416
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:14,720
found something interesting for example

417
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,960
between uh the plants dve from a regular

418
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,759
female or femin seeds we've uh didn't

419
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,038
saw that much difference in terms of the

420
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,798
phenotypes but for the plants that

421
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,240
driveing from the cuttings or seeds

422
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:31,720
there was a huge difference and we had

423
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:35,240
two different categories of the uh

424
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:38,919
plants either drive from cuttings or

425
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,400
seeds so the Second Step was to uh

426
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:45,038
develop the trade specific markers to be

427
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,320
able to quickly Advance the the the the

428
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,720
breiding

429
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:53,359
program uh so we have done uh a

430
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,558
wonderful job of phenotyping then try to

431
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,918
correlate all these phenotype with

432
00:21:55,558 --> 00:22:01,599
genetic variant to find the genomic re

433
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:05,360
that controlling these different trades

434
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:07,798
we were able to develop uh many markers

435
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,959
that now we are using in our breeding

436
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:13,119
program to advance our lines but one

437
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,159
thing that was interesting during this

438
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,359
analysis of the

439
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:21,720
genetic uh diversity or population

440
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:25,879
genetic analysis within Canadian legal

441
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:28,880
Market we found that we have a very very

442
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,000
very low genetic diversity

443
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,360
everyone's talking that there is lots of

444
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,558
diversity in cannabis there is none in

445
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:41,158
North America soybean is a famous of not

446
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:44,918
having any genetic diversity whole uh

447
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,919
soyan in North America DED from 19 fer

448
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,840
lines the genetic diversity in cannabis

449
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,759
we found is lower than soing this is

450
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:58,158
scary for the future of the Cannabis and

451
00:22:54,759 --> 00:23:00,119
there is no population structure so uh

452
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,679
we assume that everyone was only

453
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,918
interested in THC and forgot whole

454
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,840
concept of the genetic diversity and

455
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,080
other

456
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:13,599
traits then we optimized the selection

457
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:16,359
practices in our lab so we have uh now

458
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:19,480
fully optimized speed breiding program

459
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:21,558
so we can go from seed to seed in around

460
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,798
13 weeks uh that's great so we can

461
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:26,480
advance at least three to four

462
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:29,440
generation per year that increase our

463
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,038
chance of producing new cult work very

464
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,038
quickly also we have optimiz genomic

465
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:39,038
selection process for whom who are not

466
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:43,200
familiar with that uh we have produced a

467
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:46,038
training population that 200 uh ACC that

468
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,240
I've told you with uh phenotype genotype

469
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:50,640
chemotype them very

470
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:56,079
extensively with this data we have

471
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:58,919
created a model uh for the selection

472
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,558
then we do the crosses

473
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,080
from the breeding population as soon as

474
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:07,359
the plants germinates we take a small

475
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:11,240
sample of the DNA V sequence and feed

476
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:14,278
the genotyping data into model to try to

477
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,319
predict the phenotype so we don't

478
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:21,119
wait long to see that and this uh helps

479
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:24,599
us to create a very large breeding

480
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:27,479
population so we produce more than

481
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:29,678
30,000 you know plants per year so we

482
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:36,000
can't phenotype all of them so based on

483
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:38,159
this meod we can do a quick selection

484
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
process in terms of the genomic

485
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:44,600
selection so we had tons of the markers

486
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,839
we've done the single uh traits genomic

487
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:50,038
selection here I'm just showing you the

488
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:53,879
Delta 9C percentage based on the genomic

489
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:56,720
selection different uh traits so we can

490
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,960
uh for example with the random forign

491
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,399
machine learning based tool

492
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:06,360
we can predict with 60% accuracy the you

493
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:09,239
know the the progeny that is great that

494
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:12,839
is wonderful in terms of the

495
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:16,000
validation then we have developed a new

496
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:19,199
AI based algorithms that we are now

497
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,038
doing a multitrade genomic selection

498
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,880
integrating uh trades and also markers

499
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,558
based on that we've done uh uh you know

500
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:32,919
reduce the number of the markers now now

501
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:35,720
with only uh phenotyping thca and six

502
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:36,759
markers we can predict the phenotype

503
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,120
with

504
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:44,278
85% accuracy that is absolutely

505
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:47,000
wonderful for the breeding purposes how

506
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:52,480
well we can predict and select the next

507
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:56,079
proen is so cannabis research is in

508
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,480
infancy cannabis is a plant and we need

509
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:01,439
to stabilize its genetics we need need

510
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,679
to understand the plants before going to

511
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,840
do any preclinical or clinical trials a

512
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,240
uniform and reproducible product is

513
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,558
required for the clinical trius that's a

514
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,558
huge problem currently even now we are

515
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:15,879
seeing in Canada because for the

516
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:18,200
clinical trius are getting samples from

517
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,159
the stores which are not the uniform and

518
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,440
creates all these prodile results that

519
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,520
we are seeing in the literature pure

520
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,960
lines are the future of this industry

521
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,639
genomic selection and the speed breaking

522
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,960
will speed of this process and we still

523
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,038
need to explore the genetic basis of the

524
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,640
different traits and understand how the

525
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,919
bi of the Cannabis

526
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,820
works thank you and I would be happy to

527
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:50,880
take any

528
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:54,879
[Applause]

529
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,880
question yes

530
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,319
uh so uh very interesting work I'm very

531
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,759
curious how there seems to be a bit of a

532
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,720
contradiction that if you're seeing

533
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,038
tissue to tissue variation in cannabis

534
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,798
how can cannabis then not be a diverse

535
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:14,119
um species right um from in our

536
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,359
experience when we sequence clones we

537
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,199
don't see hundreds of thousands of

538
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,879
variance between clones and and it maybe

539
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,159
it's just a selection bias of the of the

540
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,278
stuff that we're of the things that

541
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,880
we're working with there certainly could

542
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:25,679
be cers out there that have a higher um

543
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,320
suoc clonal variation rate that we

544
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,038
haven't surveyed but um I'm just trying

545
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,960
to resolve those two things if if you're

546
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:35,079
seeing hundreds of thousands of variants

547
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,440
between tissues um but then seeing very

548
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:38,960
little genetic diversity amongst the

549
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,038
hundreds of cul of arch surveyed in

550
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,600
Canada those those to me seem to be a

551
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,240
bit at odds can you explain uh that's a

552
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:49,000
very good question and I think there is

553
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,880
two different concepts we are discussing

554
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
here is the variation within the colonal

555
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,278
lines and the somatic mutation that's we

556
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,679
are seeing within the Clones when we are

557
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:03,200
talking of the thousands of the variance

558
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,640
but it's when we compare to ACC it's not

559
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,919
that high but that's a that's very high

560
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,000
within the clonal lines but when we are

561
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,278
uh that's the thing I think the genetic

562
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,278
diversity that we are seeing or that

563
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:20,440
exists I think it's mostly based on the

564
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:23,640
sotic mutation that we are seeing rather

565
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,640
than a real genetic diversity and I

566
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:30,000
think we have a problem of the funer

567
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,679
effect in the in the Cannabis so we

568
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,558
we've lost the genetic diversity and the

569
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,399
existing genetic diversity that exist

570
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:40,879
drive from this type of the variation

571
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:43,038
that we see that's why you know it's

572
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,240
create this why there is a variation but

573
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,359
not genetic diversity but I think that's

574
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,159
the basis of our genetic diversity not a

575
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:55,158
real genetic diversity drive from the

576
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,159
natural lines

577
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,000
any other

578
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:11,828
questions so thank you

579
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:11,828
