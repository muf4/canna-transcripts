joined together forces to launch

34
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,400
the healthcare provider medical cannabis

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,560
and to medicinal genomics

42
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,399
so

43
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,399
i am a public health doctor by training

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
and i have been studying cannabis for

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,478
five years now based out of

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,040
massachusetts and i've conducted six

47
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,879
different research studies now the first

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,600
a couple of research studies this is

49
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,599
data that is presented from studies from

50
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,519
consumers and patients that i've led

51
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,839
over the last couple of years and what

52
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,039
this shows we asked in those studies

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,040
previously

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,880
where do you as a cannabis consumer or

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,280
patient find your information about

56
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,239
medical cannabis and on the slide you

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,799
can see

58
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,959
a majority of

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,280
those consumers and patients actually

60
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,280
access their information from a mobile

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
website or healthcare

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,439
a mobile website or

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
in a mobile application

64
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,680
and way far at the end you can see least

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
likely reported

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,560
are accessing information from their

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
clinician or healthcare provider so from

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
the last couple of years asking cannabis

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
consumers and patients you know you're

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
consuming cannabis for what health

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
condition etc

72
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,639
but they're not accessing their

73
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,799
information from a healthcare provider

74
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,199
pointing to the importance of

75
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
this study that we conducted

76
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,119
so the health care provider medical

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
cannabis study was launched in may of

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,200
last year and i'm here today to present

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
the preliminary findings

80
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,679
there are 354 health care providers that

81
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,239
took the survey

82
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,360
the study actually will end in august of

83
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,959
this year

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,560
and was approved by the university of

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,199
massachusetts

86
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,280
dartmouth institutional review board

87
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,119
again the study is led by the coe

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,640
medicinal genomics and umass dartmouth

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,759
so throughout

90
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,878
the last year we have several

91
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:15,280
co-investigators that have joined the

92
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,359
study that either contributed to the

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,199
design and the development of the study

94
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,200
tools and the instruments

95
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,679
or have really worked to help do

96
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,000
outreach for the study and raise

97
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,599
awareness to get health care providers

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,439
to take the study so thank you to all

99
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,679
the co-investigators some

100
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,878
of who are here presenting also at

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,319
canmed

102
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,399
and again thank you to the study

103
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,318
partners for helping to make this study

104
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,599
possible

105
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,759
so

106
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,439
what this is is an anonymous survey

107
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,120
asking healthcare providers what they

108
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,199
know what they want to know and how they

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,959
want to learn it about cannabis

110
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,878
and what we did over the last year was

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,840
think about some pretty innovative ways

112
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,079
to collect data and why do we do this

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
because we're in the middle of a code we

114
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,680
were and in the middle of a covid

115
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,719
pandemic our healthcare providers are

116
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,040
struggling they themselves have ptsd

117
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,598
and high levels of anxiety

118
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,239
and we're asking them to take a survey

119
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:13,438
and 10 minutes out of their time to

120
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,200
contribute to knowledge um so already

121
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,159
you know we're working with a population

122
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,918
that is um you know stressed and so we

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,720
wanted to work on as a public health

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,120
professional by training i also um think

125
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,520
about ways to not only conduct research

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,160
studies but also how do you drive policy

127
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,120
and education around the data that you

128
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
collect

129
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
and so we've implemented several

130
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,240
different innovative

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,960
data collection methodologies and

132
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,600
outreach for this particular study so

133
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,599
we've had flyers qr codes social media

134
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,919
blasts email blasts to healthcare

135
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
providers and systems

136
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,159
attended a number of community events

137
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,519
i'm based in massachusetts so raising

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,199
awareness at local community and asking

139
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,639
citizens to go talk to their healthcare

140
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
providers about it

141
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,478
and presented this study in several

142
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,960
different ways over the last year to

143
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,719
raise awareness and increase our sample

144
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,399
size

145
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
and one of the things that we've

146
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,839
launched in the last

147
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,478
year is something called the cannabis

148
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,359
citizen scientist which

149
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,399
is a program that we launched to inspire

150
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,600
um citizens and patients themselves to

151
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,599
be outreach data collectors so to speak

152
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,000
and raise awareness about

153
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,680
cannabis and about healthcare and their

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,038
healthcare communities

155
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,959
so of those events that i talked about

156
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,918
in the last year

157
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,359
have generated about 30 or so citizen

158
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,359
scientists

159
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,439
in massachusetts that have been helping

160
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,439
us to raise awareness and get the word

161
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,918
out about medical cannabis about the

162
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,759
center of excellence and about the study

163
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,959
this is our

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,879
one

165
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,879
sort of key citizen scientist who's done

166
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,079
a lot of work in calling hospitals and

167
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,240
health centers

168
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,719
around massachusetts to try and

169
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,918
raise awareness

170
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,000
we also formulated a partnership with a

171
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,799
cannabis transport company

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,319
that works with 90 of the cannabis

173
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
dispensaries and operations in

174
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,479
massachusetts to help us take study

175
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,879
packets out

176
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,199
to different outlets and asking

177
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,800
different cannabis outlets to then reach

178
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,520
out to their local

179
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
hospitals health centers and communities

180
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,439
to raise awareness about the study and

181
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,000
kind of start to drive conversation so

182
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:31,918
this partnership just launched this year

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,120
and they we've given 110 study packets

184
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,680
to them

185
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,519
last month and

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,360
they're in the process of distributing

187
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,279
all of these they're in the middle of it

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,280
and so far have reached almost every

189
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,079
corner of massachusetts getting the word

190
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,079
out

191
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,359
so this is really exciting it's kind of

192
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,879
a new innovative way we thought to

193
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
get the word out and so they've

194
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,199
delivered these study packets and

195
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,639
requested every single cannabis partner

196
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,079
that they have

197
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,680
to

198
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,279
you know share

199
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,199
with their local health care providers

200
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,119
and their local healthcare systems

201
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,160
so by the end of the study in august

202
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
hopefully we'll have some more

203
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,439
information about the you know how it

204
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,800
worked

205
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,079
you know whether or not it did raise

206
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,000
awareness or increase our sample size

207
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,079
and drive conversation in these local

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,560
communities

209
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,038
so diving right in uh from a year's

210
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,478
worth of data that we've collected so

211
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:28,719
far

212
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:31,360
we've had 354 respondents to the survey

213
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,960
to date the um

214
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,919
most common profession that has

215
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,399
responded is actually nurses at 25

216
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,839
go nurses and i'm giving thank you to

217
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,799
there's a lot of nurses that i know here

218
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,198
in the audience that are also

219
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,439
participating and helping so thank you

220
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,199
um you know i think nurses are a very

221
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,120
important uh part of our healthcare

222
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,560
system particularly when dealing with

223
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,519
cannabis patients because they're in day

224
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,439
to day

225
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,719
um we have had the most of our

226
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,160
respondents from california

227
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,639
interestingly

228
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,160
second followed by massachusetts and i

229
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,918
think with our targeted outreach in

230
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,720
massachusetts over the next few months

231
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,719
um

232
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,560
we might raise our numbers there

233
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,919
um the majority of the respondents so

234
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,560
far are women and we have um about 78

235
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,560
percent um whites fall by 10 percent

236
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,199
african american

237
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
in our sample size so far

238
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,079
uh 17

239
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,919
of the healthcare respondents actually

240
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,719
work for the veterans affairs

241
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,120
about 50 percent are below the age of 40

242
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,800
years and over about fifty percent have

243
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,720
an income less of a hundred thousand

244
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,560
dollars

245
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,959
um among the health care providers

246
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,478
themselves thirteen percent report that

247
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,038
they are veterans

248
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,519
and uh sixty-six percent are employed

249
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,519
full time

250
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,799
when we ask them type of of health care

251
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,720
facility um it's mainly the most common

252
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,319
is a private practice followed by a

253
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
government hospital

254
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,640
and about uh it looks like about less

255
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,639
than 40

256
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,799
um of our sample has been a healthcare

257
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,679
provider for six years or less so these

258
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,879
are fairly young providers um new in

259
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,399
their profession um but exciting that we

260
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,600
have such a large amount that's working

261
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,519
at the va

262
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,759
now

263
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
we asked and i i interestingly and i've

264
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,879
always asked this question whether or

265
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,639
not the healthcare provider themselves

266
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,639
actually consumes cannabis and this was

267
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,240
surprising to me 42

268
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,559
of the people healthcare providers in

269
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,799
our samoa reported that they themselves

270
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,879
are cannabis consumers or patients

271
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,519
now that's a really important and

272
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,720
interesting data point to note as we

273
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,959
move forward in some of the data

274
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
presented because this is a population

275
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,958
of cannabis consumers and patients that

276
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,879
find benefit themselves in addition to

277
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,079
being healthcare providers

278
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,559
84

279
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,480
of the sample i've actually um visited a

280
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,000
dispensary which is very good i know a

281
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,159
lot of healthcare providers that haven't

282
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
ever even visited one

283
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,360
and

284
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,200
out of those that report experience with

285
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,399
cannabis they've had a positive most

286
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
have had a positive or extremely

287
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,159
positive experience

288
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,320
so just in some we have majority

289
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:08,958
women um a high population of nurses

290
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,278
um we have a younger population that's

291
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,759
reporting um they're currently cannabis

292
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,480
consumers and you know have visited a

293
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,958
dispensary so pretty knowledgeable uh

294
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,639
respondents

295
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,599
so

296
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,439
we asked also are you licensed to

297
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
actually recommend medical cannabis in

298
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,519
your state 54

299
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,519
said they are licensed and none of those

300
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,519
that were not licensed to recommend

301
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,120
cannabis in their state

302
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,720
about half of them said that they

303
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,919
intended to become licensed in the

304
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,839
future

305
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,559
and when we asked you know what are some

306
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,920
barriers for you to actually accessing

307
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,759
licensure

308
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,439
some of them reported

309
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,720
you know one they didn't want to be

310
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
certified

311
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,480
state body doesn't recognize their

312
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,360
profession to be certified and so i

313
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,440
think that's an important one to note um

314
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,800
state by state barriers for you know

315
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,279
somebody who actually wants to become a

316
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,879
recommender and then there's other

317
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,480
issues such as

318
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,720
you know my healthcare facility or

319
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,480
organization prevents me from becoming a

320
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,560
recommender of cannabis

321
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,959
or don't ask don't tell policy at their

322
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,599
workplace

323
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,039
now when we asked all the healthcare

324
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,399
providers do you believe medical

325
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:23,519
cannabis has a role in medical care and

326
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,958
37 believe it has a role as a first-line

327
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,600
medical treatment

328
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,399
that's pretty yeah i mean that's a

329
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,720
pretty significant data point and then

330
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,958
right following that 30 believe that

331
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,600
there's some role for specific health

332
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,759
conditions and then 13

333
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,079
believe that there's a role if the first

334
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,879
line treatments fail there's a role for

335
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,639
medical cannabis and then 12 percent

336
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,399
said they just needed more scientific

337
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,958
evidence to actually make a decision

338
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,958
about this

339
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,120
out of the sample um you know the we

340
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,719
asked have you received formal education

341
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,440
training 60

342
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,079
had received some formal training and

343
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,200
out of those did they get cme credits

344
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:10,319
about 75 actually got cme credits

345
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,320
and 62 reported that their workplace had

346
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,639
a policy related to medical cannabis

347
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,120
now this is um actually

348
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,680
one of probably my favorite graph as

349
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,679
i've looked at this data quite a bit

350
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,638
but it's interesting because it shows

351
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,559
that

352
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,159
you know the majority of respondents

353
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,239
really believe that medical cannabis is

354
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,838
effective just said that you know about

355
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,560
the first line treatment

356
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,560
the majority also somewhat agree or

357
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,838
agree that medical cannabis can be a

358
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,879
beneficial tool in the opioid epidemic

359
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,839
and

360
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,639
by and large they largely

361
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,560
disagreed that cannabis is a gateway to

362
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,399
other illicit drugs so we're starting to

363
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,278
see potentially at least in this

364
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,679
population that shift away from

365
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,559
the cannabis is a gateway drug

366
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,078
there's still some uncertainty around

367
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,599
you know whether or not

368
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,078
from healthcare providers whether or not

369
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,120
an inhaled cannabis has the same risk as

370
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,719
tobacco or other combustible products

371
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,639
and that was a really interesting

372
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,000
presentation about the vapes earlier and

373
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,799
i think

374
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,320
having more training around vapes and

375
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,679
combustion

376
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,839
for healthcare providers and for

377
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,838
patients is actually really important

378
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,359
these graphs all like the top two

379
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,359
really

380
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120
showing that

381
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,680
again the healthcare providers in these

382
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,959
samples really strongly agree or agree

383
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,879
that medical cannabis is a legitimate

384
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,958
medical therapy

385
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,480
and that they also agree that health

386
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,479
care providers should be offering

387
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,039
medical cannabis to manage

388
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,920
conditions

389
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,319
they you know again somewhat found the

390
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,479
process um to certify

391
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
patients within programs somewhat

392
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,278
difficult to navigate

393
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,040
and then

394
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,720
you know believe that um you know

395
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,278
a little it looks like a little less

396
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
than half uh strongly agree or agree

397
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,639
believe that the process to certify

398
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,559
patients in the program actually

399
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,240
prevents them from enrolling patients so

400
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,119
these are just regular you know

401
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,600
regulatory barriers to access or just

402
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,320
challenges just for even becoming a part

403
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
of the program

404
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,719
majority of the respondents in the

405
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,560
sample

406
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,480
regularly ask their patients about

407
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,319
medical cannabis use and report that

408
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,320
their patients feel comfortable talking

409
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,879
to them about their cannabis use but the

410
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,440
providers are you know

411
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,320
not strongly agreeing that their patient

412
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,199
is very knowledgeable about cannabis

413
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,600
so

414
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,919
these uh this group feels like maybe

415
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,480
more potential patient education

416
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:51,120
is warranted

417
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
we asked the providers how helpful do

418
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,000
they think

419
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,759
cannabinoids are and the treatment of a

420
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,159
variety of conditions

421
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,799
and there was a top few winners among

422
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,159
this is not an exhaustive list of

423
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,799
conditions

424
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,639
but cancer pain by and far providers

425
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,439
thought would be very helpful or

426
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,519
somewhat helpful medical cannabis for

427
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,720
then you can see seizures as well but

428
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,720
less so on glaucoma tourettes and others

429
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,480
chronic and intractable pain providers

430
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,959
thought that

431
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,360
the cannabis would be very helpful or

432
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:28,399
somewhat helpful for

433
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,240
and in addition terminal illness and

434
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,519
post-traumatic stress disorder

435
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
interestingly

436
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,560
post-traumatic stress disorder you know

437
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,559
is a complex

438
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,159
condition

439
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,000
and i have looked in this in the

440
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,399
veterans population specifically in the

441
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,198
past and i think there's a lot of

442
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,360
interesting nuances related to ptsd um

443
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,439
so interested to hear that this uh

444
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
cohort also thought that uh cannabis

445
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,759
could be very helpful or somewhat

446
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,198
helpful for that category

447
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,879
when looking at

448
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,879
these other types of

449
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,399
health conditions

450
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,799
als and parkinson's coming out as

451
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,480
top contenders so to speak

452
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,639
and alzheimer's as well

453
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,879
um but you can see you know

454
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,639
in all of these conditions um that we've

455
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,480
just seen these graphs you know more

456
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
than 50 of the sample believes that

457
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,278
medical cannabis has some role to play

458
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,159
either very helpful or somewhat helpful

459
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,720
so um you know looking at across a

460
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,958
myriad of health conditions a myriad of

461
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,920
symptoms and these providers are seeing

462
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,078
relief in this just underlines the point

463
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,240
of you know the endocannabinoid system

464
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,439
deficiencies and personalized medicine

465
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,360
and really paying attention to the

466
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,959
patient themselves

467
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,879
is important for cannabis medicine

468
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,399
so there's both

469
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,639
mental

470
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,519
health relief and physical symptom

471
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,440
relief

472
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
that you know patients and consumers in

473
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,600
the studies that i've run and others

474
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,278
have run find um you know cannabis is

475
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
helpful for

476
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,720
um so in this sample

477
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,439
not only um you know do clinicians think

478
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,519
it'll help improve physical functioning

479
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,720
and energy level

480
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,639
mood enjoyment of life social engagement

481
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,759
ability to work which i think is a big

482
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,280
one

483
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,078
when you want to you know improve

484
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:21,199
quality of life and return to work and

485
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,198
also the sense of hope

486
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,959
again just in summary you know about

487
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,480
over half of our sample has received

488
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,919
some formal training about medical

489
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,480
cannabis

490
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,038
about half are registered to recommend

491
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,120
medical cannabis by a state

492
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:40,319
37 percent believe medical cannabis can

493
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:42,239
be a first-line treatment um and 70

494
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,678
agree that cannabis can be used strongly

495
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,359
agree or agree that canvas can be used

496
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,080
to address the opioid epidemic

497
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,519
these were the top conditions that

498
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,678
you know

499
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,879
just presented around what came out to

500
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,000
be the most strongly agree or agree

501
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,320
related to the medical value of cannabis

502
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
but again cannabis is not a

503
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,558
one-size-fits-all um it's not for

504
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,720
everybody it's um you know uh and there

505
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,119
are some obviously concerns

506
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,558
that we should be aware of and

507
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,959
um

508
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,798
in this sample specifically

509
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,720
respondents um

510
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,679
were asked what do they think about the

511
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,160
risk of using cannabis does it increase

512
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,200
the risk of possible psychotic symptoms

513
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,720
depression memory problems respiratory

514
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,279
and motor vehicle accidents and by far

515
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,960
psychotic our psychotic symptoms and

516
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,399
motor vehicle accidents are among the

517
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
top concerns

518
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,200
uh among the sample

519
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,319
we also asked you know would this have

520
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,319
any um would cannabis use increase the

521
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,960
possible risk of low birth weight drug

522
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,200
overdose stoke stroke diabetes heart

523
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,558
attack and cancer

524
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,080
and you can see

525
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,079
um those results here as well

526
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,798
i think one of the major

527
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,038
one concerns of regulators of families

528
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,519
of parents also is the potential for

529
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,960
youth to have access or

530
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,759
the potential for recreational misuse um

531
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,279
so

532
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,440
here when we ask these healthcare

533
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,639
providers the um

534
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,798
you know it looks by and large that

535
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,200
potential for recreational misuse of

536
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,720
medical cannabis is is not of a big

537
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,360
concern

538
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,720
nor is the um possibility of diversion

539
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,558
which is quite interesting because when

540
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,640
you hear a lot of

541
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,000
critics you know these are the two two

542
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,840
of the main

543
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,440
areas that people tend to think about

544
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,558
possible risk

545
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,240
but

546
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,119
what is concerning to these healthcare

547
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,798
providers is lack of fda approval and

548
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:49,199
driving under the influence of cannabis

549
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:52,558
which are two very valid um concerns

550
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,038
and also asked about you know sort of

551
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,798
the use other other concerns about using

552
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,919
medical cannabis for those who have a

553
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,599
history of alcohol or drug dependence um

554
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,679
they're less likely concerned of that

555
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,319
but more concerned about their patients

556
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,840
being able to find and afford a

557
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:12,079
a regular medical cannabis supply

558
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,158
providers were also

559
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,000
worried about potential of losing their

560
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,200
medical license or legal repercussions

561
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,919
for becoming

562
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,000
a medical cannabis recommender

563
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,280
stigma related to supporting cannabis as

564
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
a medicine

565
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,798
and then again a youth access

566
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,720
causing health risks

567
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,558
so turning into um you know specific

568
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,159
data points around knowledge around

569
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:37,200
medical cannabis this is going to be a

570
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,600
lot of

571
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,919
data points thrown at you very quickly

572
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,079
and i know i'm also running out of time

573
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,080
so i'll try and do it as much justice as

574
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:49,038
possible

575
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,399
we asked okay what what do you know um

576
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:51,839
how do you want to learn about medical

577
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,159
cannabis in the future and this

578
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,519
healthcare provider sample prefers to

579
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,559
learn um

580
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,639
via lecture and scientific journals and

581
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,678
peer-reviewed publications as their top

582
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,200
ways then followed by news or national

583
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,159
curriculum or

584
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,159
industry training

585
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,639
well we ask their level of confidence

586
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:17,519
and certain key competencies related to

587
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
either knowledge or practice

588
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,440
so

589
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,960
um

590
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,120
the

591
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,880
uh yellow and the orange obviously being

592
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,279
confident and are completely confident

593
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,440
and fairly confident so this population

594
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,038
felt you know pretty confident about

595
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,279
knowing how to evaluate for drug

596
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,279
cannabis interactions

597
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,639
also how to retrieve drug information

598
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,639
for the use of medical cannabis

599
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,360
also

600
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,599
were

601
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,279
by and large more comfortable knowing

602
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,759
how to talk to a patient who uses

603
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,678
cannabis about the medical benefits

604
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:53,919
and knowing how to talk about the dosage

605
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,919
forms that are available for cannabis

606
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:00,879
but less so knowledgeable about

607
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,600
the effects of receptor activation on

608
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,559
neural neural function or the physiology

609
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:08,158
of the endocannabinoid system

610
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,000
and really

611
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,720
less knowledgeable on the pharmacology

612
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,839
and the receptors that they act upon

613
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,079
but more

614
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:19,038
and and less so obviously on mechanisms

615
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:22,359
of of action for different cannabinoids

616
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,359
and phytocannabinoids

617
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,720
here

618
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,320
we asked about um a variety of

619
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,120
physiology um like i said activation on

620
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,639
neurons um you know are they familiar

621
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,279
with the pharmacology of cannabinoids

622
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,720
and the receptors that they act upon

623
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,000
and all of these

624
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,600
felt you know right around the range of

625
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
uh 50 percent being yes i know and and

626
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,798
no really i i somewhat know and need

627
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,798
more information

628
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,759
when asked about

629
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,519
cannabis derived products and how

630
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,839
they're metabolized

631
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,200
issues around labeling and accuracy of

632
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,359
labeling

633
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,558
the stability of active ingredients and

634
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,079
hemp and artisanal products how hemp and

635
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,399
non-fda

636
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,079
cannabis products are produced

637
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,000
you can see all of these are hovering

638
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,519
really around half of this population

639
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,400
feels very confident or very

640
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:23,759
knowledgeable about it and and half not

641
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,000
and less so on the likelihood of um you

642
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,839
know important things like um

643
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,960
transmission of cannabis derived

644
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,558
products through breast milk which

645
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,759
actually a colleague presented recently

646
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,759
on in at canx

647
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,839
when asked about differences between um

648
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,599
you know fda

649
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,199
approved products and products that are

650
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,359
out on the market

651
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,080
less knowledgeable

652
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,519
really less knowledgeable also about

653
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,359
you know understanding the potential

654
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,558
role of terpenes and enhancing these

655
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,839
products

656
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,240
or again the uses of fda purified cbd

657
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,240
products

658
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,640
so some key takeaways um again over half

659
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,480
of our sample we have a very

660
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,240
knowledgeable sample i feel like about

661
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,038
medical cannabis

662
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,599
about key competencies about it half of

663
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,240
the group and the majority of these

664
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,599
data points around knowledge felt

665
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,120
very knowledgeable

666
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,558
or somewhat knowledgeable

667
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,439
but they were less likely to know the

668
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:23,519
mechanisms of action and

669
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,759
really unsure of you know really trying

670
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:29,359
to drill down between fda approved and

671
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,359
non-fda approved products

672
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,120
but to close out we asked whether or not

673
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,839
you know what should be sort of the next

674
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,439
steps around medical education and some

675
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:43,038
of these competencies

676
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,960
and um over 50 and these are over 60 of

677
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,000
our sample they still agree although

678
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,600
they felt like they were very

679
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,679
knowledgeable that they need more

680
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,519
education about medical cannabis more

681
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,600
education about the endocannabinoid

682
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,798
system more information about where to

683
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,199
find

684
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,960
data in the scientific literature

685
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,360
where to get

686
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,480
actual legitimate cme courses so thank

687
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,319
you to

688
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,240
um you know canmed for putting on this

689
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,839
conference we need more like this

690
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,599
um and you know um 60 said that of the

691
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,079
healthcare providers prefer to learn

692
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,480
actually through a cme course online but

693
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,319
they also were interested in learning

694
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,200
about medical cannabis in person through

695
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,200
in-person events

696
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,759
really everybody's interested in

697
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,519
learning cannabis a majority over half

698
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,359
are interested in learning cannabis

699
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,359
medical cannabis and its impacts on a

700
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,439
variety of conditions from cancer

701
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,359
pediatrics ptsd

702
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,440
chronic pain

703
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,359
even now with covid or

704
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,000
seniors 55 plus

705
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,839
so i think there's room for

706
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,319
all different types of specialties all

707
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,918
different types of healthcare providers

708
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,240
you know different health conditions

709
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,799
where this can be studied and continued

710
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,400
to be implemented in the in the future

711
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,319
in different care and treatment

712
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,840
paradigms

713
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,918
and

714
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,439
by and large majority agree that medical

715
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,200
cannabis education should be a part of

716
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,840
the required curriculum in the next five

717
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,159
years um that you know there should be

718
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,839
more education on how to discuss and

719
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,400
counsel the risks and benefits of

720
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:15,038
cannabis use to be included in in

721
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,798
healthcare provider curriculum

722
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,440
education around the pharmacology of

723
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,359
cannabinoids and cannabis use so i think

724
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,720
there's a real opportunity to

725
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,519
you know create

726
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,159
teams of healthcare providers the nurses

727
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,720
physicians pharmacists you know from a

728
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,159
variety of areas to maybe do clinical

729
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,000
case rounds and studies and have

730
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,720
discussions and bring in different areas

731
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,679
of

732
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,159
um you know education for

733
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,038
one within within a curriculum but also

734
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,159
within a healthcare center community

735
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:48,480
and uh 72 percent believe that students

736
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,559
should receive education not only about

737
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,798
medical cannabis but about their state

738
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,480
program laws and about their medical

739
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,319
cannas program which i think is really

740
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,278
critical to know what they can do what

741
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,480
they can't do um so not only you know

742
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,319
what are what are the science and

743
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,960
clinical aspects but what's the state

744
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:07,359
and regulations around it

745
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,480
so i'd like to thank the study partners

746
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,678
i'd like to thank the study

747

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,038
very interesting because i think when

00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,798
you i was saying earlier when you're a

831
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,720
cannabis patient and the pecans patients

832
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,798
that i've interacted with and they find

833
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,278
that it really helps they become some of

834
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,158
the biggest champions and advocates and

835

838
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,480
biggest advocate calling every hospital
