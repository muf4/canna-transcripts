[Music]

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,880
and one of the things that my lab has

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,278
been working on um we do have some uh

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,960
some funding from the USDA as part of a

5
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,559
a larger multi-state project and uh

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,000
we've been looking at uh at what is the

7
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:31,159
called the critical weed-free period in

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,519
hemp and and all crops have this uh sort

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,399
of

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,760
theoretical concept where you know if

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,799
you can control the weeds during so many

12
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,079
weeks initially as the crop gets

13
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,159
established then you can maintain uh you

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,239
know reasonable yields by the end of the

15
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,799
season so there's this critical period

16
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,198
when uh plants are are more sensitive to

17
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,198
competition and you have to to Really

18
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:55,280
take care of the weeds during that

19
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,679
period of time well we were looking at

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
this and uh there were students in my

21
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,439
lab that were weeding hand weeding our

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,359
hemp plots uh at different intervals

23
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,359
throughout the season so some of the

24
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:08,118
plots were not weeded at all you know we

25
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,680
planted the hemp and and walked away

26
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,040
basically and then uh there was a there

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,920
was a treatment that was only weeded for

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,560
a week and then two weeks and three

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,879
weeks and so on and there was one

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,519
treatment that was weeded for the entire

31
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,599
season um so we were all a little

32
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,840
surprised when we did a preliminary

33
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:28,039
analysis of the data and we found that

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,920
statistically there was no difference

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,799
whether or not we we didn't weed the

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,079
plants at all or whether we weeded for

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,320
87 days which was the entire season wow

38
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:40,319
so exactly

39
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,319
that's that's what we thought as well um

40
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,839
we could see a little bit of evidence

41
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,718
for um heavy grass competition so we

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,280
could see that the plots where had where

43
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:52,359
there was a lot of grass uh competing

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,718
around um those were our 14-day weed

45
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:57,239
weed treatments but but we could see a a

46
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:59,078
hit in the overall biomass uh with some

47
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,599
of the competition but it was just

48
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:04,319
amazing that statistically there was no

49
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,679
difference so so we're now in our second

50
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:11,919
year of that study and we'll be um doing

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,120
a more um detailed data analysis and

52
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,079
we'll be looking at all the different

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,959
yield components because that was just a

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,840
rough look at overall biomass of uh

55
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:24,959
fiber and Dual Purpose crops so um so

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,000
yeah it's it seems like um it's one of

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,000
those crops where if it gets a head

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,959
start it's it's fairly competitive

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,519
interesting yeah so timing is everything

60
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,000
yeah it is it is no but so just want to

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,400
make sure I heard that correctly so the

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,840
amount that you weeded whether you did

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,840
none at all or you weeded throughout the

64
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,479
whole thing it did it didn't have an

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,519
effect on the overall yield at the end

66
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,238
it didn't on the overall biomass that

67
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:55,158
was produced not looking at quality of

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,800
fiber or amount of seed yield so just

69
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:59,959
overall plant biomass now there may be

70
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,840
differences for each of those components

71
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,280
right because plants will uh in that's

72
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,360
it's an investment strategy right so um

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,878
they may have been investing in growth

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,640
and inst structure and putting less into

75
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:14,798
seed production for example so uh now

76
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,199
that we have two years of data I I hope

77
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,840
that we're able to sort of tease apart

78
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:23,119
any any of those differences but um and

79
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,959
and now we do have of course we have a a

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,920
pre-emergence herbicide that's labeled

81
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:32,959
as well so if uh if Farmers want to grow

82
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:35,199
hemp now there's there's more um more

83
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,400
tools available uh to give the hemp a

84
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,399
head

85
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:49,580

86
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,598
