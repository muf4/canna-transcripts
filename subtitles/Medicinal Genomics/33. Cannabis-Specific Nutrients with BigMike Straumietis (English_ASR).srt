you got into the industry

157
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,439
because you've been very open in the

158
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,399

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,478
i had a lawn care company where i had to

167
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,160
mix these big tanks full of chemicals

168
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,599
and you sprayed it on the grass and you

169
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,439
made the grass screen and kill all the

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,960
dandelions and weeds and crabgrass and

171

all that stuff

172
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,560

and they would go you know we could make

174
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,600
a hundred thousand dollars in a room

175
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,120
this size okay great

176
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,479
then be another room and they'd show me

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,519
they go well we make half a million

178
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,800
three hundred thousand

179
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,159
i go this sounds illegal they go it is

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,720
like well what is it

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,080
and uh they go you're not ready we don't

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
want to tell you yet so i said

183
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,599
okay fine and one day they invite me

184
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,560
over to their house and they go come

185
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
here for a second i want to show you

186
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,199
something

187
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,560
they take me down in the basement they

188
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,280
open a door

189
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,639
and this is 1983 so there's you know

190
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,279
there's not a lot of information about

191
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,800
growing

192
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,359
there's no it the internet didn't even

193
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,960
exist then and they had a couple of uh

194
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,520
metal halide lights and some

195
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,318
some plants some gangly looking plants

196
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,318
underneath there

197
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,520
they go this is it this is uh we can

198
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,400
make money growing

199
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,918
uh marijuana indoors and uh you know

200
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,638
it's totally safe and

201
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,318
gave me the spiel they go well one thing

202
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,400
is we don't know how to take cuttings

203
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,120
and we read about how you can replicate

204
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,799
a plant we don't know how to do that so

205
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,560
i went to the library looked up some

206
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
stuff found this thing called the

207
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,319
floating

208
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,919
broth method and basically it's where

209
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,120
you use a uh

210
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,758
auxins in a liquid solution and

211
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,959
you make a hole in a piece of styrofoam

212
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,720
and you put the kind of

213
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,879
the some of the cutting through there

214
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,520
and it just kind of floats in the broth

215
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,639
and lo and behold it grew roots they

216
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,879
thought i was a genius

217
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,720
so uh we're off to the races and running

218
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,800
and started growing uh

219
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,240
cannabis indoors and eventually outdoors

220
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
and the biggest

221
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,160
challenge i found was i talked to a few

222
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,680
other growers i go

223
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,120
you know the stuff that we buy from

224
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,240
these companies do you think it's really

225
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,879
for cannabis

226
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,400
and they go we don't know and and we all

227
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
often wondered that as well

228
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,478
i said well we should be making things

229
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,840
specifically for cannabis and they said

230
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,519
well how do you do that i said well i

231
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,878
understand fertilizers and

232
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,799
so i just started playing around with

233
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,400
different things and eventually

234
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
made some formulations that really

235
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,758
worked well before i was able to use

236
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,919
science

237
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,520
uh and uh you know people were just

238
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,560
saying that this stuff works really

239
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,680
really well

240
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,439
and then when i went to canada uh i was

241
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,439
able to work with ubc university they

242
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,639
had an arm called bc research at that

243
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,879
time

244
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,960
and uh bcit bcit was able to had a

245
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,160
license to take in cannabis

246
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,918
and ubc research had the ability to

247
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,360
uh to check for the different

248
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:30,560
micronutrients that the planets were

249
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,599
using we took

250
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,240
multiple strains uh root samples stock

251
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,680
samples

252
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,080
leaf samples bud samples you name it i

253
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,838
took it all and and looked at it and

254
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,038
figured out quite a bit about the plant

255
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,440
very very quickly

256
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,720
and that was about 2003 when that

257
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,440
happened when i was able to start

258
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,959
actually using science and uh i spent a

259
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
lot of time in the ubc

260
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,359
university research library just

261
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,599
studying all the leading cutting edge uh

262
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,600
you know plant articles that were out

263
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,278
there and publications

264
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,839
and i found this group called the plant

265
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,720
growth regulation society of america

266
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,480
lo and behold from 150 to 200 of the top

267
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
scientists plant growth scientists go

268
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
there

269
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,319
every year guys from like texas a m and

270
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,360
max

271
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,278
plant and send genting cargill and even

272
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
monsanto guys were there

273
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,958
and started talking to all of them went

274
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,879
to all the lectures

275
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,879
the seminars for for years and years and

276
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,759
years learned a lot about

277
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,240
what can uh accelerate plant growth and

278
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,319
uh

279
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
you know give you a a bigger plant with

280
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,160
higher yield and

281
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,920
and more thc those are the two things

282
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,439
that we're interested in at the time

283
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,838
because

284
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
the science of cannabis hadn't evolved

285
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,240
and then eventually

286
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,559
i said i want to take this a step

287
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,159
further so i started looking where can i

288
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,559
find a country

289
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,639
or someplace so i can do this you know

290
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,719
in a bigger scale legally

291
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,559
uh at the time in canada they had just

292
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,959
come acro you know with the laws when

293
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:00,159
back when i was doing it and and started

294
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,639
researching in probably about 2000 2001

295
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,240
it was it was becoming federally legal

296
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,319
and we're working with a bunch of

297
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,519
cancer patients and i said well where

298
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,519
can we go to like

299
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,959
an actual lab environment where we have

300
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,759
better controls

301
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,039
and lo and behold a country of bulgaria

302
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,639
said they were willing to issue a

303
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,679
license had to go through six ministries

304
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,958
to get it

305
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:23,278
and we were able to to uh study it

306
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,319
uh you know our walls or concrete walls

307
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,399
were two and a half

308
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
feet thick we had to put cameras in

309
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,440
there uh

310
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,720
they let us have one kilo of material

311
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,600
whether it was flour or

312
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,399
or an extract we were allowed one kilo

313
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,839
and the rest uh

314
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,679
we had to incinerate and they would

315
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
watch us incinerate it and

316
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,799
i was happy with that i just wanted the

317
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,959
research so

318
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,199
that's kind of the back story of how you

319
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,719
know it all began and

320
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,560
now there's a plethora of products

321
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,560
because of their research wow

322
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,239
no that's quite the story so i i'm

323
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,799
interested it was interesting to hear

324
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
that you

325
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,479
actually sort of started with the

326
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,000
nutrient side before you even got into

327
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,399
cannabis because you said you were using

328
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,039
it

329
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,559
i always have been in in the grass

330
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,879
business since i've been uh

331
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,759
19. i had uh it's called turf pros it

332
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,639
was the company

333
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,879
i started when i was 19 years old

334
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,720
excellent and then you mentioned that

335
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,320
the nutrients you were using before you

336
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,600
sort of formulated something that was

337
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,360
specific for cannabis

338
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,879
what was what was that like how far have

339
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,159
nutrients come from it was like

340
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,600
it was like a company i don't know if

341
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,399
she's just sitting because peter's we

342
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,440
were using

343
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,399
we used a bunch of different companies

344
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,480
and they treated it like it was a normal

345
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,360
flowering plant with a lot of phosphorus

346
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,120
well

347
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,278
we knew i knew right away that this

348
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,919
plant does not like phosphorus does not

349
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,799
use

350
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,679
hardly any phosphorus in fact it uses

351
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,039
probably about

352
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,239
75 to 80 percent less amounts of

353
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,559
phosphorus than it does

354
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,480
uh nitrogen and potassium and when i see

355
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,399
fertilizers and any of these people

356
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,079
listening to a grower if you see

357
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,519
a high phosphorus number stay away

358
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:02,719
from that fertilizer because heavy metal

359
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,039
heavy metals are contained a lot of them

360
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,959
in the phosphorus and also in humic

361
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,159
acids you have to be careful

362
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,879
and so you know i saw a lot of cancer

363
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,039
patients were using the the the

364
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,000
cannabis and i said well heavy metals

365
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,599
has got to be

366
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,278
a it's going to be a concern at some

367
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,079
point so we really

368
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,958
went after the reducing the heavy metals

369
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,599
right away

370
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,078
in fact if you smoke a one gram joint of

371
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,839
a

372
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,120
cannabis uh grown with advanced

373
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,600
nutrients

374
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,759
in regards to heavy metal toxicity it's

375
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,800
no more than 50 drops of drinking water

376
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:39,360
oh yeah that's

377
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,199
that's pretty pretty solid pretty solid

378
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,159
so you mentioned phosphorus so

379
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,079
i mean let's so let's talk nutrients um

380
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,799
so the primary nutrients are nitrogen

381
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,958
phosphorus

382
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,039
and potassium correct right and then you

383
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,958
got your your micronutrients yeah

384
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,078
so how does the plant use these

385
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,759
nutrients and

386
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,319
you know throughout its life yeah sure

387
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:01,360
sure so cannabis

388
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:06,480
actually uses more nitrogen

389
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:10,240
and potassium during the flowering stage

390
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,440
it also uses more

391
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,440
that's right manganese and iron

392
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,240
during the during the flowering stage

393
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,519
and less zinc during the veg stage

394
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,879
actually uses more zinc during the

395
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,159
flowering stage

396
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:30,799
and uses a smidge more

397
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:33,919
boron in in the vegetative state as well

398
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,919
so there's there is a shift in the plant

399
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,799
and how it uses micronutrients and also

400
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,679
how it uses

401
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,240
uh the macros in in secondaries and i

402
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,719
always

403
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,440
say that it canvas uses a lot of iron

404
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,240
actually

405
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,760
and i always sometimes liken it to the a

406
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,320
secondary nutrient like

407
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,720
calcium or magnesium but it's it's not

408
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,079
quite up there but it does use a lot

409
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,839
and by the way that's important if

410
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,559
you're growing in cocoa

411
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,279
oh yeah why so because it will bind to

412
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,879
cocoa

413
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,559
just like calcium magnesium well so you

414
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,559
have to you have to pump up

415
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,679
the calcium magnesium and the iron so

416
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,239
when you see these mixes that

417
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,039
are calmag if they don't have iron in

418
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,519
them

419
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,958
get one that has iron in it interesting

420
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,759
yeah so you mentioned that you know

421
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,078
different

422
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,838
mediums require different nutrients so

423
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,599
you mentioned cocoa

424
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
you know what about the others soil peat

425
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,120
moss things like that what are

426
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,078
different considerations there yeah uh

427
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
soil of course

428
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,319
you know

429
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,479
the ph of soils can can vary in a field

430
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,440
and so can

431
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,560
the nutrients and the type of of of you

432
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,560
know soil

433
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,159
soil is a bit gets more complicated you

434
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,479
gotta look at your water source uh

435
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,719
as well as your soil source and and then

436
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,199
make a mathematical uh

437
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,920
equation out of that so uh pete

438
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,000
pete's easy to use we have two new

439
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,759
products coming out with rogue soil

440
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,039
uh by the way a big announcement and

441
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,720
we'll talk about that later on

442
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:01,120
uh coming out uh and

443
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,160
none of them have a fertilizer charge to

444
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
it so it's uh

445
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,319
sixty percent uh peat moss and forty

446
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,519
percent perlite and the other one's

447
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,920
sixty percent cocoa and forty percent uh

448
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,078
uh pearlite one uh called coco cowboy

449
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:17,439
and pistol pete

450
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:20,479
and pistol's p-i-s-t-i-l oh

451
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,519
right of course i like that

452
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,560
so i mean you mentioned that soil has a

453
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,480
lot of

454
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,479
things you need to consider whether it's

455
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,480
ph and things like that so

456
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,079
for a homegrower a hobbyist grower what

457
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,440
do you kind of suggest

458
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:38,399
in terms of using a uh

459
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,800
yeah look if you're gonna grow and

460
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,879
here's the thing cannabis

461
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,240
is an acid-loving plant and what that

462
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,600
means is you want to keep the

463
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,639
rhizosphere

464
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,399
in in a negative ph or below seven

465
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,839
uh ideally you want to keep it between

466
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,278
five point five point six to six point

467
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,120
you you want that page so the

468
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,159
fertilizers that we

469
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,959
provide the growers are high in cat ions

470
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,278
now why cations are not anions because

471
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,719
you actually take the root system of the

472
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,838
plant

473
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,959
and you turn it into

474
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,839
a ph lowering actually it

475
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,879
helps you lower the ph the roots exude

476
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,839
uh

477
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,278
a substance that drops the ph in the

478
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,240
rhizosphere

479
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,360
and so we our fertilizer actually helps

480
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,600
the plant

481
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
do what it likes rather than there's a

482
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
lot of fertilizers

483
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,000
out there that are high in anions and

484
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,958
that produces an

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,320
alkaline rhizosphere you don't want that

486
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,719
you want to have

487
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,320
a uh an acid rhizosphere

488
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
right so are you saying that your

489
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,639
nutrients kind of help the plant

490
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
yeah and it does help the plant helps

491
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,039
the plant do what what it what it likes

492
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,440
the most

493
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,480
absolutely we we use the plant to get

494
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,000
better yields

495
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,079
because we give it what it was looking

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
for excellent

497
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,120
excellent and so i'm going to come back

498
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
to this home

499
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,799
advice for home growers because i've

500
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,519
tried it myself

501
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,318
with varying degrees of success but i

502
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,160
know that

503
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,159
um advanced nutrients has put together a

504
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
lot of resources to help novice home

505
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,319
growers

506
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,759
um i wonder if you could speak a bit to

507
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,038
that and then maybe

508
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,038
talk about some of the most common

509
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,078
mistakes that homer growers make

510
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:22,400
oh yeah there's a bunch uh okay

511
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,198
so we have a grower support one of the

512
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,839
things with

513
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,519
our product you can call up and you can

514
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,480
actually talk about cannabis so we're

515
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,720
going to talk to you in fact

516
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,160
we've always talked about cannabis so we

517
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
have a great grower support

518
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,519
is open 24 hours a day now and

519
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,880
uh probably the easiest substance to

520
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,519
grow in is uh

521
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,400
is peat moss and pearlite that's uh the

522
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,720
most for giving

523
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,919
i i would say it has some good ph

524
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,440
buffering and they're not as much as

525
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,640
good you know the soil has but

526
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,080
it has adequate ph buffering and

527
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,480
we also when we build our products

528
00:17:54,079 --> 00:18:01,279
we use a lot of chelates we use edta

529
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,599
eddha dpta and glycinates

530
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,119
why because it has it we have a we save

531
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,119
growers from themselves because if they

532
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,239
screw up on the ph

533
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:13,279
i don't want to see them lose a crop so

534
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,359
theoretically our absorption

535
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,599
of our micronutrients which are really

536
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,918
critical is from a ph of one

537
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,719
to ten well we know that the plant's

538
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,759
gonna start dying off at ph 2.5

539
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,640
and 9.5 on the other end of the spectrum

540
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:32,400
so we uh design it to even if you go out

541
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,320
of the ph the sweet spot of 5.6 to 6.3

542
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,840
you're still gonna pull off a crop and

543
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,678
be successful

544
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,119
so we try to save the growers from the

545
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,519
mistakes that they make biggest

546
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,319
mistakes the growers make number one

547
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,759
genetics

548
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:48,079
that's that's most important environment

549
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,319
is number two and they make a lot of

550
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,918
mistakes in the growing environment

551
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,079
the the best temperature that you can

552
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,720
have would be 76 degrees at 40

553
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,000
humidity across the board some strings

554
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,839
obviously are different

555
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,119
but for the most part that'll give me

556
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,480
what you're looking for

557
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,918
also you want to watch vapor you know

558
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,480
bpd

559
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,759
vapor pressure deficit and there's a

560
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,720
cheap down and dirty way of doing it

561
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,079
just make sure your nighttime

562
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,079
temperatures are about 10 degrees lower

563
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,558
than your daytime temperature

564
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,519
interesting yeah i'm writing buttons now

565
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:18,879
that kind of you know

566
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,720
tell you when these tomatoes are open

567
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,320
and when they're closed all right i'm

568
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,600
writing all this down for the next time

569
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,119
i i try to do my

570
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,558
indoor grow um and what about you know

571
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,319
over what about over feeding i mean

572
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,399
you're in the nutrient business but do

573
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,439
do you ever find that home growers are

574
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,840
just

575
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,120
using way too much product yeah yeah you

576
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,599
can and you can tell

577
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,399
when the when the plant is a really

578
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,038
super

579
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,000
rich rich rich dark green almost

580
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,200
iridescent

581
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,599
kind of dark green and that's like

582
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,640
that's at the maximum place you want it

583
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,798
and then of course you're going to see

584
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,919
you know a little bit of the tip burning

585
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:55,200
and when you see that tip burning you

586
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,759
know back off of

587
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,640
the the nutrients and a good rule of

588
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,720
thumb is

589
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,400
about a thousand to 1400 parts per

590
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,919
million in the flowering stage

591
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,919
some you know there's just a lot of

592
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,559
myths uh out there what are

593
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,120
the myths that are you want to match

594
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,440
your

595
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,239
co2 levels to the ppm that you're

596
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
feeding

597
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,679
this is uh absolutely just nonsense uh

598
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,519
a 500 parts per million is the most the

599
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,480
plant can absorb we've tried

600
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,679
2 000 3000 by the way a little trick if

601
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
you want to kill off all the bugs and

602
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,280
insects

603
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,640
10 000 parts per million of uh co2 will

604
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,960
do it

605
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,840
nasa that's what electrics nasal does

606
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,798
for bug control

607
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:40,319
really um and we did touch on it so

608
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:42,240
um growing in soil what about growing

609
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,000
indoor versus growing outdoor are there

610
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,759
different considerations there in terms

611
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,759
of nutrients too

612
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,839
well growing mediums are the you know

613
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,599
the plants the plant you you

614
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:55,678
there is uh uh if you're in soil

615
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,839
it's going to be you know it's going to

616
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,960
be a different

617
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,558
amount of fertilizer that you're going

618
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,279
to put on versus what you're going to

619
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,200
put on

620
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,798
depending on the strain when you're

621
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,798
growing indoors

622
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,480
i can tell you the future of genetics

623
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,798
you will be able to grow

624
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,480
outdoor plants that will look like

625
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,038
indoor plants the reason indoor plants

626
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,360
actually look

627
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,720
the way they do is because they're not

628
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,599
getting exactly what they're looking

629
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,200
what what they really want yeah i think

630
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,558
another big thing with outdoor and

631
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,480
you tell me if i'm on the right track

632
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,119
here will be um autoflower

633
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,880
or huge rooter list absolutely yeah

634
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,000
we've mapped out uh you know some router

635
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,120
airless plants we know where the

636
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,359
mechanism is

637
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:36,239
uh in the future genetics that's what

638
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,678
you're going to see you're going to see

639
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,200
a lot of autoflower in fact you're

640
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,400
starting to see more and more autoflower

641
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,519
but

642
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,840
what because we understand where the

643
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,599
mechanism is you can take that mechanism

644
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,199
and you can stick it into

645
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,038
any strain that you want and it'll

646
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,600
become an autoflower and that's going to

647
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,839
be a big deal in the future

648
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,678
you can get multiple harvests in in a

649
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,480
single growing season

650
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,440
absolutely so let's go back to research

651
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,159
because that was

652
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,919
that was a big part of um what what made

653
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,200
advanced nutrients what it is today i

654
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,679
was wondering if you could speak a bit

655
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,480
more to um sort of the advancements that

656
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,559
you've made

657
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,519
at advancements so a lot of things that

658
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,000
we found out

659
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,400
because i was a member of the plant

660
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,720
growth regulation society of america

661
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,840
there's a lot of so-called tricks that

662
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,798
you can do

663
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,279
uh with with hormones uh to really get a

664
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,038
bigger

665
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,960
you know fat or robust plan if you can

666
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,798
think of uh taking uh

667
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,720
if you think of the incredible hulk

668
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,960
right you can uh

669
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,558
not though not the hulk that was as big

670
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
as a skyscraper but you know the one

671
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,759
with

672
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,880
bill bixby i think it was uh you know it

673
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,440
was lou ferrigno

674
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,120
and and really get thicker stocks and

675
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,159
and put on more weight

676
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,038
now we did a lot of that research and a

677
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,400
lot of that

678
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,400
you know would have to be put through

679
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,320
the epa so right now

680
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,159
we have products for hemp that we're

681
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:57,519
putting through the epa

682
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,360
that uh are have hormones in it and

683
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,720
there's a multitude of things that we

684
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,719
understand about that plant when it

685
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,960
comes to hormones and

686
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
optimizing different characteristics

687
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,360
that you'll be seeing over the next few

688
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,919
years

689
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,519
coming us coming out with first for hemp

690
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,038
because it's readily legal

691
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,639
you're not going to be able to get an

692
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,919
epa registration on

693
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,520
um let's say the thc side yet that's

694
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,919
coming three four years away and

695
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,279
we're ready for it excellent and i know

696
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,120
you've already launched um

697
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,720
advanced hemp a line that's targeted at

698
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,359
um and i believe the product you have

699
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,798
out now is you know is to help with

700
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,759
cbd production so i wonder if you could

701
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,359
explain a bit

702
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:41,599
how how that does that sure well that's

703
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,879
that it's everything there's not just

704
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,199
like one particular

705
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,480
thing it's the way that we build the

706
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,679
product

707
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,000
i i say our product is a belt best built

708
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,200
fertilizer product in the marketplace

709
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,759
because of

710
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,960
the extents that we go to to bring in

711
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,158
the raw materials

712
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,000
that are ultra pure well i'm gonna

713
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,840
i'm just gonna talk about it i'll make

714
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,720
i'm gonna make an exclusive for you

715
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,038
right here

716
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,558
all right and and that is uh hypha

717
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,400
chemicals has been one of ours our

718
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,480
secrets for 18

719
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,798
years we've been having a relationship

720
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,278
we now have taken a step further

721
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,960
and uh we have a very strict we're in a

722
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,919
strategic partnership

723
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,038
with haifa chemicals with rogue soil we

724
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,320
have a partnership

725
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:29,440
uh for soil and uh we also

726
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,558
just acquired tesoro seeds out of the

727
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,240
hemp industry

728
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,079
they were one of the the bigger players

729
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,960
along with hgh

730
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,158
and uh they have some very cool tech i

731
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,360
will be coming out with a plant with

732
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,720
zero thc

733
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:45,038
and uh a high amount of uh cbd

734
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,120
and that will have that in our hands

735
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,720
it's a gene edited plant

736
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,879
uh we'll have it supposed to have in our

737
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,679
hands this november so i'm excited about

738
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,278
that

739
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,798
and there's some other things coming uh

740
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:58,480
down the pike as well

741
00:24:54,798 --> 00:25:01,839
uh you know very low thc to no thc

742
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,400
producing high amounts of th cv as well

743
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,038
we're working on as as as we're speaking

744
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,000
so

745
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,558
i'm excited about about that as well

746
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,079
well that's

747
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,678
that is exciting so you're getting into

748
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,158
the seed game we we

749
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,798
definitely are you know like for and the

750
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
future

751
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,400
for advanced nutrients is matching

752
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,759
strains

753
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,400
with specific protocols for fertilizer

754
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,079
and producing an sop and going to

755
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,278
whoever it is that wants to

756
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,720
say here's this here's the strain

757
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,400
how do you want your genetics do you

758
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,079
want tissue cultures do you want you

759
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,278
know clones do you want seeds you want

760
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,519
feminized seeds

761
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,400
what do you want here's the genetics

762
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,720
here's how you

763
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,000
here's how you take care of that plant

764
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,880
whether it's indoors or it's light

765
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,960
deprivation

766
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,400
or whether it's in soil here's what you

767
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,319
have to do

768
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,919
excellent and so and i think you said

769
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,519
that you're partnering with a soil

770
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,320
company as well so you'll be able to

771
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,798
grow soil

772
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,158
absolutely provide the medium as well

773
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,038
that's it so now we're

774
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,000
vertically integrated at the front of

775
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,798
the value chain

776
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,440
and that's what my goal was and uh we

777
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:05,759
now have

778
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,880
achieved that and there will be some

779
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:07,679
more announcements coming out in the

780
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
future

781
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,200
with some other companies that we're

782
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,600
working with uh out of the

783
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,120
ag space when it comes to genetics we

784
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,278
have some exclusive uh

785
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,119
arrangements coming soon and we're

786
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,880
excited about those as well

787
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,158
and that well and then with those uh

788
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,320
acquisitions it just rounds out

789
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,760
our portfolio very nicely at the front

790
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,399
of the value chain

791
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,519
excellent and as i understand so you're

792
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,720
focusing on hemp

793
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:37,440
now probably for obvious obvious obvious

794
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,240
to me it's cannabis it's like always so

795
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,919
like we

796
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,159
we have tricks of the trade you can say

797
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,880
that we will be putting through the epa

798
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,520
uh if you want to do fiber production

799
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,960
right

800
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,599
one of one of the things i'm excited

801
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,000
about that we were now looking into

802
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,359
is a hemp for protein production uh

803
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,839
never looked at that before

804
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,519
and something that we're really looking

805
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,480
at because we realized that

806
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,679
it is a very very good uh a protein

807
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,919
source and uh

808
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,519
you know better than wheat and you know

809
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,000
doesn't have the gluten problem that

810
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,158
wheat has yeah no it's interesting you

811
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,159
say fiber because i bring it up a lot on

812
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,840
on the podcast because i feel like you

813
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,840
know so much of the the hemp

814
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,000
industry is so focused on cbd right now

815
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,918
but yeah and cbg too as well

816
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,278
yeah but the potential for fiber i think

817
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,120
is just huge

818
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:24,880
it's much bigger and no one's really

819
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,239
tapped into that yet yeah yeah

820
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,000
we're looking we have a product we're

821
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,919
going to be putting through the epa that

822
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,359
i will make i mean canvas is a fast

823
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,840
growing plan already but it's going to

824
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,000
grow like

825
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,199
jack and the beanstalk and and we'll

826
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,480
really get that plant

827
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,519
taller better and uh

828
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,679
at a much quicker rate excellent

829
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,798
so i mean we talked about how you're

830
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,519
focusing on humble

831
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,480
probably because of the legality so

832
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,480
legal

833
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,960
yeah so i wanted to kind of maybe come

834
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,200
back to the whole legality part

835
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,120
you know when you got started obviously

836
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,759
cannabis very much in the black market

837
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,000
and now we're

838
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,839
sort of in the gray market with you know

839
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,519
now there's legislation being proposed

840
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,319
to make it federally legal

841
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,359
um what's that been like seeing it

842
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,240
happen like that

843
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,278
i'm happy for it i mean it's i can

844
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,599
remember my brother and i

845
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,398
17 years ago we're trimming weed and

846
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,398
basement

847
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:20,158
i looked at him i go one day

848
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,079
this is going to be legal he goes you

849
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,399
think so i go yeah in about probably

850
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,398
about

851
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,959
20 20 years or so it's it's going to be

852
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,599
illegal well that was 17 years ago and i

853
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,000
remember he'd

854
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,719
remind me of the conversation and my

855
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,839
brother's like yeah

856
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,159
yeah in the meantime we just keep

857
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,720
tripping right and uh

858
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,320
sure enough i just i just i just knew it

859
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,399
was only a matter of time

860
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,480
that it was going to be legal especially

861
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,158
when i saw prop 215 coming through

862
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
coming through california and it

863
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,159
becoming federally

864
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,359
medical marijuana was federally legal in

865
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,278
canada i said

866
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,199
the the door has been kicked open and

867
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,119
it's just timing now

868
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,840
and uh people used to always ask you

869
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:57,199
what do you think it's going to get

870
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,398
federal legal in the u.s my answer was

871
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,440
when we got 30 to 35

872
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:04,398
states we're there now and uh

873
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,278
you know it's it's unfortunately joe

874
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,319
biden

875
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,038
you know he first said that uh you know

876
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,798
he was

877
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,919
against it and they go joe you can't say

878
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:12,480
it you're not going to get [ __ ] goes

879
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,880
okay

880
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,480
i'm for cannabis and now he's

881
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,960
backpedaling and saying that he's

882
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,919
he's not for cannabis my guess is he's

883
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,240
going to use it for

884
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,000
probably the 2024 election and you'll

885
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,200
probably see it federally legalized in

886
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,880
2025.

887
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,480
now look there's bills being pushed

888
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,320
through all the time from different from

889
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,399
the democrats republicans

890
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,158
and basically they're fighting over

891
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,678
who's going to be the first to and

892
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,520
can claim that they've legalized it

893
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,120
federally and that's what's going on

894
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,079
right now and i wish i would just stop

895
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,759
and just you know

896
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,439
let's just get down to business and we

897
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,480
know it's going to be federally legal at

898
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,159
some point

899
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,079
especially because the economy i mean

900
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,159
right now they're printing trillions of

901
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,359
dollars it's inflationary as as we're

902
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,440
seeing and we're

903
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,119
we're going to go to a probably we're

904
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,640
going to own a huge economic downturn

905
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,918
up to likes that will probably not none

906
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,520
of us have seen and they're going to

907
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,640
need the tax revenue they've already

908
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,599
proposed a 5

909
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,960
uh you know federal attacks on cannabis

910
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,639
i wish they would just go ahead and do

911
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,519
that and let's just get on with it

912
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,320
yeah no i i would agree with you there

913
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,359
and um i

914
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,960
would imagine you guys are well

915
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,519
positioned for it for that day when that

916
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,159
happens

917
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,440
we are indeed we are indeed i mean i put

918
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,640
some things through hemp that can be

919
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,480
used you know can be

920
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,080
will be immediately able to be switched

921
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,640
over to the uh

922
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,798
to the uh the thc site because cannabis

923
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,759
is cannabis and uh you know

924
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,158
that's the way i look at it absolutely

925
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,398
so

926
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,000
i want to talk about canmed because oh

927
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,959
man that's one of the most

928
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,679
the single most probably important for

929
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,919
for my

930
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,278
from from my aspect from the way i see

931
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,720
it the single

932
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,278
most important conference that canvas

933
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,759
has

934
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,278
globally i mean mj business is great you

935
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:50,640
get to see all the stuff that you can

936
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,200
use and the trimmers

937
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,799
but i've always been science driven

938
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
advanced nutrients has always been

939
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,918
science driven

940
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,480
the genetics is science driven uh

941
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,440
sciences is is everything when it comes

942
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,839
to

943
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,038
growing any kind of a plant and the fact

944
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,278
that this is

945
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,798
you know just all about cannabis it's

946
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,720
amazing i was there for the first time

947
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,440
you guys had it in harvard

948
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,399
it was a big supporter then as i am now

949
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,159
and uh

950
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,158
if you're in the cannabis space as

951
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,360
important as mj biz is to you

952

00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,959
um in helping us build out the

957
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,440
cultivation focus area i think it's

958
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,759
going to be

959
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,038
um it's going to be a real standout at

960
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:38,720
this year's event so we're really

961
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,119
excited about that it is in fact that we

962
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,558
you're

963
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,239
really putting an emphasis on

964
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,079
cultivation this year that's going to

965
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,278
get a lot of the growers in there the

966
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,278
master growers

967
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,798

some displays up there that explain

971
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,960
things and help things to uh doesn't

972
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,399
matter what level you're at whether

973
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,759
you're the home hobbyist or you're the

974
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,439
master grower for

975
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:05,038
some you know mso you will learn

976
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,840
something new absolutely so winding down

977
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,158
here i did i

978
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,158
also want to ask you about your um your

979
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,200
humanitarian efforts uh through

980
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,720
humanity heroes um yeah you get to

981
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,038
because it's great work you're doing

982
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,960
good luck i i we believe

983
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,798
at advanced nutrients if a company is

984
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,440
successful they should give back

985
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:22,879
directly

986
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,798
to the community in which they give them

987
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,679
their money and society as a whole so we

988
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:27,839
do both

989
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,600
uh recently where the island of st

990
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,759
vincent was highly impacted

991
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,519
by this volcano that erupted and killed

992
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,038
all the outdoor cannabis plants so we

993
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,399
went we donated a hundred thousand

994
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,558
dollars worth of nutrients

995
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,678
to the growers of of saint vincent we

996
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:41,678
also brought down

997
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,679
our support people so they could learn

998
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,320
different techniques and grow better

999
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,200
better crops uh as well uh with the

1000
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,398
wildfires

1001
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,278
were raging last year we gave away 250

1002
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,518
thousand dollars in

1003
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,159
of advanced nutrients and 250 000 in

1004
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,120

it was a hundred thousand in in cash to

1006
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,918
to to growers that

1007
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,839
to help them out that's how we you know

1008
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,720
help direct go get back directly to our

1009
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,038
community
