um i really wanna i wanna talk about um

154
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
what i mean by that but first i kinda

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,399
wanna take a step back

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,319
and talk about how you got here because

157
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,918
i know you began your career

158
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,439
as a practicing md so how do you kind of

159
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,079
go from being a practicing

160
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,120
md to where you are today like i said

161
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,038
kind of

162
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,360
reworking the clinical research model

163
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,879
it's a it's a little bit of a story for

164
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,080
sure ben

165
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,959
i am a physician by training i did

166
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,279
my medical school program at the

167
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,560
university of kentucky and my residency

168
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,079
at ucla

169
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,439
i i practiced a few years and i think i

170
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,000
honestly knew in my heart

171
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,199
that i ultimately didn't want to

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,478
practice

173
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
and it was a bit of soul-searching to

174
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,800
figure out

175
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,600
how to apply medicine which i happen to

176
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,478
love

177
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
into something that that fit me better

178
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,399
as a

179
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,918
as a human overall and i i sort of

180
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:42,159
jokingly refer to myself now

181
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:45,839
as a as an md gone rogue um

182

00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,879

185
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:55,839
um it it suits me well i

186
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,439
i left practice i did some consulting in

187
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,159
the entertainment industry

188
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,800
and you know my experience over the last

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,439
20

190
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,720
20 plus years or so has has really been

191
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:09,598
a blend of clinical medicine

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,039
marketing strategy education and

193
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,800
speaking

194
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,240
across a variety of healthcare

195
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,439
industries i

196
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,319
i started out in pharma and

197
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,279
did a lot of work there in the copd

198
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,240
space

199
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,239
and ultimately transitioned into medical

200
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,199
education

201
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,360
healthcare advertising and you know for

202
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,800
me that was a great opportunity to learn

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,598
more about how to deliver information

204
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
and really understand what clinicians

205
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,120
were searching for

206
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,079
in order to better understand something

207
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,840
to better take care of their patients

208
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,439
i i moved on from there because

209
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,119
i thought it was really important to

210
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,439
explore digital

211
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,000
and i worked for a digital health

212
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:59,680
marketing and publishing

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,120
company and that really introduced me to

214
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,560
the world of

215
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,519
wellness as opposed to illness and

216
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,800
after after spending some time there

217
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,878
that was sort of

218
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,000
an eye-opening experience for me that

219
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,000
it really inspired me and filled me with

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,240
passion to to do things

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
there that were focused on integrative

222
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,439
practices

223
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,840
and wellness and ultimately

224
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,639
when i left there i i took a little time

225
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,758
to myself

226
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,120
and i played around a bit with a digital

227
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,839
fitness and wellness platform and

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,560
ultimately stumbled across the cannabis

229
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,159
industry

230
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,319
and i say stumbled because it was

231
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,000
actually a really serendipitous

232
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,600
experience i was

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,559
i was at a cocktail party

234
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,159
and chatting with some folks and this

235
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,919
this one woman in particular

236
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,399
was asking me a lot of questions about

237
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,799
my background and the work i'd done as a

238
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,600
liaison and an educator and a speaker

239
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,199
and

240
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,879
i i couldn't quite figure out why she

241
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,759
was asking me all these questions

242
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,600
because to my knowledge there wasn't

243
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,000
particularly anyone coming to this event

244
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,480
that

245
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,440
was involved in that space and you know

246
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,680
long story short

247
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,760
at the at the end of it she's she

248
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,679
suggested to me that i meet her husband

249
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,759
because she said that i needed to work

250
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,079
for him

251
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,799
that's uh that's how i ultimately got

252
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,160
involved

253
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,639
at columbia care first as a consultant

254
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,759
and then moved on to become their vp of

255
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,639
scientific research and communications

256
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,319
and currently i still consult for them

257
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,399
as well but

258
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
that experience really really shaped a

259
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,080
lot of things for me

260
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
and you talked about turning research up

261
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,240
up on its head and

262
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,120
you know working with with columbia care

263
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,399
and their chief

264
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,200
scientific officer dr rosemary massenay

265
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
one of the things i learned is how hard

266
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
it

267
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,000
is to actually accomplish research

268
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:04,159
in the cannabis space i i see you

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,360
nodding your head and i'm sure you

270
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,319
you understand and have heard many many

271
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,440
times that

272
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,640
there's so much bureaucracy politics is

273
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,200
involved of course

274
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,639
and and a lot of the rules are quite

275
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,320
archaic

276
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:23,360
and that's so contradictory to what's

277
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,200
actually happening in the real world you

278
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,000
know we know that

279
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
we know that consumers are are taking in

280
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,799
natural products

281
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,800
at increasing rates and

282
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,000
the shocking part is they're doing this

283
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,759
without any

284
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,879
real solid evidence in a lot of cases

285
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,679
so i i got it i got more and more

286
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,919
interested in

287
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,120
trying to understand why that was

288
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,958
happening

289
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
most of the questions and my speaking

290
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,278
engagements from

291
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
from folks in the audience and also from

292
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,240
healthcare practitioners

293
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,560
because let's be honest they were never

294
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,560
trained on the endocannabinoid system

295
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,759
for the most part a lot of those

296
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,759
questions were

297
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,439
what is it how does it work how do i

298
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:09,039
know how much to take

299
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,720
whether it be medical cannabis or a cbd

300
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,439
containing product

301
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,920
so that was a really great opportunity

302
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,839
for me

303
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:20,159
to explore that that area

304
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,839
and over the course of the time i got to

305
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,879
work in a couple of other

306
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,839
fabulous platforms and consult for them

307
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,958
to help

308
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,200
communities understand natural medicines

309
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,039
and things of that nature

310
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,519
and then and then i think serendipity

311
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:39,759
happened again

312
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,078
i was looking at a website

313
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,039
for the holistic research and education

314
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,000
foundation

315
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,799
which our co-founder palin thoroughgood

316
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
started

317
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,359
and i saw a photo of a friend of mine

318
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,560
that i did residency with

319
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,800
and she's a pediatric endocrinologist

320
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,958
so i i did a little screenshot of her

321
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,599
photo on the advisory board and i

322
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,599
i sent it to her and i'm like what what

323
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,639
on earth when did you start

324
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,240
looking into cannabis research and

325
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,639
things of that nature and

326
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
you know it turns out that she lives um

327
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,079
lives near palin and they

328
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,759
they've known each other for years and

329
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,799
she was advising

330
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,480
as a board member in the insurance space

331
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,199
which is something that she's doing now

332
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
so

333
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,920
she connected me to palin and we had a

334
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,600
great conversation

335
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,919
and haley and jeff the other co-founder

336
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
jeff chen shared some ideas with me

337
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,240
about

338
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,839
what they wanted to do with radical

339
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,000
science and

340
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,279
it it hit all the right buttons and it

341
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
got me really excited and very

342
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,519
passionate

343
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,720
about being part of a company that

344
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,600
the entire mission is around uncovering

345
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,278
the data

346
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,720
around these natural medicines and

347
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,799
really empowering consumers and also

348
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,040
creating a source of data and insights

349
00:12:54,799 --> 00:13:00,159
for a variety of stakeholders so

350
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:03,519
i think um all those things have finally

351
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:06,399
come together in a in a beautiful way

352
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,320
well it's it's quite the journey and it

353
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,360
is a journey

354
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,079
and it stood out to me that it you've

355
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
started sort of in the pharmaceutical

356
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,719
industry

357
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,639
and now you're in cannabis which i mean

358
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,040
a lot of people would probably consider

359
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,839
opposite ends of the spectrum and then

360
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,919
another thing

361
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,399
that you you brought up was sort of this

362
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,679
whole idea of wellness versus illness

363
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,759
and i wonder

364
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,039
is there a connection there you know is

365
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,039
pharma more sort of

366
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,879
concerned with the illness in you know

367
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,199
cannabis and natural medicines more with

368
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,879
the

369
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:44,079
with the wellness i think you are

370
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:46,399
you are spot on um it it is a very

371
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,159
it's two sides of the same coin in some

372
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,039
ways and

373
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,838
i think that the pharmaceutical industry

374
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,480
is

375
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,399
you know is very necessary western

376
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,519
medicine is very important in many many

377
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,078
cases and

378
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,879
we've all used it to our advantage to

379
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,359
help us

380
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,240
over our lifetimes in many cases and and

381
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,278
i don't think

382
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,399
any of us would trade that for anything

383
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,720
the way it comes about is to solve

384
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,958
problems to figure out how to

385
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,399
address a particular illness

386
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,278
specifically

387
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,958
traditionally speaking i'm generalizing

388
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,320
but i think it's a i think it's a fair

389
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,439
generalization

390
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:29,199
and when you think about natural

391
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:32,800
medicines they've always been much more

392
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:35,519
geared towards achieving balance

393
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,799
and promoting wellness and optimizing

394
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,879
health

395
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,838
and that's been happening for for

396
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,480
centuries

397
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
they're also used to to manage illnesses

398
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,800
as well

399
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,920
and i think the the crux of radicals

400
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,799
is built on this idea of what if you

401
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,039
could use

402
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,159
a natural product some people quite

403
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,958
frankly just prefer

404
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,198
a natural product what if he could use

405
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,799
it

406
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:04,078
and be confident that it's been tested

407
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,719
that we understand how it works

408
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,319
and we understand how to use it and that

409
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,720
you could trust it in the same way that

410
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,000
you would trust a pharmaceutical product

411
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,639
so we're we're certainly not not

412
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,399
out to to squash any of the work that

413
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,519
the pharmaceutical industry

414
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,078
has done what we're trying to do is

415
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,240
create a path and a way forward for

416
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,559
natural products

417
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,759
yeah absolutely it's it's not a zero-sum

418
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,559
game there's

419
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,600
um there's room for both absolutely

420
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,879
absolutely

421
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,040
and it's you know it's coincidental that

422
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,039
you bring up this whole idea of

423
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,078
providing consumers with some sort of

424
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,319
way to

425
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,000
to trust that a certain product is going

426
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,560
to work and that it's been studied

427
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,240
i was just reading an article about a a

428
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,679
probiotic that's supposed to help with

429
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,919
athletic performance

430
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,719
specifically with endurance and i'm

431
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,479
training for

432
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,399
road races and things that are

433
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,079
eventually coming back online and

434
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,480
i was curious in that and i was sort of

435
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,000
trying to find information on

436
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,000
this type of product and wasn't really

437
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,879
able to find very much of

438
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,278
anything so i think that's a good segue

439
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,519
into

440
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,278
what you folks are doing at radical

441
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,879
science to try to

442
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:19,919
um get that data and talk a bit about

443
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:22,480
what your approach is for sort of

444
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,958
collecting data around these products

445
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
sure

446
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,000
sure so um you know fundamentally

447
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,479
speaking radical radical science is all

448
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,639
about

449
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,519
validating natural medicines for the

450
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,278
first time

451
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,919
and it's it was born out of the idea

452
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,519
that there has to be a better way

453
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,759
so our goal is to create

454
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,120
a movement and that movement would be

455
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,759
going towards

456
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,480
a democratized personal medicine system

457
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,440
where

458
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,240
where we have the potential to to share

459
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,120
information

460
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,839
and deliver well-being if you will to

461
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,278
everyone

462
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,519
and we we do that by disrupting

463
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,639
the traditional approach to to clinical

464
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,519
trials so

465
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,000
a you you can kind of think of us in in

466
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:11,119
some ways as

467
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,759
a a hybrid of a lot of things we we have

468
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,798
the reach

469
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:18,160
of a market research company but we

470
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:20,160
combine that with rigor um it's

471
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,640
it's of utmost important to us

472
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,798
importance to us that everything we do

473
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,199
is grounded in science and is incredibly

474
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,599
rigorous so you can compare that to

475
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,600
perhaps a research university and then

476
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,399
last but not least we're a health tech

477
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,439
company

478
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,600
so we also incorporate agility

479
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,880
into our approach and what we're doing

480
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,439
is studying natural medicines

481
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,080
in a similar fashion to the way that

482
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,200
pharmaceutical

483
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:52,798
products are studied so we have a

484
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,840
great group of advisors and scientific

485
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,918
experts combined with

486
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,038
the knowledge that our co-founders have

487
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,840
accumulated

488
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,798
over the past few years so um our

489
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,279
co-founders are

490
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,160
are jeff chen and palin thoroughgood and

491
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,558
they

492
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,679
you know built this company around all

493
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,720
of these ideas

494
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,280
after getting really frustrated

495
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,160
with the current model in their

496
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,639
respective

497
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,279
areas so um jeff i think you might you

498
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
might

499
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,399
know and have met a few times before but

500
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,599
he started up the ucla cannabis research

501
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,440
institute

502
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:31,279
and stumbled up against all those

503
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,960
challenges that we talked about before

504
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,639
with bureaucracy

505
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,600
and being able to do something in a

506
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,640
timely fashion a cost-effective fashion

507
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,879
things of that nature palin started

508
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,759
a foundation called the holistic

509
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,640
research and education foundation

510
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,759
and she's raising money basically to

511
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,120
help fund

512
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:55,599
these research projects and again

513
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,159
kept coming up against all these blocks

514
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,678
that

515
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,200
that made it much more difficult than it

516
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,840
needed to be so

517
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,038
the two of them came together and came

518
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,319
up with

519
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:08,720
an approach with the goal of reducing

520
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,839
the cost and time of research

521
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,480
while still providing rigorous health

522
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,519
data

523
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,319
so if that probiotic you mentioned

524
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,960
if we um if we were working with that

525
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,519
company

526
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
and and able to study it we would be

527
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,839
able to

528
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,038
provide potentially real world evidence

529
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,959
that would help you

530
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:34,240
understand as a man of your age

531
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,038
with your goals what might be the right

532
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,960
dose to help you what might be the right

533
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,279
time of day to take it

534
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,798
other areas that it might improve your

535
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,480
overall well-being

536
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,240
it would all depend on on how that

537
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,360
particular study was designed but we

538
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,599
would be able to provide that

539
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,439
information for you

540
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,119
so that's interesting you'd be able to

541
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,279
kind of provide

542
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,599
almost some personalized information

543
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,079
based off of demographics

544
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,558
absolutely and you know the personalized

545
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,399
aspect of it i think is something that

546
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,759
that we're very excited about as well

547
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,000
because the the

548
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,519
individuals that participate in our

549
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,880
studies

550
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:16,400
they're just as important as a customer

551
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,000
as as the folks that are the brands or

552
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,798
the customers that are paying for the

553
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,720
studies

554
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,240
and we want to make sure that they're

555
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,480
provided with value

556
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,839
because they're providing the research

557
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,079
community with value

558
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,119
so every participant in our studies gets

559
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,158
their own

560
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,439
data back in a personalized insights

561
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,400
report

562
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,440
so it will help them understand how

563
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
their

564
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,360
data looks amongst the the aggregate or

565
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,320
the cohort

566
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,719
in that study so they get a sense of oh

567
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,759
wow

568
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,159
you know the folks that that were taking

569
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,960
and i'm obviously making up an example

570
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,760
here but

571
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,279
the folks that were taking 25 milligrams

572
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,240
of cbd

573
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,038
had the best improvements in a sleep

574
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,000
score

575
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,919
i've only been taking 15. maybe i should

576
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,519
talk with my healthcare provider or

577
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
maybe i'm going to make the choice

578
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,960
myself

579
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,558
to try a product with a higher dose and

580
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,600
see if that actually helps me sleep a

581
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,480
bit better

582
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,599
so we're trying to to leverage that

583
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,720
power

584
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:23,359
in numbers and and share some true

585
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,759
insights back with these individuals

586
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,879
yeah so you say that the the individuals

587
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,798
are very important and

588
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
it definitely sounds like they are so

589
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,200
how do you recruit the individuals to

590
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,679
participate in these studies

591
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,720
a couple of different ways um you know

592
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,840
our model is

593
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,440
definitely direct to consumer from from

594
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,199
the perspective of

595
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,679
what we're doing in these virtual

596
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,759
clinical trials and

597
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:53,360
if um if you'd asked me prior to 2020

598
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:56,558
how how i felt about that concept

599
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,798
i i might say that it could be really

600
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,639
challenging because

601
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,798
there's a lot of different things to

602
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,200
wonder if people will actually

603
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,839
follow through with and and i think

604
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,440
covid

605
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:12,558
and the pandemic really showed us that

606
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,320
that consumers are very willing and able

607
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,240
to do things virtually

608
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,000
and it really helped prove out that that

609
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,880
model for us

610
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,319
and when we recruit participants for our

611
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
studies there's a couple of different

612
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,279
ways

613
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,000
we can approach it part of it is based

614
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,519
on the trial

615
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,038
design part of it is based on

616
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:35,279
what our brand is actually able to do

617
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,720
you know some brands are better set up

618
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,720
than than others from a customer list

619
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,079
perspective or recruitment perspective

620
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,919
so you know

621
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,240
we bring in our participants through

622
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,320
either working with a brand

623
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,400
and leveraging whatever list they might

624
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:54,158
have from their existing

625
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,000
customers if we want new participants

626
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,520
people who haven't tried a product

627
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,759
before we

628
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,279
can leverage a consumer research network

629
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,640
that we work with to get new

630
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,918
participants

631
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,600
and you know ultimately we we truly hope

632
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,280
that we we create a network effect and

633
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,199
the general public will start to know

634
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,399
about radical and and know about what

635
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,798
we're doing and

636
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,960
they're going to want to sign up and

637
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:22,639
really want to participate

638
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,360
to help generate data and grow this body

639
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
of evidence

640
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,558
not only for the community as a whole

641
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,319
but

642
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,599
but also for their own personal

643
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,809
information and learn about themselves

644
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,038
yeah i mean i think that last group

645
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,558
[Music]

646
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,879
is a really interesting one i think that

647
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,319
there's definitely a lot of people out

648
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,159
there who would be

649
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,319
very interested to try these new

650
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,200
products and and get a personalized

651
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,240
report

652
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,759
um based on that so is there any way

653
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,000
that people can

654
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,919
you know sort of sign up for to know

655
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,558
about what studies are coming up and

656
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,919
maybe

657
00:23:54,558 --> 00:24:00,399
you know take part absolutely

658
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
so we um we have our website up and

659
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,038
running and there's a couple of

660
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,200
different places

661
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,720
within the website that you can sign up

662
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,000
to be alerted about

663
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,679
future opportunities the website is

664
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,319
radicalscience.com and radical is

665
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,600
spelled

666
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,720
r-a-d-i-c-l-e so it's a

667
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,639
a little bit of a play on words um the

668
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,360
radical is the first part

669
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,440
of a plant root that emerges so it's

670
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,479
it's the seed of the idea

671
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,679
so we intentionally

672
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,440
created a created that play on words

673
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,000
because

674
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,720
it aligns with the concept of natural

675
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,679
medicines

676
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,159
and plant science and plant medicine but

677
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,400
also the fact that

678
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,480
the idea in what we're doing is is a bit

679
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,519
disruptive

680
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,440
yeah for sure i like that um

681
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,839
and you you mentioned that there are

682
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,400
different types of studies that you can

683
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,558
do

684
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,840
um does that include sort of like open

685
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,879
label or double-blind placebo-controlled

686
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,678
is that what you meant in

687
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,240
in some ways yes what we're doing right

688
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,320
now

689
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,278
are a couple of different study types

690
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,599
one of which is real world evidence so

691
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,200
we

692
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:23,839
know that particularly in the cbd area

693
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:27,038
that the fda has really been

694
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:30,000
asking for real world evidence

695
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,038
from from manufacturers from from

696
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,880
different brands

697
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,319
because there aren't any randomized

698
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,200
controlled trials

699
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,399
so real world evidence is is an

700
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,919
observational

701
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,840
approach if you will we also can do some

702
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,720
studies that

703
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,399
we call discovery studies that will

704
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,480
allow brands

705
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,038
a safe environment to look at different

706
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,079
formulations look at different products

707
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,038
and try to figure out which one is most

708
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,678
effective

709
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,200
and in what combination so if you can

710
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,519
imagine

711
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,759
think about all the cbd products out

712
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:08,839
there a lot of folks are combining in

713
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,640
other other apis active pharmaceutical

714
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,798
ingredients and

715
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,240
maybe maybe you're just not quite sure

716
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,400
does that need to be in a two-to-one

717
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,278
ratio a one-to-one ratio

718
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,278
something else altogether full spectrum

719
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,599
versus broad spectrum lots of

720
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,720
lots of different types of formulations

721
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,158
and combinations

722
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,720
and if you want to bring one to market

723
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,520
you want to be able to test it

724
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,240
understand

725
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,240
which one is most effective and save

726
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,519
yourself the time and effort of putting

727
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,079
something out there that

728
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,359
that may or may not work so we can help

729
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,918
in that way

730
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,719
and then last but not least and this

731
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,799
goes back to the idea of validation

732
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,720
is we can do those placebo-controlled

733
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,960
trials which will

734
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,759
validate the natural product and

735
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,360
actually allow

736
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,798
folks to be able to make structure

737
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,879
function claims

738
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,839
which is something that's really

739
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,760
important and

740
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:07,278
not done often in this area excellent

741
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,798
and are the results from these studies

742
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:13,679
made public absolutely

743
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,278
one of uh one of our core values is is

744
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,399
transparency

745
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,960
and we make sure that

746
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,879
the studies that we do particularly

747
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,759
those validation studies and such are

748
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,159
going to be

749
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,919
published um the real world evidence

750
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,480
studies most of those

751
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,759
will result in aggregate data

752
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,960
publications

753
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,759
but uh we're working on a really

754
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,200
interesting

755
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,558
multi-brand cbd study right now that

756
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,319
will launch

757
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,839
in june which will be um published in a

758
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,558
peer-reviewed journal

759
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,918
and you know we're going through all the

760
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,240
all the things we need to do to make

761
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,919
sure that happens and abiding by

762
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,440
all the regulations clinicaltrials.gov

763
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,000
irb submissions all the check boxes if

764
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,120
you will

765
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,919
you have to uh to fill in order to get

766
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,879
something into a peer-reviewed journal

767
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,640
yeah that's excellent

768
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,880
um and i was going to ask you about that

769
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,799
uh particularly clinicaltrials.gov

770
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,120
i i spoke with deb kimlis on a previous

771
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,359
podcast in her groups working on a

772
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,239
clinical trial on a cbd tablet for

773
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,879
chronic pain

774
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,120
that we um we discussed and and at the

775
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,840
end we were talking about you know

776
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:32,079
um what are some ways that consumers

777
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,398
can uh i don't know look for red flags

778
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,918
or

779
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,239
have a way to kind of validate some of

780
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,960
the claims that some manufacturers

781
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,599
make and one of her suggestions was to

782
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,079
check clinicaltrials.gov to look for the

783
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,319
real

784
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,599
robust clinical trials so i'm glad to

785
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:46,720
see you guys are on there not that i

786
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,278
doubted it but um

787
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,919
i'm glad to see that that um that advice

788
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:54,159
is

789
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:57,440
is sound absolutely um

790
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,080
you know the the consumer is is in a bit

791
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
of a

792
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,158
double quandary in my opinion because

793
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,599
they're trying to figure it out

794
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,320
and unlike other areas

795
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,240
there aren't necessarily as many

796
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,359
clinicians as you might imagine that are

797
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,000
familiar with

798
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,759
with cbd and natural products so there's

799
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,200
a lot of self-learning

800
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,398
and a lot of sorting through very

801
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,558
complex things

802
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,599
um you know when when you see something

803
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:28,000
on a website that says clinically proven

804
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,359
you you often take that for face value

805
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,839
and unless you dig

806
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,558
in and actually look to see what really

807
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,639
happened

808
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,678
you you don't know if that's a valid

809
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,240
statement or not

810
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:43,278
and our goal as an organization is to

811
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,278
ensure that if if someone hears that

812
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,119
that radical studied a product that you

813
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,759
know that that was done

814
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,719
with the highest level of rigor we have

815
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,759
a compliance

816
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,640
process that we ask brands to go through

817
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,720
where we we have a minimal set of

818
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,520
standards that were established by one

819
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,278
of our

820
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,519
collaborative partners clean label

821
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,960
project in order to make sure that

822
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,319
they're doing all the right things

823
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,759
from a manufacturing perspective and a

824
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,879
labeling perspective excellent

825
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,960
um i was wondering if you could talk a

826
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,440
bit about what studies you've done to

827
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,519
date

828
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,360
and or what other ones you have planned

829
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,599
i know that you've recently

830
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,479
announced a sleep study that launched in

831
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,319
april

832
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,399
um i wonder if you could speak a bit to

833
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,439
that and in other studies that you have

834
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:32,398
going on sure sure so um

835
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,798
radical is uh is fairly new the company

836
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,199
uh

837
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,000
kicked off last fall and you know we're

838
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,038
really excited

839
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,159
about the fact that we have uh a good

840
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,759
bit of

841
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:47,278
data getting ready to to come out um

842
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,200
one of the i think first things will be

843
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,119
released uh the first week or two of

844
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,558
june we worked with

845
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,239
a cpg brand to compare eight different

846
00:30:54,558 --> 00:31:00,079
cbd formulations

847
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,000
head to head and over one thousand women

848
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,678
so we feel that's even more important

849
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,319
because women's health is often

850
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,759
overlooked when it comes to research

851
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,439
and this information helped the brand

852
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,558
determine which product to bring to

853
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,278
market

854
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:16,798
and we're releasing a white paper with

855
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,398
details of that analysis

856
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:23,759
in june we've also been working

857
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:26,398
with two different cbd brands on

858
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,359
real world evidence studies and we've

859
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:28,879
been really

860
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,398
working with them to help them

861
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,559
understand their existing

862
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:33,678
customer base so this is one of the

863
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,839
cases where

864
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,679
they targeted their existing customers

865
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,119
to understand how they were using the

866
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,200
products and

867
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:44,719
and what experiences they were having

868
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,440
and and their perceived health outcomes

869
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,759
and then we also have the study that i

870
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,240
mentioned earlier the multi-brand study

871
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,839
which will be kicking off in june and

872
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,880
we're really excited about it

873
00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:00,079
it's called aces radical aces

874
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,399
advancing cbd education and science and

875
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,558
it's the first multi-brand observational

876
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:07,759
study on cbd efficacy

877
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,038
that covers anxiety sleep pain and

878
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,119
general well-being

879
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,798
and to our knowledge it's the the

880
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,558
largest and most comprehensive

881
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:17,440
longitudinal study

882
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,158
ever conducted to examine the the

883
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,798
efficacy

884
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,440
if you will of hemp drive cbd products

885
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:23,119
and

886
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,600
you know we're really excited to say

887
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:28,398
that um we have

888
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,480
as of today i think we're up to 14

889
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:34,158
brands that are participating

890
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,360
many of which are quite familiar and

891
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,039
i believe uh i believe you could

892
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,119
the top three brands in the us are

893
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:43,679
participating in the study so

894
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:47,199
we'll be able to share their names once

895
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,120
we announce the kickoff of the study

896
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,880
a couple other things that are going on

897
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,359
right now are

898
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,840
the sleep study you mentioned which

899
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:59,199
launched in

900
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:02,319
april and you know that was a really

901
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,480
great partnership because the brand is

902
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,000
is truly passionate about research and

903
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,558
science

904
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,440
they really want to understand how their

905
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,639
product is

906
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,880
is helping their customers and you know

907
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,278
they were able to partner with a variety

908
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,720
of

909
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,558
different other sleep related products

910
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,240
to raise awareness about the

911
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,558
availability of the study

912
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,240
and get folks involved and you know

913
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:26,720
they're they're essentially looking at

914
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,038
different

915
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,159
validated sleep indices over the course

916
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,599
of a 30-day

917
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,240
study period and we had

918
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,319
ultimately about 200 participants um the

919
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,399
study's still ongoing so

920
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,079
i can't tell you exactly how many are

921
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,639
going to end up completing

922
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,079
but the the original goal was to get 200

923
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,038
completers

924
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,839
and i believe um last patient out will

925
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,278
be

926
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:56,639
middle of june so there will be data

927
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,319
coming out from that study a couple of

928
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,278
weeks after that and

929
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:04,079
as a real world evidence study the brand

930
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:07,038
is committed to sharing the findings

931
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,159
and radical will take their lead on on

932
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,559
sharing the findings

933
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,519
as well so you know there'll be some

934
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,039
interesting stuff

935
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:17,119
to help us understand why they're using

936
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,480
cbd you know what's their their primary

937
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,639
motivation

938
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,760
what are they consuming when are they

939
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,320
using it and

940
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,079
and and how are they actually how are

941
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,359
they actually experiencing it

942
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,720
and what do they think about it so we're

943
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,719
pretty excited about that as well

944
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,319
yeah and we i don't think we talked

945
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,398
about it earlier but

946
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,359
um i believe when i was looking at your

947
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:41,918
website

948
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,799
that the way that the participants get

949
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,878
the data to you

950
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,200
it's through a an app on their mobile

951
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:50,639
phone correct

952
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,078
it's through a website interface okay um

953
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,320
we're reaching out to

954
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,079
we're reaching out to the uh the

955
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,119
participants in the studies

956
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,000
either via email or

957
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,280
text alerts so when you when you sign up

958
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,639
part of the study process

959
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,800
is choosing how you'd like to be

960
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,078
communicated with so we're working

961
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,599
through both options

962
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,640
um the the study platform itself

963
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,519
is uh is part of our proprietary

964
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,279
approach

965
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:21,599
and we are learning new things every day

966
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,119
and evolving it to make it to make it

967
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,760
better with each study we

968
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,880
we kick off yeah because i was curious

969
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,520
especially with

970
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,079
with a study about sleep that i know

971
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,838
that

972
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,680
you know certain wearable devices that

973
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,719
are pretty popular like

974
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,118
apple watch um fitbit and others they

975
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,279
have

976
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,119
sort of a sleep tracking capability and

977
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,760
i was curious if

978
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,720
any of that data would be valuable to a

979
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,960
study looking at cbd and sleep

980
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,118
that would absolutely be valuable um

981
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,159
this particular study doesn't include it

982
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,440
but that is uh definitely on our list

983
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:59,838
for the future to make sure that we

984
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,440
incorporate other technologies and other

985
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,759
potential

986
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,679
data gathering collaborations in order

987
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,839
to build that body of evidence because

988
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,719
the the more information you get

989
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,440
and the more you can connect and

990
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,919
correlate

991
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,440
you know what someone is saying and how

992
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,559
they're answering

993
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,760
those questions with actual

994
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:24,000
data from from one of those devices that

995
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,680
that tracks is going to be really

996
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,519
interesting

997
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,279
yeah cause i imagine that is a bit of a

998
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,320
a challenge with with some of these

999
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,240
studies as it's

1000
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,599
um you know self-reported data right

1001
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,759
it is yes um the questionnaires we use

1002
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,280
are validated questionnaires though and

1003
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,839
they're the same questionnaires that are

1004
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,440
used

1005
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:49,199
in in standard standard clinical trials

1006
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,280
so uh when when we start to release

1007
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,199
the insights in the data and we talk

1008
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,599
about certain indices

1009
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:58,559
and certain questionnaires it's the same

1010
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,400
thing being used by academic researchers

1011
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,239
so uh we think they'll get pretty

1012
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,599
excited about it it's not

1013
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,078
um it's it's not just a how are you

1014
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,440
today

1015
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,839
kind of kind of a question sure sure um

1016
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,679
so winding down here um i did want to

1017
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,599
you know touch on a couple

1018
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,279
relevant news topics that came out that

1019
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,720
i was curious how that might affect what

1020
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,640
you're doing there at radical

1021
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:24,319
uh the first being that cbd is

1022
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,078
the fda is talking about you know

1023
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,838
approving it as a food supplement

1024
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,359
um how will that sort of um

1025
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,358
affect what you guys are doing there at

1026
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,960
radical

1027
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,440
well i think it's i think it's super

1028
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,159
exciting um i mean we touched on this a

1029
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,599
little bit

1030
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:43,838
earlier you know see cbd is such a

1031
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,720
regulatory conundrum for lack of a

1032
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:49,199
better word

1033
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:52,319
um the farm bill makes hemp drive cpd

1034
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:55,679
legal yet the fact that

1035
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,960
the molecule itself is an approved drug

1036
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,719
epidialex from gw means that

1037
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,880
it's technically not a food supplement

1038
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:06,078
so it's uh it's this very

1039
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,200
very confusing gray area and getting it

1040
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,400
approved or

1041
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,279
getting it named as a food supplement if

1042
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,119
you will is

1043
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,320
is i think a great thing it's going to

1044
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,160
introduce

1045
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,359
a regulatory framework it's going to

1046
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,960
introduce

1047
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:24,719
structure and what we're doing now

1048
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,720
sets sets the stage for that so i

1049
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,159
i firmly believe that a lot of the

1050
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,519
information we're providing is

1051
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,799
ultimately going to be required

1052
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,759
information

1053
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,599
once uh once cbd is designated a food

1054
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,960
supplement

1055
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,440
yeah and how would that be different

1056
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,440
from other um supplement

1057
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,960
well other supplements or other natural

1058
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,639
products um

1059
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,199
are they sort of operating in that gray

1060
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:50,000
area as well

1061
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,199
well they're not because if they're

1062
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,838
deemed

1063
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,519
a supplement there's a very specific

1064
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,559
rules and regulations

1065
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,000
whether it be manufacturing claims data

1066
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,199
things like that that they're subject

1067
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,320
to whereas cbd itself right now is

1068
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,639
is not subject to those since it's not a

1069
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,680
food supplement

1070
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:14,719
got it got it and the other

1071
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:17,838
news item is this expansion of

1072
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,919
is essentially expanding the

1073
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,358
types of organizations that can do

1074
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,119
research into cannabis

1075
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,039
um i imagine that's going to open up a

1076
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,480
whole number of possibilities

1077
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:30,960
uh for different trials no absolutely

1078
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,079
um you know this one i'm i'm actually

1079
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,199
super excited about

1080
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,240
given given my work at columbiacare

1081
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,838
previously um

1082
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,000
it's it's been it's basically been a

1083
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,400
monopoly

1084
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,679
up until this point so you know since

1085
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,200
the late 60s

1086
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,319
there's only been one dea approved

1087
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,559
source

1088
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,160
of cannabis and and when i say cannabis

1089
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,960
in this sense i'm referring to

1090
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,838
thc containing cannabis hot products if

1091
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,679
you will

1092
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,119
and you know that that product came from

1093
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:04,399
the university of mississippi

1094
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,920
and you know the product that

1095
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,760
that was being provided most researchers

1096
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,079
and most healthcare practitioners

1097
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,920
felt that it wasn't representative of

1098
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,720
what's actually available in the market

1099
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,079
now

1100
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:20,799
and a lot of folks have been

1101
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,280
really leading the charge and pushing to

1102
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,400
to get

1103
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,680
these these research i'm going to use

1104
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,800
the word licensed

1105
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:32,799
licenses um open up

1106
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,000
so that they're able to provide

1107
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,079
medical cannabis products or cannabis

1108
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,199
products for these research studies such

1109
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,400
that there's more diversity in

1110
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:46,318
what you can use in the studies and

1111
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,680
that the products are actually more

1112
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:49,679
aligned with

1113
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,519
with what folks use on a day-to-day

1114
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:52,960
basis

1115
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,679
a lot of it has to do with like the

1116
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,440
percentage of of thc

1117
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,358
in the cannabis that was available for

1118
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,519
research versus

1119
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,400
the percentage that that folks are

1120
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,599
buying

1121
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,079
when they go to a dispensary and get

1122
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,480
medical

1123
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,560
cannabis so it's uh it's it's really

1124
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,599
the first chance to use real world

1125
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:17,358
cannabis

1126
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,079
in studies and and provide opportunities

1127
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,239
for

1128
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,760
for more scientists and more researchers

1129
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:25,199
to be able to actually do it

1130
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,920
um you know sue sisley in arizona has

1131
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,000
been

1132
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,838
leading this charge for years and has

1133
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,679
very successfully

1134
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,279
i believe received one of these licenses

1135
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,598
so it's pretty exciting to

1136
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,519
to hear that amongst a few other other

1137
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,559
folks i don't think they've released the

1138
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,000
full list this news is hot off the

1139
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,159
presses i believe it came out about a

1140
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,119
week or so ago so it'll be

1141
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,799
it'll be great to see the the full list

1142
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,480
and understand when these changes can

1143
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,160
start to be implemented

1144
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,800
and you know for us um not being part of

1145
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:59,759
an academic institution at radical

1146
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,240
where we haven't been held to the same

1147
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,480
types of

1148
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,519
rules that that academic institutions

1149
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,199
might be held to

1150
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:12,559
but opening it up in general

1151
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:15,679
all tides rise it will make the process

1152
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,000
a bit easier for everyone we haven't

1153
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,159
started

1154
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,358
doing cannabis studies yet but we will

1155
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,838
be uh doing those later this year

1156
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,838
yeah that's excellent and i agree with

1157
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:28,078
you that you know the more

1158
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,599
sites that we have exploring cannabis

1159
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,760
and

1160
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,960
kind of wading through or breaking down

1161
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,599
some of the restrictions that have been

1162
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,159
put on this

1163
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,838
then it's it's great for everyone and

1164
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,000
especially as the can med because we

1165
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:43,599
love to showcase all the great work that

1166
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,358
that everyone's doing in the space so

1167

that

1171
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,240
you'd like to make people aware of that

1172
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,639
they can connect with you or stay up to

1173

this year as we start to
