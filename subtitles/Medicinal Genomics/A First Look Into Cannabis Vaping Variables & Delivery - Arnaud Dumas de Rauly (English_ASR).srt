1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,980
hello everyone

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:06,839
um

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,880
thank you uh thank you very much for

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,580
sticking around until uh until the last

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,620
uh the last presentation I have to say I

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,780
feel super humbled to be up here

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,719
speaking because everyone in this room

8
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,820
is probably way smarter than I am and I

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,079
just want to thank everyone that we've

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,379
been talking to over the past couple of

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,598
days and thank you cadmed for

12
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:31,198
making this work

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,159
so vaping a lot of controversies I'm not

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,480
going to dive deep into a lot of detail

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,238
of of what's doable I just want to give

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,819
an overview because we still need to do

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,779
a lot of research when it comes to

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,480
vaping

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,600
we're going to specifically focus on

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,979
emissions and rheology

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,719
a lot of people talk about viscosity

22
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,299
when it comes to vaping well viscosity

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,739
is only a little piece of it there's a

24
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,058
lot more involved the process of

25
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:01,259
vaporization

26
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:04,920
is a mix between chemistry fluid

27
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:08,060
mechanics thermodynamics and not just

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,060
putting oil in a tank

29
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:15,658
one of the key things here to understand

30
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:18,359
as a consumer when you buy a product

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,500
you're not buying just the oil or just

32
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,840
the hardware

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,719
it has to be a symbiotic relationship

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,020
between the two you can have the safest

35
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:29,219
cleanest oil uh in a bad hardware and

36
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,719
the consumer will still have a bad

37
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,719
experience and vice versa

38
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:39,658
the initial goal of this was really r d

39
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:44,158
uh and understanding how we can better

40
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:46,320
deliver the cannabinoids terpenes uh all

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,859
of the different components that were

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,879
continually discovering every day for

43
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,239
patients

44
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,239
but we kind of made the scope a lot

45
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,519
bigger as we're pulling back these onion

46
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:03,319
layers of research and what's going on

47
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,319
with cannabis vaping

48
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,419
so what are the variables

49
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,818
that affect aerosolization everyone says

50
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,419
vaping but it's not really Vapor it's

51
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:18,000
aerosols through the use of for instance

52
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,458
a 510 thread cartridge and how do we

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,219
measure the influence the answer is

54
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,680
emissions testing and rheology

55
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,659
emissions testing is testing really The

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,700
Vapor that comes out of it all of the

57
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,579
regulation right now tests the oil that

58
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,919
goes into these devices the problem is

59
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,520
there's a state change there what comes

60
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,979
out of it is not at all what goes in

61
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,319
so obviously why do you do emissions

62
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:44,840
testing consumer safety

63
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:46,818
transparency

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,400
quality control

65
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:53,098
future Regulatory Compliance I think

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,659
it's very easy to understand that once

67
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:59,878
we enter Federal legalization FDA is

68
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:03,359
going to come in and they are going to

69
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,699
regulate the hell out of this and ask us

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,800
for all of this data it happened with

71
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:09,899
the nicotine vaping industry it happened

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,239
with food supplements it's going to

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,099
happen with cannabis and I think it's

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,580
very important that as an industry we're

75
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:20,939
prepared with data with information to

76
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,940
explain to these Regulators exactly how

77
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:26,818
things work and start working today for

78
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:29,158
future regulation

79
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,899
when we look at emissions

80
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:33,899
one of the components is a puffing

81
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:39,060
regime so a regular tobacco puffing

82
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,920
regime is 55 milliliters inhaled during

83
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,539
a puff for three seconds every 30

84
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,598
seconds

85
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:48,000
cannabis is consumed in a total

86
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,679
different way it's more sessions it's

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,378
only a couple of Puffs it's not

88
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,560
necessarily like a cigarette where you

89
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:57,780
have to have the 12 the 12 quote unquote

90
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,120
12 Puffs for one cigarette all at once

91
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,560
because it's consuming cannabis vaping

92
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,000
you can literally have it in your pocket

93
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,239
and some of you have seen me I've been

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,239
vaping for three days you can

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,980
Vaped completely differently and if you

96
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,120
want more info I think the decks are

97
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:17,279
going to be available there's a link

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,918
here that shows our 2021 survey of

99
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,799
vaping topography uh where we actually

100
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,659
come up with a vaping regime specific to

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,478
cannabis

102
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,100
so with that regime That's the basis for

103
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,839
all of the emissions testing because

104
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,360
emissions are different depending on the

105
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:36,299
regime of course

106
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,620
now looking into emissions

107
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,120
what's the link with rheology

108
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:47,459
there's there's a lot of different

109
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,600
moduli on storage loss doing a

110
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,799
temperature sweep I'm going to show you

111
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,720
some uh some some highlights after this

112
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,879
and most importantly how do we measure

113
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,360
all of this it's with the ACM the

114
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,478
aerosol collected Mass

115
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,120
leaking clogging of a cartridge

116
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:09,719
are are really a function of all of

117
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,579
these parameters and controlling those

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,780
parameters allows to bring a better

119
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,560
experience

120
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:20,000
better aerosol collected mass or better

121
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:23,579
deliverability for patients

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,079
now on the left side you see a

123
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,439
rheological report this is a temperature

124
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:31,560
sweep where we're basically testing the

125
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,139
product in a cartridge from 20 to 70

126
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,500
degrees Celsius on the left side you

127
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,180
have the consistent storage modulus that

128
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,060
is the blue line that is the most

129
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,680
important here the red line is viscosity

130
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:49,259
very easy same in in in both graphs

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,538
obviously goes down more uh with more

132
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,000
temperature

133
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:56,639
the green line is the loss modulus where

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,060
we do see a consistent loss of energy in

135
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,978
Pascal that's really what's expected now

136
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,978
the focus is the blue one that's the

137
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:08,459
storage modulus that's how much energy

138
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:11,300
in Pascal does the concentrate and the

139
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:14,339
Cannabis inside your vaping device store

140
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,100
basically it's it has to be something

141
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:19,859
fairly consistent for the deliverability

142
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,780
to be here and for bioavailability to

143
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,000
work with your patients and that's what

144
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,000
you don't see on the right side it's

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,639
basically the elasticity of the oil

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,399
that's in your cartridge

147
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,038
foreign

148
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,478
some of the variables and what they mean

149
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,459
when we're looking at emissions testing

150
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,538
so we just spoke about aerosol collected

151
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:46,079
Mass we also measure this of course with

152
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:49,740
dwl divide weight loss to correlate with

153
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:52,818
ACM and understand exactly what was

154
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,280
vaporizing how rheology

155
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:58,319
affects the emissions

156
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,179
pressure drop that's basically the

157
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,080
resistance to airflow that's when you're

158
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,079
simulating a puff

159
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:07,079
the delivered cannabinoids and I'm going

160
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,780
to show you a little slide at the end

161
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,339
where we can really pinpoint how the

162
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,019
cannabinoids are delivered throughout

163
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,899
the life cycle of a device or a

164
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,219
cartridge and it's it's scary sometimes

165
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,538
because some of the cannabinoids

166
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,280
actually disappear when you get towards

167
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,339
the end of the cartridge so if you're

168
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,899
looking for instance for a for CBN at

169
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:26,698
the end of the cartridge after using it

170
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:29,818
for a couple of days there's no more CBN

171
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,978
in there it all disappeared

172
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,598
so it's very very important to

173
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:35,719
understand how each of these

174
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,038
cannabinoids is delivered as well

175
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,500
something you'll see and you can see

176
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,839
this really everywhere in tobacco is the

177
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,478
aldehyde exposure now why would we look

178
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:49,258
at the aldehyde exposure that's really

179
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:51,719
the dry hits basically when your coil

180
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:55,620
and the medium the wicking material that

181
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,940
contains and and aerosolizes the the

182
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,399
extract

183
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,379
is burning and that's how we can measure

184
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,318
if there's a dry hit or if the wicking

185
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,899
material is uh has all the right

186
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,020
properties to encapsulate and deliver

187
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,879
that aerosol so very easily if you want

188
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,159
to simulate for instance a dry hit on

189
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,560
any cartridge take a couple of Puffs in

190
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,039
a row and you'll quickly see that the

191
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,019
last Puffs don't taste good and when you

192
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,360
measure that on a vaping machine you're

193
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,878
going to see that the uh the delivered

194
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,680
cannabinoids are completely different

195
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
off the charts not to mention the

196
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,918
potential degradance which I'm not even

197
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,639
covering here

198
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,679
and and finally heavy metal exposure

199
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,679
um there's a there's a lot of talk about

200
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,379
heavy metals and the uh the immediate

201
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,019
go-to is it's the device well actually

202
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:48,539
eighty percent of the heavy metal uh uh

203
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:50,220
results for cannabis and vaping products

204
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:52,679
comes from the oil

205
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,519
um that said what is responsible for

206
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,979
heavy metals in emissions is uh very

207
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,419
often due to the hardware and the

208
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,680
concentrate that you're putting into

209
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,539
these devices

210
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,179
to give you a very simple example you

211
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:08,458
look at distillate roughly a pH of four

212
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,559
the more terpenes you add the more pH

213
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,539
goes down the more acid it is and the

214
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,979
more leaching can happen with the

215
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:15,980
materials that are in your device

216
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:22,859
so this is basically the the three

217
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,980
potential results once you go through

218
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,560
all of this test is

219
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,759
a restrictive

220
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:35,278
um uh attribution uh which really shows

221
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,919
that there's potential aldehydes flavor

222
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,379
poor performance this is really again

223
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,419
the Genesis of Starting All of This

224
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,820
research is to make sure that we're

225
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,379
delivering product in the correct way to

226
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,240
patients

227
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:50,639
um when we're looking at something

228
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,740
that's oversized that means potentially

229
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,958
the intake holes are too big the wicking

230
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,600
material is is absorbed it's not

231
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,759
absorbing enough of the concentrate that

232
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,379
leads to clogging which then turns into

233
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,139
leaking

234
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:05,580
um and then there's the sweet spot and

235
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,379
that's where we hit the symbiotic

236
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,000
relationship between the hardware and

237
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:12,139
the concentrate

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
um is a proper feed in matched rheology

239
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:17,519
now you want to adapt and do rheology

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,639
testing with every single concentrate

241
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,220
out there it's practically uh impossible

242
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,338
but in certain cases when you're looking

243
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,100
at very specific applications it is

244
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,459
definitely needed and unfortunately not

245
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,500
many people are willing to do this in in

246
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,559
this industry I mean we're an ancillary

247
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,700
company we met manufacture Hardware

248
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,439
sometimes I get asked by my investors

249
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,839
why are we doing this research why other

250
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,540
processors doing it

251
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,459
um well we're neutral we can anonymize

252
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:50,039
we can take our clients oils and test it

253
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:52,379
without knowing which is which uh I

254
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,360
think a lot of the processors are afraid

255
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,500
of the liability of potentially finding

256
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,480
something that they're not going to like

257
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:02,000
and ending up with a master settlement

258
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,000
agreement in 20 years uh like tobacco

259
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,299
finally a little nugget of information

260
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,399
here this is what I was alluding to in

261
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,359
the beginning

262
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,759
we have three different types of

263
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,500
Hardware you can see when they're filled

264
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,559
at a hundred percent at 50 percent at

265
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,958
ten percent we track all cannabinoids we

266
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,559
also track terpenes I just put the main

267
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:25,500
two here CBD and THC and you can see

268
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:29,578
that in certain cases when the product

269
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,980
is for instance 10 percent full you see

270
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:35,399
these numbers change drastically

271
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,278
now when you're providing these products

272
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,720
to patients who don't know anything

273
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,059
about the science who don't know

274
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,639
anything about cannabis it's very very

275
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,679
important that they are made aware that

276
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,078
at the end of the cartridge you're not

277
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,199
going to have the same experience uh

278
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:54,539
than than at the beginning of it

279
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,019
basically is decreased efficiency

280
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:59,699
um over time with with this hardware and

281
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,320
this is something that no one's ever

282
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,940
going to be looking into because it's

283
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,500
essentially admitting that the hardware

284
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,800
doesn't match the oil

285
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,940
but it happens today in 95 percent of

286
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,939
the products that are on the market

287
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,879
um that that's it thank you um thank you

288
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,879
very much
