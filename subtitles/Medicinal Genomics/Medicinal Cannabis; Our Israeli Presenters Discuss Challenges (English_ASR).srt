1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:15,510
I believe that once we should know that

2
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:17,939
there is a complete there should be a

3
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,490
complete separation between recreational

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,859
cannabis and medicinal cannabis and the

5
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,500
reason is that in medicinal cannabis or

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,750
people that take cannabis as a drug for

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,910
people that do research and medicinal

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,210
cannabis have to know that it has to

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,600
follow medical regulations a patient

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,030
should have to know the exact amount of

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,579
material is getting you should know how

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,210
to get it and you should be in constant

13
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,609
contact with with a physician

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,158
recreational cannabis is a social issue

15
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:54,198
decisions and recreational cannabis have

16
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:57,600
to be made by society not necessarily or

17
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:59,280
not even at all on medical grounds the

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,710
reason is that they're two different

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,899
things so we should not mix them

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,960
together we should try to move the

21
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,140
medical cannabis as much as possible

22
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:12,689
towards the medical reasons for using a

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,629
drug and that's what happening in Israel

24
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,969
we're changing it we're not there yet -

25
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:21,259
we're changing it I hope that we shall

26
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:26,069
be there within the next few months so

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:28,800
patient who who is allowed to get

28
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:31,259
cannabis for his specific disease not

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,450
for any disease for his specific disease

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,540
whether it's pain with gastrointestinal

31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,280
problem like Crohn's the weather is

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,060
anything else that's approved like

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,739
epilepsy for example the person or his

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,990
parents her parents should know exactly

35
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:51,209
what mixture he is getting because

36
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:54,319
cannabis medical cannabis is a mixture

37
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:57,419
it's a mixture not just of THC and CBD

38
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,029
but also a lot of other compounds

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,430
including some therapies so a person

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,950
should know as much as possible on what

41
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,868
is the drug that he's taking we started

42
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,628
about the recreational use and

43
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:15,800
men often I am asking the Parliament

44
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:18,590
meetings about our opinion about

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,260
recreational use of cannabis in my

46
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,560
either answer is the same

47
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:27,590
I mean we are physicians we do not deal

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,959
with social decisions so the current

49
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,628
elevation on use is a social decision

50
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,030
which should be made by the Parliament

51
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:37,969
the government not by us by physicians

52
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,870
at present we are working for example on

53
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:44,209
brain trauma we found many years ago

54
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,659
together with dr. with Professor st

55
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:51,769
shock army that cannabinoids help in

56
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:54,049
brain trauma in mice it's a little bit

57
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:57,650
difficult to do brain trauma more

58
00:02:54,049 --> 00:03:01,370
experiments in humans so it has been

59
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:04,250
done in mice and it helps specific

60
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,039
compounds whether they are the natural

61
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:11,110
ones the one that we make the endogenous

62
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:14,150
cannabinoids whether THC or

63
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,829
cannabidiol from the plant or these up

64
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,260
in different ways there are also

65
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:21,040
additional compound surprisingly which

66
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:23,870
are found in our body which resembled

67
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,848
structurally at least some of the other

68
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,939
compounds I mentioned and these

69
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:32,119
compounds also help with brain trauma so

70
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:35,539
is there no drugs in helping with brain

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,900
trauma at the moment I assume that we

72
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:42,259
can help in this particular field forty

73
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:45,590
percent of our patients today oncology

74
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:48,769
patients suffering from pain from the

75
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,590
test awfully for the robot II resulted

76
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:55,700
from the treatment with excellent

77
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,159
results sometimes I'm a little bit a

78
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,810
confusion I have to present this and

79
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,259
then when I presented the results in

80
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:06,289
Department some of the dominant members

81
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:09,828
there were somewhere minute

82
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:11,099
it's me as a representative and why

83
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,719
don't you allow treat

84
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,230
two families for everyone ecology

85
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:20,250
patient in Israel it closes cannabis and

86
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:24,780
I have to call the realtor I'm not sure

87
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:27,750
if you but I'm sure it's x-ray CT

88
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,679
symptomatic later on when we see the

89
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,750
results of the new researches I hope

90
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,379
even more from the disease which is a

91
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:40,800
IBD inflammatory bowel disease and I was

92
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,409
diagnosed for four or five years ago and

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm currently treated with medical

94
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,820
Mirada

95
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:53,970
with some other drugs and so my personal

96
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:59,689
experience as a user I can't really say

97
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:02,130
for a hundred percent percent that I'm

98
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:04,829
better because of the medical cannabis

99
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:08,519
but I can say that I'm very well

100
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:11,219
balanced overall and before I started

101
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:15,359
using medical cannabis it wasn't so it's

102
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:18,470
not an scientific proof but that's the

103
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,069
fact regarding what my grandfather said

104
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:26,760
in medical school we now learn more

105
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:30,300
about cannabis especially in the field

106
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:36,110
of pain and comparing to other pain

107
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:41,939
drugs such as opiates and stuff and I'm

108
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:45,660
I'm confident that our colossal doctors

109
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:47,850
to be will know more about cannabis and

110
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,280
will be more involved in this industry

111
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,680
which is the biggest problem with the

112
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,389
physician service medical cannabis when

113
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,920
they prescribe medical cannabis to a

114
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,819
patient you can get something something

115
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,480
that has 25

116
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:05,909
% HC and novel CBD or the opposite or in

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,530
the boot or in between and this is even

118
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,270
before he started talking about the

119
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:10,250
other compounds which are still in

120
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,959
research

121
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,689
when you say medical cannabis what do

122
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,849
you mean what what do you mean we said

123
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:20,490
that's exactly the problem

124
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:24,390
that is this is exactly the the problem

125
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,340
that I'm facing I need to know before is

126
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,959
double-blind for everything else I need

127
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,539
to know that I'm prescribing something

128
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:34,139
to a patient that he will get the same

129
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,660
thing every time which is not currently

130
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:40,649
not exactly the situation you cannot

131
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,650
give a patient just something it's there

132
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:46,409
it's medical cannabis medical cannabis

133
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:49,049
is not a medical term it's just a

134
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:53,400
general that we should know exactly why

135
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,620
we stand and we should try to push those

136
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,799
that prepare the drugs the growth of

137
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:03,090
those that prepare the drugs to have an

138
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,120
every single type of preparation whether

139
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:10,289
it's an oil whether it's a smoking

140
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,860
whatever the exact amount of a piece of

141
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,280
this at this point of THC and CBD maybe

142
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,129
later

143
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,679
other things but at least these two

144
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:22,589
because otherwise where we are not there

145
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,160
we are not in medicine this is not the

146
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:25,159
way to do it

147
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:49,910
