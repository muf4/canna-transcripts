00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:12,439
I mean for a lot of us in the industry

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:14,638
we take a lot of this information for

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,239
granted and assume that it's common

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,160
knowledge but it really isn't so having

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,518
a show like this that's more accessible

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,118
to the general public so that they can

8
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:25,559
start understanding what we already know

9
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,599
um is very

10
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,278
powerful you know I ran up against that

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,679
one at the History Channel you know when

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,200
when we first took over history it was

13
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,479
there was a lot of criticism that we

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,960
were showing shows that weren't really

15
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:38,640
about history and I thought well you

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,520
know everything we do is about history

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,120
but what we did find was that

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,640
it it inow television is a wonderful

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,280
means of expressing emotion it is a

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,079
terrible means of giving

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,120
information um but if you tell as I say

22
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,320
if you have it's a great emotional

23
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,799
that's like you know you see a cotton

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,679
commercial and you cry right I mean it's

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,158
uh so it has a

26
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:05,840
it it triggers people um and the one the

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
most successful thing we did at history

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,400
was that it wasn't so much that we were

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,359
just reciting like a historical

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,439
encyclopedia we just got people excited

31
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,599
about history and as they got excited

32
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,039
about history we went from the number 34

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:23,599
Network up to number

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,079
three um and people knew where they you

35
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,798
know you get them excited about American

36
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:29,039
history they go on to the internet and

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,040
they learn about it here if we get

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
people excited about cannabis they'll

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,799
start doing their research they'll come

40
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,719
back to you and they'll find

41
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,960
you um rather than having to go to the

42
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,719
conference they'll be doing their own

43
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,319
research because of their passion and

44
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:45,920
then they'll find you excellent you know

45
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,559
the other thing the other Beauty about

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
the show uh a lot of people think that

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,840
these entrepreneurs are just sitting

48
