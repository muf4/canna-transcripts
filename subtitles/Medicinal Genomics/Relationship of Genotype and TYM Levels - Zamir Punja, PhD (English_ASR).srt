2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:16,739
all right

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,839
that uh Growers seem to struggle with

4
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,219
but total Easter mold is and we did say

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,019
that we were going to talk about some of

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,079
the factors that your your team

7
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,420
identified so let's get into that and I

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,979
think one of the major ones

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,900
um that you identified that was in this

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,899
paper was that the plant genetics

11
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:35,939
themselves uh play a huge role in the

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,739
tym levels

13
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,378
um I wonder if you could speak a bit to

14
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:43,439
that and is it specifically like the

15
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:45,479
physical structure of the plant in the

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,738
in the flowers that leads to that or is

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,839
there something else going on like does

18
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,119
it have something to do with immunity

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,980
yeah yeah so that that was a bit of a

20
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,079
surprise to us as well and I'm sort of

21
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,819
glad we really included like seven or

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,939
eight different types of genetics or

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,960
genotypes right in the study

24
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,939
um obviously when we're grabbing

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,618
whatever whatever we could whatever was

26
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,140
being grown at the time so it wasn't a

27
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,478
planned experiment but we did find

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,060
definite differences between the the

29
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,579
types of of cannabis that were being

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,439
grown primarily it's to do with the

31
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,079
morphology and the size of the flower

32
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:22,919
structure so the larger the the flowers

33
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,500
you know the bigger the the mass if you

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,019
wish or volume the higher the yeast and

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,420
mold in general plants that produce very

36
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,359
small buds smaller buds many of them but

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,879
smaller in size not as dense seem to

38
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,159
have less over over Eastern low so there

39
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,399
was definitely this physical uh

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,439
correlation in some cases I do think

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,680
there were chemical products chemicals

42
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,719
produced in the flower that would be

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,299
would be inhibiting yeast and mold now I

44
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,039
I say that because

45
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,020
some some of these flowers were the

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,240
Eastern mold was so low

47
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,819
that it was almost impossible to explain

48
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,679
just from the fact that the flowers were

49
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,199
small I think they were secreting some

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,780
kind of a chemical product a natural

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,219
chemical product that was it was

52
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,239
preventing these Eastern walls from

53
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,979
growing if we knew what those were boy

54
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,959
it would be we'd be off to a really good

55
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,340
start from a research perspective I mean

56
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,900
definitely that's something that needs

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,900
to be looked at I don't think it's

58
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,520
something like terpenes or or some of

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,879
these other volatiles that we know it's

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,040
definitely not THC or CBD because all of

61
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,739
these were producing THC CBD something

62
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,840
else that that perhaps isn't on the

63
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,180
radar yet something that other

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,759
researchers or breeders may want to look

65
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,219
at but certainly flower structure flower

66
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,139
size and the reason though the larger

67
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,900
flowers seem to have more yeast to mold

68
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:48,539
is the humidity the moisture in those

69
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,760
flowers is higher by three to four

70
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,098
percent in terms of relative humidity

71
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,280
than the outside air and their

72
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:58,259
temperature builds up in the flower it's

73
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,739
almost a mini it's a mini Greenhouse

74
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:04,199
sitting on a flower on a plant because

75
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,659
it traps the solar radiation and it

76
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,598
warms up the buds warm up two three

77
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,158
degrees higher than the environment so

78
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,979
that humidity and moisture the

79
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,259
temperature creates this little

80
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:19,318
Greenhouse that allows these yeasts and

81
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,899
molds to build up so one thing we asked

82
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,658
ourselves well if you if you circulate

83
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,000
the air you know you turn a fan on close

84
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:29,158
to the plants and let this air to

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,120
infiltrate through the flowers what

86
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,400
would happen

87
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,580
and boy the yeast and moles dropped by

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,739
90 percent oh wow now you can't go out

89
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,840
put a fan next to every plant but

90
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,000
certainly you increase your your air

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,000
flow your air movement the humidity

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,699
drops the temperature drops and your

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,739
flowers have way less yeast and mode

94
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,539
and it's not impractical in some

95
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,599
greenhouses you can set up eight or ten

96
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:56,878
fans blowing in a certain direction and

97
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,199
that will really reduce the yeast and

98
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,219
mold

99
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:06,060
yeah and you know I'm I and I imagine

100
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,500
Growers too would be encouraged to to

101
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,299
hear you say that there could be

102
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,979
something more than just the morphology

103
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,700
of the buds that that's contributing to

104
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,560
it

105
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,459
um because I mean because if you think

106
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,160
about it Growers want big dense flowers

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,439
and to have that be associated with

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,259
higher tym well that's that's not good

109
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,000
news at all well no certainly and so the

110
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,220
chemicals are discovered which they will

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,259
be actually uh that will be very very

112
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,020
useful because that's a natural way for

113
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,840
the plant to you know to protect itself

114
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,000
now plants don't have a an immune system

115
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,519
but they do secrete many many chemicals

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,160
and many of these chemicals are known to

117
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,639
inhibit the growth of mold and bacteria

118
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,320
and so on and so finding that strain or

119
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,319
strains would be very useful

120
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,519
foreign

121
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:06,189
