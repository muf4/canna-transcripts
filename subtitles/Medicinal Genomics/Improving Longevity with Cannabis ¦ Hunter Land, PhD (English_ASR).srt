I came at 23 Hunter's presentation was

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,799
titled effect of cannabinoids and canned

28
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,140
flavins on neurodegeneration lifespan

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,700
and health span which is the basis of

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,500
our conversation today

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,259
you can find a link to that presentation

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,019
video in the show description

33
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,700
topics will be discussed include

34
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:41,699
defining lifespan Health span and

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,280
Longevity why C elegans are good

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,540
organisms for studying toxicity and

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,060
longevity

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,640
the Entourage effect more specifically

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,740
whether a combination of compounds has a

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,939
greater effect on longevity than single

41
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,280
compounds

42
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,039
how cannabis compounds compare to other

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,540
longevity drugs like metformin and

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,259
Resveratrol

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,399
weather cannabis compounds could be used

46
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:07,560
prophylactically for conditions like

47
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,959
Alzheimer's and Dementia

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,259
determining the ideal dosing range for

49
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,500
cannabinoids and finally whether CBD and

50
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,799
CBG could or should be incorporated into

51
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,719
a healthy lifestyle to improve longevity

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,819
before we get to my conversation with

53
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,159

[Music]

75
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:26,340
good morning Hunter thanks so much for

76
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,598
joining us on the podcast thanks for

77
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,519
having me Ben

78
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,378
right well I'm excited to talk with you

79
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,599
today about the potential for cannabis

80
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:36,060
compounds to enhance Health span and

81
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,799
lifespan but before we discuss the

82
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,120
research that your team's done I think

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,519
it's important that we Define those

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,299
terms for the audience so please uh if

85
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,759
you could please do sure there's some I

86
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:51,239
would say important intricacies uh the

87
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:53,699
difference between lifespan and um and

88
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,120
Longevity right so this is longevity is

89
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:59,459
a hot topic now uh lifestan span as you

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,519
would expect you know typically refers

91
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,519
to the length of life within a species

92
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,459
and when we talk about longevity it's

93
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,400
really focused on who exceeds that kind

94
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,739
of mean lifespan throughout that uh in

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,259
that specific species and obviously

96
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,298
that's a goal of many people

97
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:22,259
um because you know longer healthier

98
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:25,198
lives is something that most of us try

99
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,939
to achieve hellspan on the other end is

100
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,240
a measure of

101
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,500
activity and more around quality of life

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,720
so

103
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,759
um you may be able to extend life or

104
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,940
some people may live longer but actually

105
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,340
have very poor quality of life you know

106
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,418
what's what's the point of living longer

107
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,000
if it's

108
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:47,758
um if it's uh you know riddled with

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,040
hospitalizations and lack of activity so

110
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,639
that that could be a problem

111
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,979
great so what made you interested in

112
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,680
investigating how cannabis can affect

113
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:00,360
longevity well this actually started out

114
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,340
with the conversation with the FDA

115
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,860
because you know with uh with the

116
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:07,258
legalization of CBD or the removal from

117
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,939
the controlled substance act the FDA had

118
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,879
a lot of concerns with you know what

119
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:14,819
happens if you take CBD for an extended

120
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,120
period of time so 20 years 30 years is

121
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:21,240
something going to pop up down the road

122
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,740
that could be detrimental and um you

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,259
know it's obviously very difficult to do

124
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,939
those studies in humans and it's even

125
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,639
difficult to do them in rodents it's

126
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,319
very expensive it takes a you know

127
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,620
extended period of time maybe three five

128
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:38,099
years to look at at lifespan depending

129
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,139
on that specific species one of the I

130
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,600
would say best pre-clinical whole

131
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,699
organism models is the C elegans model

132
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,340
it's kind of like the canary and the

133
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:51,900
coal mine model

134
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:53,698
the EPA likes this for toxicity so for

135
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:55,500
example if there was potentially

136
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,120
contaminated water

137
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,399
if they don't know what they're testing

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,259
for it's difficult to determine you know

139
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,560
what the problem is and if it's really a

140
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,660
danger so they may use C elegans and if

141
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,478
they die early then you probably want to

142
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,860
stay away from the that particular water

143
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,899
it's also been used

144
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,780
um in the International Space Station by

145
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:18,299
NASA so you know what's the EXP what's

146
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:20,339
the the you know what happens when

147
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,800
you're at space for an extended period

148
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,418
of time we don't really know what that

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,699
means for humans but we can look at

150
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:30,659
other animal models so that was really

151
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:32,759
the the start of this work was hey is

152
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,939
this toxic and at what level would it be

153
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,160
toxic and how does that you know affect

154
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,918
um you know the life of these in this

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,900
particular model

156
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:46,139
interestingly enough what we found is it

157
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:48,538
wasn't really that toxic uh until you

158
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,600
went to Super physiological amounts and

159
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:53,399
still wasn't you know overtly toxic

160
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,020
um but then we started seeing this you

161
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,538
know increase in lifespan and health

162
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:00,060
span uh we also ran that model with

163
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:03,478
canaba Gerald a lesser-known cannabinoid

164
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,418
and we saw similar similar effects so

165
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:09,418
both appeared non-toxic and

166
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:11,818
physiologically relevant amounts and uh

167
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,859
extended lifespan and activity levels

168
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,860
during that life so

169
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,500
um you know rather as it would now again

170
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,460
this is a model but as it would apply to

171
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,439
humans it would be akin to you know a 80

172
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,439
year old acting more like a 60 year old

173
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,060
in terms of health span measures so not

174
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,339
only did they live longer they were more

175
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,360
active through that late stage of their

176
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,818
life

177
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,500
so the benefits of Health span and

178
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,139
lifespan it sounds like it was sort of

179
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,759
just a happy coincidence like you were

180
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,220
originally looking at the toxicity but

181
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,919
then observed um this positive effect

182
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,740
sure we we wanted you know we obviously

183
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,258
wanted to to find out you know how safe

184
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,478
the compounds were were but obviously

185
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,000
when you when you find out that there's

186
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,459
a potentially larger more profound

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,860
benefit then that's uh and that's

188
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,879
something it's certainly important and

189
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,538
relevant

190
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,360
um

191
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:09,719
for us within the cannabinoid industry

192
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,939
great and so prior to to this work had

193
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,160
any research been done into cannabis and

194
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:17,038
Longevity and if so what kind of makes

195
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,180
this research unique not not to my

196
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,159
knowledge

197
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,300
um I think this was the first you know

198
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,699
uh full duration lifespan model there

199
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,978
have since been several other repeats

200
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,080
where you see similar lifespan extension

201
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:34,559
some diving down into potential

202
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,360
mechanisms and and you know we took

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,699
those data you know following these

204
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,918
studies and said hey well if this could

205
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,800
help you know General longevity what

206
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,958
does it then do in a disease model right

207
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,479
so then could we apply this to something

208
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,639
like Alzheimer's Dementia or does this

209
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,740
have broader applications to different

210
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,458
disease States like traumatic brain

211
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,139
injury epilepsy those sorts of things

212
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,399
excellent and so

213
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,559
yeah I want to talk a little bit more

214
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,299
about Ciel against or they're also

215
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,179
called nematodes correct yeah they're

216
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,979
they're in nematode and so they have an

217
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,679
endocannabinoid system

218
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,839
uh they have something very Akin I would

219
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,899
say akin to the endocannabinoid system

220
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:19,080
but which I would say would probably be

221
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,839
less relevant for a compound like CBD or

222
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,420
cannabijerol because uh the primary

223
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,760
function is not through endocannabinoid

224
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,979
system you know there are some data

225
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,259
suggesting that CBD may be in negative

226
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,778
allosteric modulator but

227
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,379
um in humans it doesn't seem to it

228
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:39,778
doesn't seem to some of the recent data

229
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:42,659
presented in the last month or so CBD

230
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:45,240
may actually have like a pkpd

231
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:48,299
interaction with THC and and boost

232
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,879
exposure so it doesn't seem that CBD the

233
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:54,599
effect that CB1 is enough to really

234
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:57,059
bring down the effect of of THC so if it

235
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,220
does work on the endocannabinoid system

236
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:01,500
I would say that's probably a minor

237
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,080
contribution to its effects

238
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,519
okay and so and I think you already you

239
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,500
said this too but just so I want to make

240
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,639
sure I understand it correctly too that

241
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,860
you know

242
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,080
the C elegans in these nematodes it's

243
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,940
easier to study lifespan and then

244
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,740
because their lifespan is so short right

245
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,519
right

246
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,980
six seven days 20 days you know so you

247
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,820
can run a lot of different compounds

248
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,440
in an inexpensive model so if you wanted

249
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,540
to look at many combinations of

250
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,600
cannabinoids many different cannabinoids

251
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:36,719
or like more recently we looked at uh

252
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,000
can flavins you can do that kind of in

253
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,519
parallel within the same model

254
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,339
um and kind of get this determination of

255
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,500
which compound is most likely to win or

256
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,079
at least have a better chance to win and

257
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,578
and hopefully be less toxic

258
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,679
yeah and I wanted to talk about that too

259
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:54,838
because in your presentation you talk

260
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,419
about sort of this initial research that

261
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,940
you did with CBD and CBG on sort of the

262
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,860
the wild type c elegans

263
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,200
um and saw the benefit and then sort of

264
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,200
as you mentioned did that secondary

265
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,879
experiment on the the towel model to

266
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,140
kind of see how it could help with with

267
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,159
diseases

268
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,439
um and what I thought was interesting

269
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,719
about that one is that you weren't just

270
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,700
looking at isolates there of like single

271
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,740
compounds but you also looked at sort of

272
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,140
whole plant formulations and then with

273
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,060
canned flavins too so kind of um explain

274
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,220
how that one different from from the

275
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:28,500
first experiment you did well well sure

276
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,720
I mean there's I think for years now

277
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,059
there's been this interest in you know

278
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,519
rational polypharmacy as it applies to

279
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:38,518
cannabinoids or the Entourage effect and

280
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,578
and I've done quite a bit of work uh

281
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,159
thanks to my mentor ether Ethan Russo

282
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:46,379
years ago it certainly had a lot of

283
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,600
interest in this area and you know

284
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:51,000
sometimes we see an Entourage effect and

285
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,159
sometimes we see what I call like a

286
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,559
non-terrage effect and I think this is

287
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,419
most profound in interocular pressure

288
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,939
models where you see reduction and

289
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:03,778
interocular pressure with THC but if you

290
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,060
had CBD it it basically prevents that

291
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:06,958
effect that reduction in their ocular

292
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,599
pressure

293
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,000
so I think that's just one example of of

294
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,639
how you could see Synergy or or

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,759
something you know the opposite of

296
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,740
synergy right and um so so this

297
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,379
particular model the Tau model we really

298
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,060
wanted to dive in and see you know are

299
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:27,480
we seeing this additive or super

300
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:31,259
additive effect with a complex Botanical

301
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,839
mixture with known components

302
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:38,100
um we the primary components in this

303
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:42,360
Botanical mixture were THC CBG and

304
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:44,700
um CBD so and we pegged everything at

305
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,620
the CBD level so we you know based on

306
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,060
the previous model we use CBD as a

307
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,299
positive control

308
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:54,000
as we know it extended lifespan and wild

309
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:57,179
type we didn't know how it affected the

310
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,100
talusi elegans not many things are are

311
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,199
really that effective at increasing

312
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,440
survival rate and these you know highly

313
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,940
Affiliated nematodes uh so we did you

314
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,160
know kind of our best guess and then we

315
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,500
could use that to compare to both canned

316
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,919
flavins and these Botanical mixtures

317
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,299
again all pegged at that same CBD level

318
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,439
so

319
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:18,719
um

320
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,180
that led us to some pretty interesting

321
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,220
results where we do see you know this

322
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:25,739
profound effect with these Botanical

323
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,440
drug substances versus

324
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,320
um versus just the CBD alone

325
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,820
right so score one for the Entourage

326
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,800
effect

327
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,079
in this particular model in this

328
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,599
situation with these cannabinoids I

329
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:42,419
would say yeah I think that's a

330
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,820
clearly shows there is synergy or an

331
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:47,219
Entourage effect you know if you change

332
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,079
this ratio or use different cannabinoids

333
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,079
you know I think it's important to be

334
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:54,179
specific to you know Entourage isn't

335
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:57,000
necessarily like oh it's a mystery suit

336
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,919
but it came from a plant well you know

337
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,339
what components are there I mean if I

338
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:04,199
would have put CBN or CBE or some other

339
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,180
cannabinoid in there I've I have no idea

340
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,680
if that would have helped further if it

341
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,199
would have hindered some of these

342
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:13,859
results and when we you know we really

343
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,320
didn't see with the canned flavins so in

344
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,860
the second study you know CBDs showed

345
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,500
about a 10 survival rate versus four in

346
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,659
the wild type at day 16.

347
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,019
um and cam flavum was better than that

348
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:29,699
at day 14 it was about 14 or day 16 it

349
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,700
was about 14 percent

350
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,259
so you know we would hope that it would

351
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,820
have an added of a further additive

352
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:38,639
effect when you added it to the

353
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,379
Botanical drug substance but there was

354
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
really no there was no negative but

355
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,820
there wasn't much of an Entourage maybe

356
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,458
a little bit of improvement

357
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,260
um but not even to the point where you

358
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:51,899
know it's typically you would think of

359
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:53,698
additive as one plus one equals two in

360
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,639
terms of you know I'm taking a

361
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:58,439
medication for let's say pain and you've

362
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,180
got two different components they both

363
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,000
work on their own you add them together

364
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:05,578
one plus one equals two super additive

365
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,740
would be one plus one equals four

366
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:09,419
and that's what you would hope for and

367
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,879
that's what we saw with the Botanical

368
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:14,278
drug substance but we didn't see that

369
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,039
when we added in the can flap and so it

370
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:20,159
was somewhat better but not you know we

371
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,019
didn't go from 25 survival to 40

372
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,600
survival

373
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,179
great but there may be limits to how far

374
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,320
you can push this this kind of Entourage

375
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:31,679
effect

376
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,839
right and so this Botanical drug

377
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,000
formulation now is that a whole plant

378
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,800
extract or is that just combining

379
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,980
different isolates into like a

380
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:43,139
formulation so under the Botanical drug

381
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,879
guidance you can essentially blend to a

382
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,220
specification

383
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,899
um from extracts and that's kind of

384
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,000
that's probably the best way to keep

385
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:54,179
things consistent that's what we did

386
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,399
with satavex at GW so it was a high THC

387
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,500
came of war and a high CBD team of war

388
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,500
that were you know climate controlled

389
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,360
and consistent but then you blend to a

390
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,759
certain specification so you always have

391
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,980
that particular ratio and essentially

392
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,720
that's what we did here is we use

393
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,379
different extracts to blend to a

394
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,600
specific ratio and then we also use the

395
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:17,939
camflaven extract to blend into to this

396
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,040
for this particular study yeah because

397
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,440
the reason I ask is if it's you know

398
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,360
sort of a a whole plant extract is there

399
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,339
the possibility too that there is a

400
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,379
minor cannabinoid or some other minor

401
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,839
compound that's kind of doing some heavy

402
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:33,838
lifting that we're just not seeing could

403
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,639
absolutely uh absolutely be there I

404
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
don't know exactly what it would be and

405
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,539
and again with every plant being so

406
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,939
different you know you'd love to find

407
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,679
this you know highly potent Miracle

408
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,440
molecule that's in there

409
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,179
um which may or may not exist but um it

410
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,420
would have been interesting to run it

411
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:53,578
with you know three isolates in that

412
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,198
same ratio and see if we get you know

413
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:56,758
this difference because of these minor

414
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,559
components there have been a couple

415
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,560
studies that suggest that the the

416
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,419
mixtures may increase bioavailability a

417
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,159
bit and that may be because some of

418
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:07,619
these other compounds are inhibiting sip

419
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,079
enzymes so there could be

420
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,318
it could be you know direct receptor

421
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,058
interaction or it could be you know

422
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,859
pharmacokinetic interaction that may add

423
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:18,539
to the benefit of a Botanical drug

424
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:22,259
substance

425
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:24,899
so how do these results compare to other

426
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,058
drugs or compounds that have been

427
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,220
studied for this application

428
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:33,000
there really haven't been many in the

429
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,279
Tau model we see this is fairly the the

430
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,019
early studies with CBD and CBG are

431
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,240
fairly consistent

432
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,859
um maybe not quite as beneficial as

433
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,200
metformin

434
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:46,379
um for those of you know who don't know

435
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,298
that Foreman's a drug commonly uh

436
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,419
prescribed for metabolic syndromes like

437
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:54,058
type 2 diabetes but there's um there's a

438
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,100
thought that it makes in life and

439
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,918
there's a couple different ways it may

440
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:01,798
do that but one of the ways is through

441
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,280
this methionine and folate synthesis so

442
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:07,980
it seems to inhibit those two compounds

443
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,619
which apparently is important for Life

444
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,960
Extension ironically those are two known

445
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:15,298
or at least methionine synthesis and

446
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,058
folate one carbon metabolism are two

447
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:21,720
mechanisms known for CBD so there may be

448
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:24,139
a mechanistic overlap with metformin and

449
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,480
again both compounds extended Life

450
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:30,720
resveratrol is another compound it's a a

451
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,880
solenoid so it has some similar

452
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,298
components as cannabinoids in terms of

453
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,880
like uh the the terpene structure within

454
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:39,720
that compound I'm also seen to extend

455
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,539
life

456
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,759
not as applicable in humans because of

457
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,319
metabolism in the gut so that's

458
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,119
something you know we have to be careful

459
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,399
with these models just because it

460
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,139
extends life in Clans you know what

461
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,600
happens when you put it in a system like

462
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,799
humans what happens with metabolism in

463
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,439
the gut

464
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:01,019
um and bioavailability so all critical

465
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,140
considerations to take into account but

466
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,700
generally speaking it looks as good as

467
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,980
many of the other compounds that we

468
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,298
think May extend life at least in this

469
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,700
model

470
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:13,679
excellent and so

471
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,779
so what is the next step I mean if you

472
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,240
start with c elegans um do you kind of

473
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,399
move up the chain of complexity there

474
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,558
and kind of test it well we could

475
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,059
certainly look at different uh compounds

476
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,639
but I think you know different

477
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:30,538
combinations and and different models of

478
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,440
C elegans but um given that Tau appears

479
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:37,079
to be you know a piece of the underlying

480
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,179
etiology of many different diseases

481
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:42,240
it may be important to look at some of

482
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,340
these so for example example maybe an

483
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,079
Alzheimer's dementia maybe you look at

484
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:48,659
rodent models for human models because

485
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,460
we saw some effect here maybe in maybe

486
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,058
this is one of the underlying mechanisms

487
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,860
for uh traumatic brain injury or stroke

488
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:59,058
or you know a number of other things

489
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:02,459
even cancer seems to have this

490
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:05,399
towel seems to be important and you know

491
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,100
having these Tau Tangles seem to affect

492
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,419
cellular energetics and Longevity on the

493
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:13,980
cellular level so preventing those or

494
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:16,380
acting as a protectant could be critical

495
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,419
in a variety of disease States

496
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,860
yeah and I guess that brings up a good

497
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,980
point too so

498
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:24,479
are we are we saying that these

499
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,640
compounds would be beneficial in

500
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,740
preventing these diseases from occurring

501
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,880
or treating them in folks that already

502
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,220
have them

503
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,140
or both no I think that's an excellent

504
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,779
point the truth is we don't know

505
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,299
obviously prevention would be ideal

506
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:42,538
although you know generally speaking our

507
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:44,279
our Health Care Systems not entirely

508
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:47,160
focused on prevention

509
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,918
um but what we could potentially do is

510
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,320
prevent worsening right if you let's say

511
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,900
it does let's say we do find out that it

512
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,058
is genuinely protective and helpful in

513
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,038
something like Alzheimer's

514
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:01,379
um you know can we give it early onset

515
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,440
you know what about other conditions

516
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,720
like Ms or Parkinson's that you know you

517
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,660
have this neurodegenerative kind of

518
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,940
disease can we give it early and prevent

519
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,259
uh progression which which again would

520
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,960
be the

521
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,839
the you know certainly beneficial to

522
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,600
that population and maybe not a cure but

523
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,339
uh you know it could it could help until

524
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,859
something else is potentially better

525
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:27,418
that that is a cure arrives

526
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:29,699
yet another thing that you had mentioned

527
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,740
too is that sort of the results you were

528
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,600
seeing was equivalent to like an 80 year

529
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:38,819
old human feeling like a 60 year old so

530
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,538
early before you are 80 or can an 80

531
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,538
year old um

532
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,158
you know even how well that would would

533
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:50,220
translate you know we're not really sure

534
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,500
but um you know based on the data it

535
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,960
would seem that taking for a period of

536
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,538
time probably similar to exercising your

537
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,659
whole life or dieting your whole life

538
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:03,058
may be of benefit to what degree that

539
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:05,580
benefit exists in humans I think is is

540
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:07,798
unknown but um it's interesting

541
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:10,500
nonetheless and it must be so difficult

542
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:11,700
to to determine that in a human too

543
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,220
because there's just so many different

544
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,200
factors that go with variables you know

545
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,839
these epidemiological studies around

546
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,120
diet and vitamins and nutrition just

547
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,339
incredibly difficult to do so many

548
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,979
compounding factors that make that data

549
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:28,199
very difficult to determine but um I

550
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,579
think the key point for the early

551
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,460
studies is that it doesn't appear to be

552
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:38,220
overtly toxic at these levels uh there

553
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,919
we do know in humans that there are some

554
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,759
potential dangers around liver toxicity

555
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:46,679
with high doses of CBD especially with

556
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,339
certain drugs like valproic acid which

557
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,900
is also known a known liver toxin so you

558
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,720
know I wouldn't say that you know high

559
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,340
doses for you know your whole life are

560
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,960
safe there could be some complications

561
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,298
there but

562
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,940
um at low Doses and medium doses it

563
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:04,980
doesn't appear to be a problem based on

564
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,960
exclusively on this model but that's a

565
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,500
you know it's a big leap to say the the

566
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,319
same for humans but so far so good if it

567
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,140
looked toxic then there would be a lot

568
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,759
more alarm Bells I know it is difficult

569
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,500
to make that leap even though I I keep

570
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,700
trying to make you I keep trying to make

571
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,099
you do it

572
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,019
um and and looking at the results and we

573
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:27,839
you talked about dosing it seemed like

574
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:29,400
there was sort of a sweet spot range for

575
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,798
the dose that really got the best effect

576
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,480
it wasn't necessarily the highest dose

577
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:34,440
they got the best effect so I was

578
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,500
wondering if you could speak a bit to

579
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,080
that sure I mean this is we saw it

580
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,720
across both studies and Botanical drug

581
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,058
extract and in isolate and towel model

582
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,220
and not towel model and then it's uh

583
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:49,440
it's not really surprising because we do

584
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,839
expect just about everything at a

585
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,240
certain level to have toxicity

586
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,759
um and and what we see actually CBG

587
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,579
appears to be less toxic in this model

588
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:01,919
than CBD milligram per milligram

589
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:05,158
um but but again you know you can

590
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,840
there's an ld50 for water so

591
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,020
um as you go up eventually something's

592
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:13,319
going to get toxic but I would also say

593
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:15,538
in terms of efficacy but this is

594
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,480
it's been a theory for some time about

595
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:20,879
this kind of inverted you or kind of

596
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,679
biphasic effects with cannabinoids I

597
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,600
think they're more profound with THC I

598
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,860
think there's a you know a narrow dose

599
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:30,839
window for THC uh we know that you know

600
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:32,819
low amounts uh or moderate amounts

601
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,918
increase appetite they may help with

602
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:37,379
anxiety they may help with sleep but

603
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,799
when you start giving really high doses

604
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,480
of THC you get massive paranoia nausea

605
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,158
and vomiting I mean it's not pretty

606
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,319
there are a bunch of hospitalizations

607
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,960
for people that you know didn't know how

608
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,759
much was in their brownie so you you

609
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,860
know as with

610
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,079
um these sorts of of physiological

611
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,839
effects you may see the same thing in

612
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,980
lifespan taking too much may be a

613
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,619
hindrance

614
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,900
um or or maybe neutral in terms of being

615
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:05,639
a benefit we still don't know kind of

616
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,100
where that sweet spot would be

617
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,538
especially as it relates to CBD and CBG

618
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:13,980
in humans

619
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:16,619
okay so can't necessarily apply the

620
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,360
dosage that was effective in C elegans

621
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,279
to humans like is there like a

622
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,019
conversion there that you could take

623
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:25,200
with in terms of what the dose would be

624
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:26,639
yeah there is a conversion um it's kind

625
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,019
of complicated how you do it in C

626
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,880
elegans there's two ways you could

627
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:31,259
actually look at the exposure you could

628
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,960
spin them down and look at their

629
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:36,538
exposure or you could use it as a

630
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,880
correlate with with other compounds that

631
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:39,960
have similar

632
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,880
lipophilicity so

633
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,120
um it is complicated but that 40

634
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,980
nanograms per ml or 40 nanograms of 40

635
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,739
micro molar excuse me

636
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,620
um is it's certainly a physiologically

637
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,419
relevant amount and not the same as you

638
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,219
know if if I was doing work in a dish

639
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,620
right because

640
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,558
they're basically eating the medium so

641
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:03,359
that's concentration and the their food

642
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:05,940
essentially so

643
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,278
um not necessarily their exposure on the

644
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:11,038
cell level so when you see you know

645
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:13,500
cancer studies oftentimes we're applying

646
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,619
that and that would be the cell exposure

647
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,019
this is kind of the food exposure which

648
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:20,879
is relevant to their internal exposure

649
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:22,980
after metabolism

650
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,600
okay and

651
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,220
apologize if you already answered this

652
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,259
question but

653
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,620
um so what do we think is going on here

654
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:33,419
like what mechanism is being applied to

655
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:36,000
kind of improve the health span and

656
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:38,520
lifespan of these C elegans do we really

657
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,058
know that yet or I don't I don't think

658
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:44,759
we know I mean there's you know CBD and

659
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:47,599
CBG are are let's say promiscuous

660
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:50,879
molecules in terms of uh mechanism

661
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:54,058
unlike a lot of new chemical entities

662
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,460
and synthesized drugs they're not really

663
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:58,200
you know designed to work on one

664
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,019
receptor type they're not highly

665
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:05,159
selective for one thing I mean we know

666
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:08,339
that CBD has at least 68 known targets

667
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:10,740
um and none of them are really potent

668
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:13,019
um THC is certainly more clear that it

669
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,720
works primarily as a partial Agonist at

670
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:18,298
CB1 but also has some other quote

671
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,538
unquote off-target effects know even

672
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:25,379
less about CBG I think it's difficult to

673
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:27,960
to determine it may be relevant to

674
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,960
Cellular energetics or mitochondria we

675
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,360
know there's some Focus potential

676
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,340
mechanisms there there's nucleotide

677
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:39,058
receptors that may be important for

678
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:40,980
transcription translation so truth is we

679
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:43,740
don't know there's tons of possibilities

680
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,599
so many that are are countless I could

681
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,839
probably spend the rest of my life

682
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,778
trying to determine which combination of

683
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:54,000
you know 100 different mechanisms right

684
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:56,880
or contributing

685
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,220
um but something's going on and you know

686
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,039
how can we apply it to potentially make

687
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,720
a medicine to help people is uh it would

688
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:06,119
be great to know that's the I think

689
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,620
that's the next step right well good job

690
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,439
security you got plenty of things to

691
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,719
investigate probably work on this the

692
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,179
rest of my life and might who knows

693
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,798
excellent all right

694
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:20,580
um so I'm gonna I'm gonna do it again

695
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,740
and I'm sorry but what is so

696
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm gonna I'm an otherwise healthy

697
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,880
person I I exercise I eat right I try to

698
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,278
take my vitamins and things like that so

699
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,278
can I should I

700
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:35,400
um incorporate CBD CBG into my routine

701
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:38,880
to potentially help uh my lifespan and

702
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:41,038
health span is it too early to tell or I

703
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,620
think it's I think it's still too early

704
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,900
I mean you certainly could do that I

705
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:48,239
things I would watch out for things like

706
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,980
drug drug interactions and you know

707
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,278
certain people with certain conditions

708
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,319
it may not be right for that individual

709
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,778
um and then also just knowing where to

710
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,960
get a quality thing that is labeled

711
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:02,579
appropriately also it can be expensive I

712
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,259
mean this is

713
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:07,079
um kind of diverging a little bit from

714
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:10,019
this conversation but these are fairly

715
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:12,480
High milligram Doses and and humans so

716
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,619
you know taking 10 milligrams of CBD in

717
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,400
a gummy

718
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:19,678
um may not be doing much if anything and

719
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,620
if you're willing to spend on you know

720
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,140
100 milligrams or hundreds of milligrams

721
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,699
per day it can get expensive I mean that

722
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,580
could be you know three four hundred

723
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,140
dollars a month and um then where do you

724
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:34,918
get it you know which company is the

725
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:37,440
most reputable that has CBD and CBG and

726
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,960
you know an idealistic ratio for for

727
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,058
health and I think that remains to be a

728
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,220
kind of industry-wide problem

729
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:45,418
wow is that is that the dosing level

730
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,480
that we're talking about here like

731
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:52,380
Uptown to hundreds of milligrams wow

732
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,980
yeah so not but who knows I mean we did

733
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:58,559
see effects at lower doses but um and

734
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:02,399
but yes it's probably not just 25

735
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,619
milligrams a day of CBD could be but um

736
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,839
you know we don't we don't really know

737
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:07,879
interesting all right well I'll hold off

738
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,500
then

739
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,120
maybe advisable maybe if nothing else

740
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,640
it'll probably save you some money

741
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,379
excellent all right Hunter Before I Let

742
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,020
You Go I want to give you a chance to

743
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,360
share any other resources um that might

744
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:22,679
be out there that folks could read up on

745
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,259
if they're interested in learning more

746
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,840
about this topic and uh then please also

747
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:29,640
plug any any ways that people can get in

748
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,859
touch with you and learn more about the

749
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,679
work that you're doing

750
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:36,418
um well unfortunately there aren't a lot

751
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,720
of resources in this area other than

752
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:41,940
maybe PubMed or Google Scholar we're

753
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,399
working to make more resources and you

754
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,038
know publish these data and we'll see

755
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:49,019
how it gets out to the general public

756
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:50,759
certainly you could attend can Med next

757
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:54,058
year and maybe there'll be some more

758
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:55,919
great presentations on these topics and

759
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:57,058
um we'll just keep going and if there

760
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,278
are any questions

761
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:02,038
