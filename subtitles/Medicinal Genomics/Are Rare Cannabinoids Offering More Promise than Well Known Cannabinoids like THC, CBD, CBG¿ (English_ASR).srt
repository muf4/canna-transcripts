2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,439
Now, is that a a common finding that

3
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,839
these rare canabonoids in the low

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,240
concentrations are find are offering

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:26,640
more promise perhaps than the ones we

6
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:31,439
know and love like THC, CBD, CBG?

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,640
So I will say the 50% in the cases.

8
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,200
Sometimes it's CBG, CBC, CBDV, the more

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,878
known ones. Yeah.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,920
But in half of the cases is the rare

11
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:43,878
cannabonoids. But I want to say

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,600
something, okay, which is

13
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:49,039
important. If you didn't see it and

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,760
never heard about it, doesn't mean that

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,920
it's rare, okay? Doesn't mean that it's

16
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,399
low concentration.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,800
So the the molecule that we saw that

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,799
killing the leukemia it's unknown

19
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:05,679
cannabonoids it's a new one whatever but

20
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:09,118
it's the third more expressed in this

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,080
strain so it was 2.3%

22
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,920
oh really it's not really minor it's not

23
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,438
really rare it's not low

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,840
percentage if the the the regular

25
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:23,039
equipment of or the HLC and we don't

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,320
have standard so we don't see it usually

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,640
doesn't mean that it's rare or or very

28
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:34,559
in low concentration. Okay. So, usually

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,200
these are not, you know, a a a very

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,439
extremely low concentration. It's not

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,079
0.001%. It will be

32
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,478
0.5%, 1%,

33
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:49,199
1.5%. But it's an

34
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:52,000
unknown molecule. So,

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,359
so it's a so it's sort of a limitation

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
of

37
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,718
Sorry for cutting you. If you look on

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,960
other plants, okay, even you know today

39
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,438
people talk about a lot of mushroom

40
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,599
functional mushrooms so mushroom if you

41
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,439
look on the concentration of the

42
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:14,878
molecule there which consider active it

43
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:17,680
will be 0.2% 0.5% 0.1%. Mhm. In cannabis

44
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:22,039
when you saying 0.3% you you think it's

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,760
it's rare or minor but if you

46
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:29,039
translate if if if if a patient using

47
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:32,000
one gram just for it will be easy to

48
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,598
calculate you know the average amount of

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,598
a patient in Israel it's

50
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:40,518
32.5 gram a month so it's an average of

51
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:45,878
one gram okay so

52
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:47,800
if if if a molecule is expressing

53
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:51,120
0.5% in

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,840
this flower. It will be 50 milligram a

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,480
day. 50 milligram it's drugable. 50

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,319
milligram it's it's it's not low amount

57
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:04,079
for a drug or a molecule to affect your

58
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:08,158
body. So it's not really rare or minor.

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,719
We are wrong to call them like that.

60
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,479
Interesting. So you're

61
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,959
saying with the testing labs or the

62
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,959
equipment or sort of the methods that

63
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,519
they're using, there could be these

64
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,360
unknown canabonoids that are are there

65
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,879
in concentrations, but they're just not

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,239
seeing it with the equipment or not

67
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:30,079
reporting it on the on the COA. I'm not

68
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,560
saying maybe we know that like it's

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,480
after 10 years I can tell you exactly.

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Yes, sure.

71
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:40,318
A lot of the cannabonoids which express

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,400
in quite high amount you don't see or

73
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,399
you don't

74
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,920
read. Usually the laboratories have the

75
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,840
ability to do that. But because it's not

76
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,878
interesting to anybody and it cost more

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,719
money it will cost instead of you know

78
00:03:52,878 --> 00:04:01,759
$50 or 40 $40 for for the test it will

79
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:03,158
cost $300. Usually the grower not asked

80
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,359
for these

81
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:08,239
readings and and usually the

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,200
laboratories not developed method to

83
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,239
look on them. Right? Every good

84
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:18,879
laboratory in the US that have masspec

85
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,918
or GCMS can take my paper read it and in

86
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:25,918
one day be able to see that. Okay. It's

87
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:29,120
not something that it's difficult.

88
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:34,439
there is no economic demand for that,

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,439
right? And and that's that's the reason

90
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:48,319
