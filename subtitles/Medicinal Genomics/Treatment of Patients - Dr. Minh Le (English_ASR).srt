1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:07,519
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,638
i'm going to be the opposite of kyle and

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,160
here here and i need to bring the

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,039
microphone down some

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,559
um so as brian said i was i'm a

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,799
pediatric neurologist i'm specialized in

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,719
epilepsy and neurogenetics specifically

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,920
some disclosures i am a consultant for

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,439
coordination and i'm

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,600
also going to talk about some off-label

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,399
treatment in epilepsy

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
so the point of my talk is to try to

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,959
bring

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,200
together the bring together the

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
topics of epilepsy cannabis and genetics

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
and how to

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,079
use the data together to see how we can

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,960
cater

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,558
the treatment courses for these patients

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
so i wanted to do a quick jump through

21
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,038
the brief history of epilepsy and

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,680
cannabis

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,280
hemp was first known as agricultural cop

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:53,039
crop in modern taiwan in 8000 bc

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,558
but the first recorded use of cannabis

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,359
as medicine occurred in china

27
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,399
about five millennias later and over

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,359
time

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,759
uh it spread from china out west east

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,198
north

31
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,879
south unfortunately um the oldest

32
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,679
reading recording of epilepsy was in

33
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,359
ancient mesopotamia in 2000 bc but it

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
was viewed as a psychiatric disorder

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,200
possessed by demons type of thing

36
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,719
as you can see some of these drawings

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,520
and the treatment was not very good

38
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,560
going anywhere from leaching to burr

39
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,158
hose in the skull

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,600
so not exactly the most pleasant of

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,040
treatments

42
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,839
unfortunately we have progressed

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,759
starting in 500 bc thanks to hippocrates

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,359
who defined epilepsy as a medical

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,200
condition as opposed to a psychiatric

46
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,200
condition

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,240
and a greek physician galen a few

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
centuries later

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,359
started prescribing medical marijuana in

50
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,280
general not specifically for epilepsy

51
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,200
um going into modern times dr william

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,478
o'shonasi introduced medical marijuana

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,759
to western medicine including the

54
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,039
treatment of epilepsy so that was the

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,719
first recorded history

56
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
of medical marijuana being used for

57
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,959
epilepsy

58
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,759
um in 1850 bromide was the first

59
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,759
effective

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,959
anti-seizure medication by that was

61
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,680
introduced by sir

62
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,759
charles locka and since then uh we have

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
had many more seizure medications

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,920
introduced um to the point where we're

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
over 30 seizure medications now

66
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,719
including

67
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,639
1910 when phenobarbital was introduced

68
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,479
as the first synthetic compound

69
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,479
with the most recent being aption

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
so cannabis was added to the u.s

71
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:24,239
pharmacopoeia in 1850 as well but

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
unfortunately in 1914 the harrison act

73
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,360
defined marijuana as a crime and

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,000
subsequently following

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,879
california coincidentally was the first

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,080
state to

77
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,159
illegalize marijuana um

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,519
then dr rafael mccutchulin who we've had

79
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,560
the honor of listening to

80
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,159
um started researching um

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
medical marijuana and was started

82
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,199
isolating and synthesizing delta nine

83
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,359
thc

84
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,280
um and then in 1970 the controlled

85
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
substance act classified marijuana as

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,840
schedule 1

87
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
which basically illegalized it

88
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
nationwide

89
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,239
and that's where the problem started

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
marinol

91
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,719
did become fda approved in 1985 so that

92
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
started opening up some doors again

93
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,959
and then the cannabis receptors cb1

94
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,000
specifically was discovered in 1988 by

95
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,560
doctors howlett and devane

96
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
coincidentally in 1996 california became

97
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,680
the first state to re-legalize marijuana

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,120
and then the whole modern progression of

99
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,760
marijuana started medical marijuana

100
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,480
started in august 2000 2013 when sanjay

101
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,560
gupta

102
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,919
endorsed the product on cnn program

103
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,158
called weeds and highlighted the story

104
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,919
of charlotte figue

105
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,519
and gw started their trials soon

106
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,839
thereafter

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,039
so is epilepsy treatable i'm saying

108
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,439
treatable because most of the time it's

109
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,439
not curable we're basically putting

110
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,439
a band-aid on a symptom because seizures

111
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,560
are a symptom of the epilepsy which is

112
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,158
the disorder

113
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,598
as you see here this is a well-known

114
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,120
study from 2000 from

115
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,719
dr brody and for the first medication

116
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,719
works okay about 50 percent of

117
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,239
seizure patients become seizure-free but

118
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,359
as you get to the second and third drug

119
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
it's getting worse and worse to the

120
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,599
point where

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
the chance that when you're on the third

122
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,639
drug or higher it's only about a three

123
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,120
percent chance that you're going to

124
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,039
become seizures free so not very good

125
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,640
so about a third of patients remain what

126
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,798
we call intractable meaning failing two

127
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,479
or more seizure medications

128
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,080
so i think the best way to highlight all

129
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,759
this topic

130
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
is to go through some case presentations

131
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,159
and i have some videos that are slightly

132
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,079
graphic

133
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,000
um i try to choose more of the benign

134
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,720
ones but i think it really brings home

135
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
the point about

136
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,919
what these parents and these families

137
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,600
have to deal with um so

138
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,279
the first patient is mk she presented to

139
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,439
me at 11 years of age

140
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,279
her seizure started at six months with

141
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,560
of high fever after vaccinations

142
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,279
and then she had started having seizures

143
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,120
without fever at her initial evaluation

144
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,198
with me she had multiple seizure types

145
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
tried on multiple seizure medications

146
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,080
including oxycobazipine and lamotrigine

147
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,560
both are sodium channel mechanisms

148
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,159
um the ox cabazipima trilepto made her

149
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,478
seizures worse but then lamotrigine did

150
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,840
not which she's currently on as well

151
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,439
development was normal until about a

152
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,359
year and then she was subsequently

153
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,639
diagnosed with autism and was basically

154
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,160
non-verbal

155
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
and workup was essentially negative

156
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,560
including basic genetic workup and eeg

157
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,000
and mri changes that were non-specific

158
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
so i knew the diagnosis right away

159
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,399
hearing the story so i asked cordagen

160
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,240
to send the epilepsy next generation

161
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,478
sequencing panel she did come back with

162
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,918
a scn-1a de novo mutation meaning she

163
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,719
has dravet syndrome she fits that

164
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,319
phenotype

165
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,919
i asked them to rush it because the

166
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,279
epidiolex trials were just about to

167
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,478
close and i was running the trials in

168
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,559
orlando at that time

169
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,079
so i was able to get her in quickly the

170
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
importance of this mutation is that you

171
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,199
have to avoid sodium channel blocking

172
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,720
agents because it's a loss of function

173
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,478
mutation

174
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,080
in general though in the subset of

175
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,758
populations for some reason we don't

176
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,599
know yet and then we have to kind of

177
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,038
sort this out is they don't respond

178
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,039
adversely to sodium channel

179
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,319
agents but in in general you want to

180
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,399
avoid them because it can bring them

181
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,839
into status epilepticus

182
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,918
but she was placed in the epidiolex

183
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,918
child she had an immediate 50

184
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,839
seizure reduction eg showed background

185
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,159
improvement which is

186
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,119
unusual to actually get a change in the

187
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,639
background itself

188
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,399
and she was talking much more and had

189
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,759
much more improved eye contact

190
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,239
as an additional example i have another

191
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,800
patient exactly the same story

192
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,918
diagnosed before i saw her put in the

193
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
epidiolex child

194
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,918
she was non-verbal she was eating poorly

195
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
from day one we administered the

196
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,519
epidialex

197
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,399
as the mom was driving home she all of a

198
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,639
sudden spat out

199
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,038
mom i want food mom basically slammed on

200
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,800
the brakes and said okay

201
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,079
the first visit that she came back to me

202
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,520
i was also floyd she was

203
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,879
playing on her ipad which she was doing

204
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,159
before but i was seeing what she was

205
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,839
doing and she was actually spelling

206
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,280
words on the ipad which

207
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,679
completely floored me um dr davinski

208
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,879
kind of

209
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,038
went through this data already so i'll

210
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,719
just go look at it briefly as you see

211
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:35,439
here they did section out the dravet

212
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
syndrome

213
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,800
patients and they did have a better

214
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
response so there's a certain

215
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,960
subset of populations that is going to

216
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,479
respond better to the epidiolex

217
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,120
and these were the phase three datas

218
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,879
that dr davinsky already went through

219
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,639
so ja is another patient of mine he

220
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,639
presented to me at three years of age

221
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,598
with explosive onset of myoclonic

222
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,519
seizures so

223
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,360
basically jerking type of seizures he

224
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,879
also started having drop seizures atonic

225
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,000
seizures as well as generalized tonic

226
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,918
clonic seizures

227
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and i kindly diagnosed him with dozer

228
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,038
syndrome um with dozer syndrome there's

229
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,120
no good treatment for it

230
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,399
some people say ketogenic diet some say

231
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,439
very good nerve stimulator but there's

232
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,598
no good treatment

233
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,560
he was having seizures so often by the

234
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,478
time

235
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,160
we tried him on certain medications he

236
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,758
was having seizures every seven to ten

237
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,560
seconds so imagine your life like that

238
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,800
there's no way

239
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,240
a child's brain can develop that way he

240
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,759
was tried on multiple medications

241
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,280
including ketogenic diet

242
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,800
he completely regressed he could not

243
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,079
walk he could not talk anymore he

244
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,919
couldn't even eat anymore

245
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,519
and his work up was basically negative

246
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,680
as well

247
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,159
so i wanted to show you a video of his

248
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
seizures

249
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,279
maybe

250
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,038
um maybe not okay um but basically as

251
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,799
you see his background eg's

252
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,120
very messy all those big generalized

253
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
spikes um he basically just

254
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,918
dropped or jerked every seven to ten

255
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,759
seconds and then he had those big

256
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,439
seizures as well

257
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,960
at this point i really had no more

258
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,639
options for this family i said well we

259
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,079
can try the vagal nerve stimulator but

260
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,360
the data is not very good on that as

261
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,000
well

262
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,280
i did send for genetic testing and he

263
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,918
had

264
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,279
two mutations come up one was a chd2

265
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,639
mutation which in the literature

266
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,239
had just been reported at a time

267
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,360
associated with severe myoclonic

268
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680
epilepsy as well

269
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,038
however it was materially inherited so i

270
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,319
wasn't sure if that was the complete

271
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,279
answer but i kind of went with that

272
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,319
diagnosis

273
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,159
for the time being and mom was

274
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,680
asymptomatic so i wasn't sure

275
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,000
he also had a second mutation the

276
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,519
calcium channel cachna1a

277
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,879
which at that time i didn't believe

278
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,639
explained his symptoms because it's only

279
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,559
been reported with familial hemiplegic

280
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,958
migraine and episodic ataxia at that

281
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,478
time

282
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,000
but it was de novo meaning neither

283
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,800
parents passed on and so that was a

284
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,240
little unusual so i kept an eye on that

285
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,240
but so what we uh last year

286
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,839
uh this past december though there was a

287
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
few case reports with cachna 1a

288
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,160
associated with severe myoclonic

289
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,920
epilepsy so

290
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,838
i did talk to the parents about that but

291
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,958
i gave the parents the blessing they

292
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,959
they said that we want to move to

293
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,879
colorado and try cbd i said go because i

294
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,719
wasn't legalized in florida yet

295
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,399
and he after playing with a few

296
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,920
different strains few uh different

297
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,360
dosing we finally got him down to about

298
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,399
two to three seizures day remember this

299
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
kid was having

300
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,919
seizures every seven to ten seconds so

301
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,639
that was a huge improvement

302
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,240
um basically the when one of the emails

303
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,639
the family sent me was just basically

304
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
he's

305
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,000
they said he is back our little kid is

306
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,519
back he was

307
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,120
walking he was talking again he's

308
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,759
participating in regular classroom

309
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,839
settings

310
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,679
he's not quite normal but he's at least

311
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,279
you know being able to be integrated

312
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,319
into a regular classroom and he's eating

313
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,120
again

314
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,399
so this is him and as you see uh he's he

315
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,320
looks quite normal you would not

316
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,519
have known like a few months ago he was

317
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,040
having seizures every

318
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,639
seven to ten seconds so the

319
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,240
calcium channel mutation is interesting

320
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,199
because it works on the p and q type

321
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
calcium channels

322
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
now we don't have any seizure

323
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,519
medications that work on those channels

324
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,800
but we do have a blood pressure

325
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,600
medication that works on it called

326
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,719
verapamil

327
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
and that's the thing i'm going to try

328
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,440
them on next because i'm never happy

329
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,278
until the child's seizure free

330
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,959
so we're going to try this on the child

331
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,559
next um we actually have used for apple

332
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,239
meal in seizures before in the gervais

333
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,838
patient population and it has helped a

334
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
subset of those kids as well

335
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,600
so i'm excited to kind of see what

336
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,079
happens with him

337
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,240
um ec he's a six-year-old global delays

338
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,239
noted typical story bad

339
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,639
motor delays in speech became non-verbal

340
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,000
diagnosed with autism he started having

341
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,519
seizures

342
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,799
diagnosed at three and a half may sleep

343
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,000
mostly tonic seizures where you get

344
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,240
stiff all over

345
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,919
he had multiple um he's been on multiple

346
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,039
seizure medications basically he's tried

347
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,799
everything under the book

348
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,838
and he was having about 40 plus seizures

349
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,838
a day as well

350
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,799
yeah yeah the first video didn't have

351
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,799
that for some reason

352
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,039
so as you see here interactively meaning

353
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,159
between seizures he usually has a bunch

354
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,679
of spikes you don't see there but he

355
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,278
just has some background slowing

356
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,599
and then what he does is he drops and

357
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,120
then he cuts stiff and his background

358
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,120
just flattens and that's a typical

359
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,720
atonic tonic type of seizure

360
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,959
and remember he was having about 40 of

361
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,680
these a day

362
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,119
and just imagine for a kid that is uh

363
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,479
ambulatory this is not good because

364
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,679
they're falling constantly they'll have

365
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,200
to use a wheelchair they have to

366
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,559
wear a helmet he also had these episodes

367
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,320
of dystonia which

368
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,879
the previous neurologist kind of treated

369
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,800
him with baclofen it worked okay

370
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,320
since infancy also he had a lot of gi

371
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,919
issues cyclic vomiting

372
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
alternating constipation diarrhea

373
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,120
problems with weight gain

374
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,720
and also a lot of behavioral issues very

375
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,600
hyper very aggressive and that was

376
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,120
actually the main

377
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,278
concerns outside of seizures for the

378
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,639
parents um workup was basically normal

379
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,720
the microarray showed a

380
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,720
chromosomal deletion that i didn't felt

381
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,399
um fit the picture so i ignored that

382
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,759
so i also sent the epilepsy pattern on

383
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,958
him he came back to me with two

384
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,278
mutations as well

385
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,039
one is in the scn2a a sodium channel

386
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,958
just like sn1a but these

387
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,639
mutations are different because they're

388
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,239
gain of function mutations as opposed to

389
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,240
loss of function mutations

390
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,159
it was the novel so it wasn't inherited

391
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,600
by either family but i couldn't

392
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,039
so i couldn't completely toss it out but

393
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,759
he doesn't really present with like that

394
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,838
that most of the

395
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,958
all the scn2a kids present with seizures

396
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,399
under a year of age so unless the

397
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,838
parents completely missed it

398
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,360
um he doesn't quite fit that but i

399
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,480
wanted to keep that in my back pocket

400
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,800
the reason for that is

401
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,480
if he failed the treatment that we had

402
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,039
for him that i would put them on very

403
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
high dose sodium channel agents even

404
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,919
then in the literature those

405
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,760
that high dose doesn't get them

406
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,278
seizure-free but at least it helps them

407
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,039
but more importantly and this is a

408
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,360
diagnosis i thought about with him is he

409
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,799
had a

410
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,200
solute six eight a mutation

411
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,838
which is linked to x-linked creatine

412
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,680
transport

413
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
deficiency and this was inherited

414
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,559
through the mom

415
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,720
this is very important because as

416
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,078
opposed to creatine deficiency disorders

417
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,680
they don't respond as well

418
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,278
to the supplements um i did think about

419
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,759
these things um however

420
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,600
when a local lab gets an um order like

421
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,799
guanadino acetate they kind of freak out

422
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,000
and have no idea what they're ordering

423
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,958
and just order something else so i kept

424
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,480
getting the wrong thing so

425
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,838
i actually got these metabolic markers

426
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,360
four and a half months after i got his

427
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
genetic diagnosis and they were abnormal

428
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,959
they called me

429
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,159
and i said yeah yeah i already know okay

430
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,078
so on the left here is

431
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,919
mrs as you see this is the choline

432
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,759
creatine peak and that's what's normal

433
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,360
and this is the patient's as you see his

434
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,159
choline peak is much lower than what it

435
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,159
should be

436
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,078
his creatine peak is much lower than it

437
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,000
should be but this was important

438
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,078
information for me because it tells me

439
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,480
that he has some creatine going into his

440
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,799
brain

441
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,240
so there is some transporter function so

442
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,199
i said go ahead let's go ahead and try

443
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,639
this supplements

444
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,720
we put him on the supplements and he's

445
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,759
been seizure-free since his gi issues we

446
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,759
completely resolved

447
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,200
his improved energy his eg basically

448
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,559
normalized he has a few spikes here and

449
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,160
there but not like the bad eeg

450
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,199
background that i was seeing before

451
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,199
i repeated his mrs as well and there was

452
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,879
a 50 increase in creatine but

453
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,639
i couldn't go higher on his supplements

454
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,759
because if i go higher on his creatine

455
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,399
basically i

456
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,759
destroy his kidneys he however did not

457
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,480
have any improvements on cognition of

458
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,559
behavior

459
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,159
so the parents wanted to try cbd oil

460
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,599
unfortunately we did try that and he's

461
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,360
had no improvement but i was limited in

462
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,399
florida as well about what ratios i

463
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
could use

464
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,720
so as the laws open up hopefully they'll

465
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,159
be able to try other things

466
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,839
and the next thing would be try those

467
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,600
high dose sodium channel agents

468
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,760
but more importantly there is a clinical

469
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,120
trial in process with a creatine analog

470
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,159
specifically for these creatine

471
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,000
transported so

472
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,759
there will be no delays and diagnosis

473
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,120
with him once that trial opens i can

474
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,958
enroll him right away

475
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,879
and the mom was inherited because any

476
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,638
future boy she has that has a 50

477
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:21,120
risk of having this disorder

478
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,079
tc now is a five month old male he

479
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,600
presented at with

480
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,239
these episodes of behavioral arrest and

481
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,959
losing tone for 30-60 seconds which only

482
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,120
occurred during when he was sick

483
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,319
otherwise neurologically he was intact

484
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
in between episodes

485
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,760
and these were his episodes the eg

486
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,958
background is very normal

487
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,559
this is during one of his illnesses

488
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,000
and as you see he has good enough

489
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,518
strength to palm up but then he starts

490
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,919
getting wobbly

491
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,759
and then eventually he'll fall over and

492
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,759
he has a starter response not a seizure

493
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,920
and he just flops over the eg was normal

494
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,360
but the parents really wanted to know

495
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,559
what was going on and i didn't have an

496
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,519
answer for them but i said this sounds

497
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,278
like an energy

498
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,799
metabolism problem so i said let's send

499
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,639
for mitochondrial

500
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,719
unfortunately we did because it came

501
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,240
back and he had a solute 2a1 mutation

502
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,360
which enclosed for glucose transporter

503
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,959
one deficiency

504
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,159
so this kid got diagnosed at eight

505
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,759
months of age which is one of the

506
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,519
earliest ever for glucose transporter

507
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,360
one and it was the novo mutation once

508
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,759
again

509
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,440
coincidentally though they sent me this

510
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,919
video the same day i got the

511
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,519
genetic report back with these new

512
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,439
episodes

513
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,360
and basically he just has what we call

514
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,079
oral automatisms mouth smacking lip

515
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,600
smacking

516
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,120
and he kind of stares off so this could

517
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,800
be one of two types of seizures focal

518
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,720
seizures or absence seizures

519
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,919
but absent seizures really don't exist

520
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,079
in this age group

521
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,399
eight months of age with the exception

522
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,799
of glucose transporter one deficiency

523
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,039
so i got the diagnosis early before he

524
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,519
really became truly symptomatic um his

525
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,759
eg

526
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,720
consistent with absence seizures i

527
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,480
tapped him uh

528
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,560
and his glucose and ratios were low in

529
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,320
the csf it's immediately started on the

530
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,638
ketogenic diet and he's been free

531
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,320
seizure-free since um and has no

532
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,839
problems with his developmental

533
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,680
um he can also be enrolled in the

534
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,440
trihephthalon trial if he decides in the

535
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,758
future he doesn't want to do the nasty

536
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,240
ketogenic diet

537
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,680
but this is important because most of

538
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,039
these children don't get diagnosed late

539
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,879
in life i have several kids who come to

540
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,480
me at eight nine years old or older

541
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,000
they have these severe epilepsies global

542
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,039
delays movement disorders which is the

543
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,879
typical triad

544
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,319
of group one and by that time their

545
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,120
brains already destroyed and

546
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,759
irreversibly bleed damage so they're

547
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,198
they're

548
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,039
placed on the ketogenic diet the

549
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,879
seizures may improve but

550
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,879
their cognitive abilities don't improve

551
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,600
so would this be a case where

552
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,759
cbd oil may come into play and help

553
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
these children

554
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,039
is cannabis a reasonable option for

555
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,480
treating procedures we do know it has

556
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,278
anti-epileptic properties

557
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,480
it probably has has anti-inflammatory

558
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,838
properties that are also helping these

559
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
kids because these kids are seizing all

560
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,639
the time

561
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,839
their brains become damaged and

562
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,360
endemicus

563
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:03,040
so these anti-inflammatory problems will

564
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,160
help with that this is a map from

565
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,599
2006 in 2007 where these are the states

566
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,439
that were legalized we've progressed a

567
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,279
lot since then this is the current map

568
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,640
including georgia and virginia that were

569
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,119
just approved late last year and then

570
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,280
pennsylvania which will also be

571
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,279
pushing a bill through as well so what

572
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,240
do we know it's not a panacea

573
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,959
nothing is okay at least one strain is

574
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,199
not going to solve

575
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,038
every disorder and unfortunately this we

576
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,759
can't just have one drug company test

577
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,160
for

578
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,319
one ratio on one type of patient that

579
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,558
will take forever to figure this out

580
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,079
cbd is non-euphoric and non-addictive it

581
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,399
can be effective for many diseases

582
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,399
including many neurological disorders

583
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,480
side effects and ure spasticity

584
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,000
epidiolex for gervais syndrome

585
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,480
it is safe at least in the short-term

586
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,679
data but what other diseases can it be

587
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
effective for

588
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,280
we have a lot of anecdotal data and

589
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,880
small case series but very little

590
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,279
randomized double-blinded

591
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,640
placebo-controlled studies what is the

592
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,160
specific mechanism

593
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,000
and what compounds are needed there's a

594
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,720
lot of different compounds to cbd as you

595
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,679
see in the in the cbd pathway

596
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,279
microcannabinoids terpenes and so forth

597
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,960
different diseases will need different

598
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,759
ratios we do know need we

599
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,759
do know that and it's how much thc is

600
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,279
effective because we do know thc is also

601
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,000
pro-convulsive meaning it can cause

602
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,918
seizures

603
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,839
and what is the long-term safety data on

604
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,240
this compound

605
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,519
we still need a lot of studies so i just

606
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,599
wanted to end with a quote

607
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,279
by hippocrates himself people think that

608
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,519
epilepsy is divine simply because they

609
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,119
don't have any idea what causes epilepsy

610
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,879
but i believe that someday we will

611
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,399
understand what causes epilepsy and at

612
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
that moment we will cease to believe

613
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,880
that it's divine

614
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,120
and so it is with everything in the

615
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,440
universe and that's the case today

616
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,678
as we're finding the genetic etiologies

617
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,120
of epilepsies and can kind of cater the

618
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,080
treatment course

619
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,839
of these patients um it can affect the

620
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,798
outcome as with the glucose transporter

621
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,720
one

622
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:55,038
that diagnosis or basically save this

623
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,798
child's life and development

624
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,720
and then genetic testing can be helpful

625
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,079
as far as guiding if another treatment

626
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,919
is appropriate so for example that

627
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,359
glucose transporter one deficiency

628
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,799
you want to treat with ketogenic diet

629
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,199
first you don't want to play it out with

630
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,759
medical marijuana but we have kids that

631
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,440
has a cdk l5 mutation where we know

632
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,038
nothing works on these kids so why

633
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,080
mess around and wait instead of just

634
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,200
going directly to cbd and testing that

635
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,599
looking at responders versus

636
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,600
non-responders based on the metabolism

637
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,279
and the pathways as well as allowing

638
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,038
phenotyping of the compound to determine

639
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:38,399
contaminants

640
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:38,400
okay thank you for your time
