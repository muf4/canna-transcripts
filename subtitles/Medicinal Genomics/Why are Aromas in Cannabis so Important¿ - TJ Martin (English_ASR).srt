[Music]

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,278
why Aromas are so important to cannabis

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:20,278
and why they're important to you and

4
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:23,160
your team at

5
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,278
abstracts yeah so cannabis Aroma is

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,518
really I mean they're really responsible

7
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,278
for driving that consumer experience so

8
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:33,920
when consumers are purchasing whether

9
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:36,119
that be concentrates vape pens flower

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,480
pre-rolls um they may be buying these

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,878
based on how they like how it smells and

12
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,279
tastes right and to understand more

13
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,079
about why it smells the way it does and

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,480
tastes the way it does we want to

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,960
understand more about the chemistry

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,519
behind these Aromas and the

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,799
understanding this research is really

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,520
important to us as a company because we

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,718
have an extraction facility um obviously

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,280
we create flavor and turfing blends for

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,800
various customers but also just really

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,920
were curious to see like why does I mean

23
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:09,719
we understand why OG smell skunky and

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,359
gassy but why now do GMOs smell garlicky

25
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:16,920
and savory why do Zid and runts and all

26
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,560
the other Exotics tangies smell fruity

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,519
tropical gassy oranges like where are

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,000
all these smells and Ras coming from and

29
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,759
can we start correlating the chemistry

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,879
to the human sensory aspect because and

31
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,478
as a company when we start we working on

32
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,158
this for about two three years now um

33
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:36,840
before he published it but really was

34
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,280
around like I think November 2022 we

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,200
started seeing regulatories um agencies

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,519
come out with new regulations stating

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,680
that cannabis was not fruity or sweet or

38
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,599
um Savory right we've seen this in

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,320
California and this isn't this isn't

40
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,039
anything malicious right this is just

41
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,438
because there was no data and

42
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,399
information showing that out in the

43
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,359
marketplace testing Labs couldn't really

44
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,439
test for it and there was no public and

45
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,840
so we knew we had all this data inous we

46
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:05,199
working towards this publication like

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,600
hey we really need to tell the story

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,520
right and show people that hey there is

49
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,120
more to the plant then we may understand

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,280
at this time that we know why it smells

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,239
and tastes grapey right why does GDP

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,159
have that grape note why does Blackberry

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,200
Kush have those dark berry notes we

54
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,400
understand the chemistries behind this

55
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,238
and this is empowering um important

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,959
powerful information not only for

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,719
Regulators people doing cultivation

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,598
genetic like breed genetic breeding um

59
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,120
extraction the whole Gambit of the

60
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:37,518
industry could benefit from having this

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,640
information because then you can

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,959
utilizes to better improv products and

63
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,958
consumer experiences and when you look

64
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,239
at Publications like Addie Ray and Ethan

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,319
Russo's publication they're looking at

66
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,719
they show that the consumer experience

67
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,280
it how much how good that experience is

68
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,680
for the consumer how positive it is was

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,878
correlated to how positive they perceive

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,159
the aroma to be right so understand

71
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,239
understanding more of this is going to

72
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:06,639
help give better experiences to not only

73
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,200
existing consumers but new entry

74
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,518
consumers coming into the industry who

75
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,598
may be interested to try

76
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,480
cannabis excellent yeah I'm glad you

77
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:18,039
brought up Edie Ray and her um her study

78
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,518
there she was a guest on the podcast

79
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,840
I'll put a link to that one too people

80
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,400
can really go down the rabbit hole um

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,759
but yeah that was really interesting

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,438
where yeah she would have folks on the

83
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:32,919
study smell different types of cannabis

84
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:35,000
and how how how good they thought they

85
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,559
smelled and then actually consume it and

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,878
kind of rate their experience and saw a

87
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,878
correlation where if you like the way it

88
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,679
smelled you tended to like the

89
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,719
experience which was pretty pretty

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,879
powerful 100% right I mean it it just

91
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,359
going to show that understanding more

92
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,000
about why it smells and tastes the way

93
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,280
it does is super important for whole

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,759
wide ranging um different product types

95
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,759
and our understanding of this industry

96
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,798
and trying to again empower consum

97
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,919
consumers to make more educated

98
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,239
decisions and get better experience of

99
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,000
the products right I mean a lot of

100
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,319
people who've been either in the

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,959
industry or consumed cannabis a lot of

102
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,518
people have bad experiences and bad

103
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
stories right maybe if we have more

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,639
education and more understanding of

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,759
what's going on we can avoid those

106
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,759
circumstances and those those bad

107
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:31,719

108
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
experiences

109
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:36,478
a
