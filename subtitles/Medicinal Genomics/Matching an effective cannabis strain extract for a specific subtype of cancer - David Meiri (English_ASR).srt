1
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:09,449
thank you for inviting me here to speak

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,580
my name is David Mary I'm not a

3
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:13,649
physician I'm a scientist I have a

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,109
laboratory in the Technion which is

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,660
similar to the MIT it's a Technology

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,390
Institute of Israel I wish it was

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,460
similar to the MIT it's a little bit

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:29,730
smaller and my background is biology and

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,359
my Master's is in biochemistry I did a

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,850
PhD in plant biology and by kind of a

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,700
mistake I did my postdoc in Toronto in

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,439
cancer biology when I came back to

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,980
Israel and got my own lab I got a

14
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:55,670
laboratory for cancer research my

15
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:55,669
presentation sorry yeah let's not get

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,020
somewhere

17
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:07,390
okay I will keep without my presentation

18
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:10,810
so when I got my rabbit her and I

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:13,719
started one of the papers that I I saw

20
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:17,680
that quote one of my work in mypos dog

21
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:20,829
show that treating breast cancer with

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,500
cannabis can block the ability of these

23
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:26,228
cells to migrate to create metastasis

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,478
and this is what something that I did in

25
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:32,618
my postdoc and look very interesting to

26
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:34,950
me and I want to keep going with it so

27
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:37,539
this is the papers and I will go on and

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,460
when I started to read about cannabis

29
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:42,549
and cancer I saw that there are few

30
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,769
papers that showing the treating cancer

31
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:46,959
with cannabis can create apoptosis to

32
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:49,329
these cells and apoptosis is like when

33
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,759
cells committing suicide every cell in

34
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:53,978
our body have a machinery that we check

35
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,379
itself all the time there is checkpoint

36
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:59,649
and something is wrong he is committing

37
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:01,030
suicide and cancer cancer and it's a

38
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:04,030
given name to hundreds of different

39
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,189
diseases but we put them in all the same

40
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,840
box and we said every time that we see

41
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:10,359
all this phenomena we will call it

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,489
cancer and the first phenomena is that

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,520
the cell can avoid apoptosis that it

44
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:17,259
avoid this committing suicide and then

45
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,140
they are standing there and become more

46
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:23,348
involvement so as a scientist as a

47
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:26,469
researcher for cancer you want to have

48
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:29,859
the ability to bring back these

49
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:32,590
phenomena this killing that they will

50
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,599
kill themselves and that would why so so

51
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,330
the first question when we approach this

52
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:40,568
question with this work we asked which

53
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,819
type of cancer so we saw that in breast

54
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:44,768
cancer there is publication we thought

55
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:47,609
that in glioblastoma death publication

56
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:49,870
but what about other cancer there are

57
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,560
hundreds of different types of cancer

58
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:57,459
and second what the hell is cannabis so

59
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,009
so cannabis it's a plant and as I said I

60
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:02,709
in plant biologist I know that if you

61
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:05,139
grow a plant if you pick a plant in

62
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:07,030
different time of the day have Sun of

63
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:08,949
Agriculture if you pick strawberries in

64
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,289
the morning or afternoon they have a

65
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:12,908
different taste okay they're sweeter in

66
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:14,409
the afternoon I will tell you a secret

67
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:18,409
okay

68
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:21,139
but because they're doing photosynthesis

69
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:22,879
and whatever but it's the same thing for

70
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:24,769
cannabis what is cannabis so we know

71
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,229
that there is at Eva indica I would

72
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,030
realize we know types of cannabis it's

73
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:31,039
the different soils that you grow them

74
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,060
that will be different in Israel we have

75
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:38,150
91 different strains that the care is

76
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,069
that the patient can face and every

77
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,469
strain it's like a different medicine so

78
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,209
which kind of cannabis what I what we

79
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:47,060
should do so how we approach it

80
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,920
we're taking cell so I went to one of my

81
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,979
students I told her okay let's try to

82
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,109
see where are we standing let's try to

83
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:58,250
repeat the experiment that these guys

84
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:00,110
did and see where are we where what is

85
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,780
the point we want to start so we took

86
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,750
six different types of cannabis

87
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,180
different types of plants and we make

88
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,250
six different types of extract and we

89
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,409
choose eight different types of cancer

90
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,719
that where they we have in our lab okay

91
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,979
so we are growing in the cell and the

92
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,089
cells growing on the plate like that

93
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:21,980
it's it's they're going like confluent

94
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:24,229
on the cells the cells look like that if

95
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,270
you're taking a picture if you look in

96
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,490
the microscope cells look like that this

97
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:30,979
is one cell and we're growing the cells

98
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,730
and now we are treating with cannabis so

99
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:39,020
if we look on on colon cancer you see

100
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:41,360
the structure now it's a lower

101
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:43,310
magnification you just see like a

102
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,680
structure of the cells growing on the

103
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,740
plate nicely weird extract number one

104
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,230
all the cell died we add next extract

105
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,379
number two all the cell died we add

106
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:57,379
extract number three nothing happened to

107
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:59,478
the cells so first I see distinguish I

108
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,459
see I see differences between different

109
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:04,159
types of cannabis which was quite

110
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:07,699
exciting and another thing we Pia we put

111
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,120
really low amount of extract so we put

112
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:13,909
one microgram per ml so if you taking

113
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,370
rose marine and you extract the oil from

114
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,260
rosemary and you put on cancer cells

115
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,180
then we die but if you're doing

116
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:22,550
extrapolation how much you need to eat

117
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,879
you need to eat 20 kilogram per day okay

118
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,889
not interesting okay but if you look if

119
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,159
you're doing extrapolation of what you

120
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:30,620
need

121
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,140
to take versus cannabis you reaching one

122
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,750
gram which never just show you this it's

123
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:37,430
one joint so it's fine when we are in

124
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,490
the good scale and if you compare it to

125
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,889
those that when we put chemotherapy like

126
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,930
tax or vincristine vinblastine it's the

127
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,419
same thing because the active compound

128
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,019
here are nano gram so this was very

129
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,750
exciting this is a very important

130
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:57,529
material so we look on the breast cancer

131
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,240
and we see the exam results extras

132
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,969
number one and to kill the cells and the

133
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,759
extra Nami d3 did nothing we look on

134
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,590
trusted cancer and now we see different

135
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,480
that extract number one did nothing to

136
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:11,629
the cell extract number two did nothing

137
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,660
to the cells extract number four sorry

138
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:17,329
extract number three kill all the cells

139
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:21,140
so we see specificity between types of

140
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:24,259
cannabis to a type of Ken of of cancer

141
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,839
which was very surprising and amazing

142
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:29,240
when we use it on normal cells there is

143
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,789
no normal cells that going growing on a

144
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,160
plate but these cells are without cancer

145
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,700
mutation then it's much less effective

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,160
okay which was another surprising result

147
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,829
so I was very excited and said okay

148
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,320
extract from strain number one

149
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:47,329
scooby-doo and from Mickey Mouse what

150
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,668
what the hell what I am holding in my

151
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:52,149
end okay what are the materials it's the

152
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:55,310
real names what are the materials that

153
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:59,299
really killed the sense that binding the

154
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:01,759
receptor affecting the cells okay and I

155
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,470
looked around I realized that there is a

156
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,990
laboratory in Israel that can read this

157
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,330
I send them the materials and they came

158
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,579
back with five cannabinoids these are

159
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:12,709
the cannabinoid these are the percentage

160
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:14,870
when I looked on the extract extract

161
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:18,139
number two and extract number three was

162
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,790
exactly the same the same can I been

163
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,819
doing the same time cannabinoids that I

164
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:26,330
get a read I got the same percentage so

165
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:28,909
this is not good okay I am lucky I am in

166
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:31,399
Haifa in the north of Israel but I have

167
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,760
my shulam in the center of Israel which

168
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:38,209
is 45 minutes right in Israel so I got

169
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:42,089
iPhone III called Rafi I told him hi

170
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:44,579
this is David from from the Technion

171
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:47,359
and he call he said come over I came

172
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:50,159
Ruffy start to explain everything and

173
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,490
unfortunately I realized that we are

174
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,880
knowing more than 100 cannabinoids today

175
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,100
we recognize over than 144 different

176
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,409
cannabinoids so in my extract I don't

177
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,570
have CBD indeed see that what I'm

178
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,120
looking on there is a lot of others and

179
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:07,980
if to be very disappointed if Raffi want

180
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,009
to kill me also told me a little bit of

181
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,620
temper Turpin's ok over two hundred two

182
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,050
points so actually Lumiere honish

183
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,389
published a review a four months ago

184
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,079
which showed that there is over 500

185
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:24,870
different compound in the extract so as

186
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,449
a scientist where can I start so first I

187
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,959
realized that we see just the tip of the

188
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:34,049
iceberg we look on TD CBD it's not the

189
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:37,529
story at least not with myself ok second

190
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:39,750
in a half the year I went to Colorado I

191
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,949
looked in Israel I went to scientists

192
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,990
and in half a year

193
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:48,480
I hid my hand in the wall because unless

194
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,460
I know what I'm holding or giving to the

195
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,149
cell I can't repeat the experiment I

196
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:57,120
can't identify what is the effect I

197
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:59,100
can't stop to work so for half a year I

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,470
struggle with this question I really

199
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,170
want to do cannabis research ok but I

200
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,450
couldn't so coming back after this half

201
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,699
a year to my laboratory I decided if

202
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,330
we're not doing everything nobody will

203
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,330
help us ok and I will skip on on these

204
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:18,150
slides because the time is short but

205
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:21,030
usually people using HPLC unit standard

206
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:24,480
to see we have today twelve or thirteen

207
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:27,360
standards for cannabinoid from the 144

208
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,330
this is not helping us in the if I will

209
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,509
skip a year and a half forward and we

210
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,610
develop a whole method with LC LC msg

211
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:37,799
CMS and other equipment this is the

212
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,080
method I won't go into it I'm just going

213
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,209
to the point today my laboratory have

214
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,490
the ability to see all the cannabinoids

215
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,490
and all the tear pins so

216
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:52,019
in the end I will show this the

217
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:55,778
miserable Students Club forehand okay

218
00:09:52,019 --> 00:10:00,188
not me so what I'm showing here is a

219
00:09:55,778 --> 00:10:01,869
heat map okay and what we see in the

220
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:03,759
line it's different names of

221
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:05,829
cannabinoids you can recognize it it's

222
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,639
in CBD there but other cannabinoids

223
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:13,958
going down it's just a print screen of

224
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:18,149
of this heat map okay and on the row you

225
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:20,828
can see different extract different

226
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,899
strains that been given in Israel to

227
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:25,988
patient and this is a heat map when you

228
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:28,899
see a dark square the meaning that this

229
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:31,028
can be highly expressed there is numbers

230
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:33,519
behind everything but it's more visual

231
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:35,918
like that okay and when why it's low

232
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,220
Express and what I want to show you on

233
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:41,350
this image that every strain that the

234
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,259
patient get in Israel it's a different

235
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,069
medicine look how different they are

236
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:51,249
from each other there is no two strains

237
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:53,769
that look similar so if we have ninety

238
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:57,159
one strength in Israel I actually have

239
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:59,859
91 different medicine for the patient

240
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,659
and this without starting to say that in

241
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,399
the winter they are growing differently

242
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:07,238
in the summer batches and I will show a

243
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:10,328
little bit of of the results okay so

244
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:13,600
just to showing you on the blue side

245
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:17,378
okay you see the mark in blue this is

246
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,909
too high CBD strains low TC 20 to 1 and

247
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:21,220
these are the two strains that were

248
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:23,259
extract to an extract 3 and see how

249
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,889
different they are so it's true that the

250
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:28,600
CBD is very similar but all other

251
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,428
compounds are different this is the

252
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,319
reason those 1 cell 1

253
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:36,879
X are killing the cell and the other is

254
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:39,278
not killing the cell ok so having we did

255
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:43,480
the same thing with 2 pens and also it's

256
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:45,938
all around a lot of result so having

257
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,428
this ability to see all the compounds

258
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:50,980
actually did something to my lab that I

259
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:54,220
didn't expect it's open the world to my

260
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,839
lab because now every girl every startup

261
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,449
every physician they're doing clinical

262
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,440
trial coming to my lab and said hey I

263
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:01,990
want to know what I'm

264
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,540
to the patient if it's extract if I'm I

265
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,610
have a perfect test train I saw a guy

266
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:08,769
outside that's saying that his train is

267
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,080
better than others okay he's coming to

268
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,789
my lab said okay I want to prove it read

269
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,020
all the canape Linda they have I want to

270
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:17,589
see if there is different cannabinoids

271
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:21,159
so my lab in the last year you grew in

272
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:23,620
in unexpected way and we're doing today

273
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:26,469
a lot of things not just cancer so I've

274
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,690
actually four groups in my lab one group

275
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,279
is doing all the chemist analysis so

276
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,200
we're asking what are the difference

277
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,329
between ethanol extraction Boonton

278
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,270
extraction co2 extraction there is a

279
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:40,090
huge difference if you taking one strain

280
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,399
and doing Boonton extraction versus co2

281
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,920
extraction or ethanol exactly you get a

282
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,620
different medicine it's a different

283
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:49,449
compounds that you get in the end fine

284
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,970
heating and CBD are there but you're

285
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:55,120
losing cannabinoids you're gaining other

286
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:58,029
terpenes you changing the portfolio

287
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,919
totally okay so what are the

288
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:01,509
bioavailability when you smoke when

289
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,639
you're taking a pill what is reaching to

290
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,980
the blood okay all this question we have

291
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:09,009
the ability to answer while we knowing

292
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,659
to see this compound okay so this is a

293
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:11,950
group that doing chemist analysis have a

294
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:15,129
group they're doing in neurobiology

295
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,900
mainly epilepsy brain development and

296
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:18,909
sleep and I won't touch it at all in

297
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,860
this talk I have a group that doing

298
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:23,409
database that were collecting that on

299
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,600
the patient versus they cannabinoid that

300
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:27,909
they are taking and I speak about it for

301
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,769
two minutes if I will have the time but

302
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,049
I want to show you few results from the

303
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:35,500
cancer group that still it's the main

304
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:37,659
group in my lab and in the cancer as I

305
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,309
told you we can grow the cells in the

306
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:41,980
plate but we can also grow them in a

307
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:44,319
plate that have many wells the long one

308
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,330
called 96-well every scientist of the

309
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,360
physician know this plate okay so you

310
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,879
can take glioblastoma or pancreatic

311
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,860
cancer and the same one grow in this

312
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,470
plate so you actually can do in one

313
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,190
plate 96 different experiments you can

314
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:02,320
do 96 dosages 96 different the strain

315
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,780
whatever you want and I have in my lab

316
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,210
this machine which is known as a

317
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:11,289
high-throughput screening so this is

318
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,920
incubator connected to co2 and to oxygen

319
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:14,199
and

320
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,419
I think the cells need to grow live and

321
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,278
there is a camera there is a microscope

322
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:20,679
on top of it that know how to move

323
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:23,500
between the wells and take images it can

324
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,388
take over them 1,000 images an hour if

325
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,549
they have fluorescence so you can put

326
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:31,180
markers so in the end you get these

327
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:34,028
images today to the computer and you can

328
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:37,149
analyze it images so make the story

329
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:40,028
short you get in the end like a table

330
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:43,448
with Jerry tell you in which well it was

331
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:45,809
most effective okay in well c4 you can

332
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:50,500
100% of the cells through apoptosis

333
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:53,009
while insane well a d7 nothing happened

334
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,539
so in that way we can screen a lot of

335
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:59,198
different dosages or a lot of different

336
00:14:55,539 --> 00:15:01,629
extract find the one that is most potent

337
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,208
and start to work with it for a specific

338
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:06,850
type of cancer okay so when I'm finding

339
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:09,909
something specific with one strain that

340
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:12,310
killed specific is a cancer with a

341
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,230
specific mutation and put a PhD student

342
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:17,619
and the miserable guy need to work on

343
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:21,759
this for years okay but that the way I

344
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:24,039
did it before and you know I'm kidding

345
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,649
but but when we find something like that

346
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:29,289
we put a student and and this is like

347
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:33,220
his goal so I want to show you few

348
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:36,458
results that showing how much complex

349
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,379
this area and how much it's not if we

350
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,268
can't say that cannabis is good for

351
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:42,159
cancer or something like that so what

352
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,750
you say on top is them it's the images

353
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,879
that you we get from this machine you

354
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,089
see that in the left corner you see the

355
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,669
control and then we put a mic a it's a

356
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:54,730
name of face of strain it's killing all

357
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:58,509
the cells and RN doing nothing but I

358
00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:01,600
want to focus on the on the graph here

359
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:03,370
with the color so every color it's a

360
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,409
different strain extract from a

361
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,629
different strength and what we see on

362
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:11,740
this graph is the percentage of the

363
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:14,409
cells a dime okay will end on the extra

364
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,750
you see a dosages to my program for my

365
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:20,559
program six microgram eight microgram

366
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:23,860
okay so you can see if we focus on four

367
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:26,229
microgram per ml that there are strains

368
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:31,209
doing nothing

369
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:32,980
a 375 it's melanoma cancer okay you see

370
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:35,889
that in for my program there are

371
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,870
strangely doing nothing to this self by

372
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:39,039
while there are strains at killing fifty

373
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,110
percent of the cells and there are

374
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,659
strains at killing most of the cells so

375
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,519
what I want to show you it you can see

376
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:48,159
cannabis is killing the cells you need

377
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,379
to need to know which cannabis will kill

378
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:54,519
these cells okay and if you look here

379
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:57,458
you will see that a day the gray one is

380
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,769
melanoma the black one is lung cancer

381
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:02,409
and you can see that there are strains

382
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,929
that are very good to kill the melanoma

383
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:07,359
but doing nothing to the lung cancer as

384
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,939
I show you before and if I will take it

385
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,418
to the next step if we look on these

386
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:18,040
cells and we choose one strain Mike a

387
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:20,439
okay which kill 70% of the cells with

388
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:24,250
for my programs and now we're taking

389
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:26,798
this strain and we've purified the teeth

390
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:31,450
then the CBD from this strain we have

391
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:34,119
now 100% 98% pure T 80 from this train

392
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,039
it's the same THC right it's not

393
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:39,548
synthetic whatever I'm not going to

394
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:42,009
these politics questions okay and with

395
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:44,259
you purified in and give now to the

396
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:47,200
cells you see that even in eight

397
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:50,200
microgram of purity T which is twenty

398
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,590
times more than we give the extract look

399
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,690
on the green one which is the a 375 it's

400
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:58,240
doing nothing to the cells okay

401
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:00,370
so it's not that easy we did it also

402
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,380
with the CBD it's not the CBD it's

403
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:05,469
something more I will show another

404
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,559
example so this is if you taking this

405
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:11,110
pure and add it to the extract again is

406
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:14,289
doing nothing it's not the tea it's in

407
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:17,439
the CBD in these types of cell of cells

408
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:20,200
okay if we I will give another example

409
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,650
on prostate cancer so we see in the left

410
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,750
side fix extract and you see that now

411
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,330
it's the opposite it's the variability

412
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,240
how much the cell survive so when you

413
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:33,189
see a lower bar it's better it's giving

414
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,740
more cells so it's is that extract

415
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,279
number one is very useful by killing the

416
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:42,130
cell while while other extract is not

417
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,869
useful so I will tell you I I know

418
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,240
exactly what the difference to treat

419
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:48,428
cells in Mysore in the plate versus a

420
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,019
person there is a huge gap so don't

421
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:51,610
learn from this that this is what you

422
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:55,509
need to treat people that you know okay

423
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:58,000
but I want to do an extrapolation let's

424
00:18:55,509 --> 00:19:00,250
do a mind thinking okay if you own a

425
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,740
patient now and you're going to pick

426
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,048
strains that will help you for prostate

427
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,440
cancer what is the possibility that you

428
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:12,548
pick the right one it's very low now I

429
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:15,700
want to be a the bad guy a little bit

430
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:17,740
more okay so I will tell you that

431
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:22,298
extract number one and extract number

432
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:25,990
six are the exact same extract we

433
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:30,190
extract from one strain from from the

434
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:32,409
girl we separated it to one we activated

435
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:36,250
it okay there was a question here we

436
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:39,039
activate the we heat it to be activated

437
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,619
to decarboxylate okay and the other not

438
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,929
straight number one extract number one

439
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:48,428
is without the heating and strength

440
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:50,350
number six is after heating okay so now

441
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:52,840
here if you're patient and you're very

442
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:55,119
lucky and you pick the right strain but

443
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:58,000
you're smoking it it won't help you

444
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:00,668
according to these results okay so now

445
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,519
you said okay David say tell us that not

446
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:06,700
that they make dhikr books the day the

447
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,019
acid form is better to put to cancer so

448
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,798
look on the other side in glioblastoma

449
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:15,548
it's not the story after heating it it's

450
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:18,879
much better so what I'm trying to say it

451
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:21,759
still so complex and still we know so

452
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,610
little that we need to be very careful

453
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:28,390
to say what is good and not good what is

454
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:32,349
working and not working okay I want to

455
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:35,350
skip everything because I'm red okay and

456
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:40,178
I want to show two things very very

457
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:43,209
shortly how can I go back okay I want to

458
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:45,429
show two things very shortly one it's

459
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,380
something that we got last month there

460
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,509
is a clinical trials that need to run

461
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,330
they asked they need to prepare a lot of

462
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:52,750
materials they grew the same strain the

463
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:55,389
same

464
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,919
genetic planting in the same day but

465
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,690
because they need a lot of material

466
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,700
they're planting in five different

467
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,710
greenhouse okay four different

468
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,069
greenhouse we got this sample look how

469
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,298
different the it's the same genetic of

470
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:10,689
the plant just growing in different

471
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:12,339
greenhouse okay so this is a problem

472
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,279
that we're facing every time we're

473
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:17,379
getting different materials okay that's

474
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,990
first of all second I want to show to

475
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,720
say very very shortly that the for group

476
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,569
in my lab doing cannabis database and

477
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,240
the database that we are doing having

478
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:30,069
the knowledge that we are the

479
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,319
laboratories that know exactly what the

480
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:34,990
patient getting from bottom to top we

481
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:38,558
can follow up on this patient so we did

482
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:41,890
we are doing this database well first

483
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:45,250
aim we create a cannabis strain database

484
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,799
every cannabis every plane to extract

485
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,808
that patient can get in Israel

486
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:52,298
everything that the patient can get is

487
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:55,029
coming from first to our laboratory and

488
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:58,058
we're doing all the amplification so if

489
00:21:55,029 --> 00:22:00,668
you ant is getting a Mickey Mouse in

490
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:03,250
December I know what she got okay

491
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:05,710
the same are the second arm we're doing

492
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,470
follow-up on all the patient in Israel

493
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,360
we're getting all the data from them we

494
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,700
build a questionnaire and I won't go

495
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:16,869
into it because of the time but the idea

496
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,700
is to say okay this 75 strains increase

497
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:21,849
appetite in eighty percent of the

498
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:25,440
patient what are the materials in in

499
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:27,730
this in these 75 strains that are common

500
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,380
that increase appetite that are not

501
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,599
existing the standard don't increase

502
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,059
appetite and this to take to clinical

503
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,519
trials and to model and mice model to

504
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:39,308
make it evidence-based just and I'm

505
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,319
finished here show you one example with

506
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:43,720
the strength of it we are tweeting in

507
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,970
Israel 70 kids with autism severe autism

508
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,659
and the result of phenomenon and one

509
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:51,870
gate which would you say anxiety reduce

510
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:55,630
the violence there are more concentrated

511
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:59,288
more variable okay everything is perfect

512
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,179

00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:15,250
