2
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:18,960
this study has been uh submitted and

3
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:21,118
approved through their IRB um we are

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,560
looking specifically for just really

5
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,160
simply uh two criteria basically are you

6
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:28,399
an adult we need 18 or older um there's

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,198
just too much uh complexity in trying to

8
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,278
get this info from kids hopefully can

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,920
start to uncover more about Pediatrics

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,960
later so we need you to be an adult who

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,879
either has been diagnosed with CHS or is

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,120
believes they're suffering with CHS

13
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:42,479
right we don't need you to be diagnosed

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,919
by a doctor but we we need you to kind

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,558
of think like this is this is what I'm

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,000
pretty sure what's going on um and we're

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,759
going to we got a Litany of questions

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,920
right it's two parts each part's going

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,159
to take about 25 minutes it's a long

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,198
time I do recognize but to make it more

21
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,959
valuable for you you will be entered

22
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,079
when you complete the survey into a

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,400
raffle for $100 gift card um we're

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,319
leaning towards Amazon but not the brand

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
drop uh but we're gonna we're still

26
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,639
figuring out where where that's going to

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,880
come from um but yeah it's we're really

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,599
excited to drop this two-part survey to

29
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,798
understand both the symptoms and use

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,959
patterns and then also the burden how

31
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,520
much health care you know how how hard

32
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,679
has this been on you and your family and

33
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,640
the truth is it's going to be what

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,439
organs did you have removed that's

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,079
literally a thing right did someone cut

36
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:30,798
out your appendix during the process of

37
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:32,759
trying to discover that all of this

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,320
inflammation was because your endocrine

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,879
ammonoid system was out of balance

40
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:41,438
because you've been smoking uh too much

41
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,438
cannabis or marijuana as they say

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:55,269
