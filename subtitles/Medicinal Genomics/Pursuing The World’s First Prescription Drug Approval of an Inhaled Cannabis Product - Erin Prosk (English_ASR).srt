1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,330
hi thanks everyone thank you for that

2
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:13,820
introduction as well which to what is my

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:18,079
ultimate mission to bring you all to

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,879
Canada I'm here to recruit you where we

5
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,250
can do a little bit we have a little bit

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,140
easier access to two early phases of

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,320
research in in cannabis space medicine

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,230
so I'm here to represent my organization

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,109
Sante cannabis our team of our small

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,299
team here that contributed to this work

11
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:39,289
but our larger team back home in

12
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:41,089
Montreal Quebec so just some disclosure

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,429
so I'm going to present about what is an

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,650
investigational drug which is owned by

15
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:48,170
sponsor tetra biopharma and some work

16
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:51,949
that was done at large CRO North

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,140
American CRO so we've heard we've talked

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,060
a bit about Canada we've got some

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,469
excitement happening both with the

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,079
introduction of the cannabis act last

21
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:02,359
week which legalized cannabis for adult

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,969
use but we have a proliferation of

23
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,789
licensed producers and manufacturers of

24
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:10,188
products in Canada that are regulated

25
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,920
federally and we have access to the

26
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:14,898
Machine of regulatory investigational

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,149
processes that allow the development of

28
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:20,299
cannabis based drugs governed by the

29
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:21,799
same division that looks at other the

30
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,049
development of other pharmaceutical

31
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,840
medications we also have with the

32
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,670
cannabis act a lot of opportunity for

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,969
smaller cultivators processors

34
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,728
manufacturers to get into the game as

35
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:38,138
there is now a inclusive framework for

36
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:40,908
different sizes of production and

37
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:42,798
facilities so in the cannabis act as

38
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,899
well we saw a streamlining of access to

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,389
cannabis products for research purposes

40
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:51,608
and this should make working in this

41
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:55,759
this field much easier moving forward so

42
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:57,199
we don't have really a huge revolution

43
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,539
happening though we've had a lot of

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,009
cannabis dispensaries so a lot of the

45
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:02,810
hype around you know how much of a

46
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,438
change this is on the ground level

47
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,270
it isn't really founded because we had a

48
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:09,949
gray area dispensaries hundreds of them

49
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,240
operating it's more of a shift for those

50
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,310
of us who've been working in this field

51
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,290
for a long time to suddenly see these

52
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,269
dispensaries having closing out sales in

53
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,219
preparation for what our government

54
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,060
suppliers to take over so this is the

55
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:23,240
aunty

56
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,670
retailer here in our largest province

57
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,159
and quotes on Twitter just astounded by

58
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:33,469
the interest in their their products

59
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:35,539
which we all know very well so cannabis

60
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:37,460
means medicine in Canada obviously we

61
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:39,679
have a lot of the same opportunities and

62
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,950
challenges that you see here but

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,770
importantly if we look at a lot of the

64
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:48,859
challenges over here we decide that we

65
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:52,390
can look at these access access to

66
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:57,020
information research education training

67
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:59,569
stigmatization and take the the focus on

68
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,700
the opportunity of redeveloping research

69
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:04,340
products and investigational drugs to

70
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:06,589
address this long list of challenges

71
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,530
that we have so that brings us to our

72
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,900
mission at Sante cannabis where we exist

73
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,129
in in Quebec

74
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,289
santÃ© very important for you know means

75
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:17,810
health in French I've had to translate

76
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:21,979
to quite a few Americans this this week

77
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,989
and we facilitate a series of clinics

78
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:26,569
across the province where we're

79
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,700
supporting patient access to physicians

80
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,370
and our nursing team for support

81
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:33,018
education and treatment plans but we're

82
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,890
also collecting a huge battery of

83
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:39,110
different research outcome measures so

84
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:40,458
to do that it does involve quite a few

85
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,790
different people but this is a glimpse

86
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,489
at our clinic and research model so we

87
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:48,019
initiate with a referral from a

88
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:50,870
physician treating the patient on in

89
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:53,900
primary care and then run that through

90
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,420
our system to to initiate the patient

91
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,069
into our research database the patient

92
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,958
will be seen in person at the clinic by

93
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:02,030
a nurse who will do a complete

94
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,599
assessment and be able to collect a huge

95
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,400
list of baseline data the nurse works

96
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,079
together with the physician to implement

97
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,569
the treatment plan for that patient and

98
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,120
then critically we have our core of our

99
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:16,879
team the nurse educators who provide

100
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,009
education follow-up supports

101
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:23,029
modification of dosages and product

102
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:25,009
recommendations ongoing and this is all

103
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:28,098
adhering to a physician standardized

104
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:30,199
treatment plan so what that means is

105
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:33,620
then we're able to take that experience

106
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,930
all data observational data which work

107
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,240
electing from the patient and take that

108
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,459
over - from a sponsor small biotech

109
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,250
companies experts in drug development

110
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:46,609
who are looking for keys - to their

111
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,100
development and start to initiate a

112
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,110
process where we can develop cannabis

113
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,490
based drugs in parallel with our work at

114
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,830
the clinic so as we know there's a very

115
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,470
complexity of treatment options we have

116
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:03,079
more than 100 browsers in Canada each

117
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,510
producing between 10 and 50 different

118
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,788
products so this translates into a huge

119
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:10,639
number price we start to then categorize

120
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:12,829
the the products that are available in

121
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,720
two different formulations of THC CBD

122
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:16,459
and try to collect as much data as

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,039
possible about other cannabinoids and

124
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:23,779
terpenoids selection primarily between

125
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:27,589
inhalation and oral which is what we

126
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:30,138
have available in Canada then if we dig

127
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:32,119
in to the patient use patterns at the

128
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,728
clinic we still see that we are in a

129
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,160
transitionary phase so in methods of an

130
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:38,449
administration while oil or oral

131
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,330
administration has been growing in

132
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:44,360
popularity and is now our most common

133
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:46,668
method of use we see a still a lot of

134
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,759
inhalation which has been persistent

135
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:51,649
over time so more than 50% of patients

136
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,629
are using inhalation in some form

137
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:56,478
weathering incorporated with oil or on

138
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:58,069
its own and in that category of

139
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,899
inhalation we still see a very

140
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:03,110
persistent population that is insistent

141
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:04,819
on smoking as well so vaporization has

142
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,430
been growing but even patients who have

143
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,930
a vaporizer often report that smoking

144
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,699
can be more effective for them and are

145
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,910
often using the two in tandem or in a

146
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,860
kind of mixed model of inhalation so

147
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,169
this drives this question what is going

148
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,479
on with this smoking and why patients

149
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:22,370
are still reporting such a difference

150
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,699
between vaporization and smoking

151
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,769
administrations so the big question of

152
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,329
inhalation is then you know is it

153
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:31,819
necessary we have all of these other

154
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,620
methods that are developing especially

155
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:36,560
here in California and other US states

156
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,209
where you have topical creams something

157
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,639
you will sprays patches things like that

158
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:42,348
but we still see this persistent desire

159
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,120
for inhalation and especially if we

160
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:46,668
think about specific symptom categories

161
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,480
such as breakthrough pain nausea

162
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:50,930
vomiting

163
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,819
appetite stimulation and the potential

164
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,189
for substitution as well of problematic

165
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,259
substances of abuse this kind of rapid

166
00:06:55,189 --> 00:07:01,160
onset of inhalation is thought to be

167
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:03,110
very critical so if we think about the

168
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,720
ongoing development of inhalation as a

169
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,129
method of administration it's our goal

170
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,920
to really go back and look at the root

171
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:11,959
of the issue so inhalation methods

172
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,819
though we have a lot of information that

173
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,129
has been published about there in vitro

174
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:18,379
results such as using an artificial lung

175
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:20,569
analyzing components in the smoke or the

176
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:23,300
vapor we don't have enough information

177
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:27,680
about the in human response to these

178
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:30,170
different methods of administration so

179
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,610
this products to work with the sponsor

180
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,800
I'm highlighting here this is the

181
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,379
product that was developed for analysis

182
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,319
and comparison between smoked

183
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:41,029
administration and vaporized it's named

184
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:42,740
as the investigational drug PPV zero

185
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:45,169
zero one active pharmaceutical

186
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,540
ingredient both THC and CBD and a

187
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,160
specific ratio so this product is

188
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,360
standardized as a blend of three

189
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,820
different strains of dried cannabis at a

190
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,150
dosage of 280 milligrams of whole plant

191
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:02,180
material and standardized to have a

192
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:04,909
dosage of 25 milligrams THC and five

193
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,720
point five milligrams of CBD per pellet

194
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:14,060
then in the placebo we have zero THC and

195
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,380
a small fraction of CBD so the objective

196
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,480
of this first study which I'll present

197
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,779
today is to evaluate this safety and

198
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,680
tolerability of this fixed dose in an

199
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:26,329
inhaled or smoked THC and CBD

200
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,410
administration over one day and then

201
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:34,039
over seven consecutive days the methods

202
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:36,918
I involve a kind of clear standard

203
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,379
process for a phase one double-blind

204
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:42,259
placebo-controlled so we'll be doing at

205
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:45,470
single and multiple daily doses in both

206
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:47,809
of those cohorts so importantly this was

207
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,330
a very popular study and recruitment

208
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:52,129
because subjects were confined for

209
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,889
monitoring during the entire duration of

210
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:57,830
the period and for 36 hours pre and post

211
00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:00,590
so it involved a lot of video games and

212
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,120
being paid quite well for that time

213
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,100
this was a approved according to

214
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,080
standard procedures and we're looking

215
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,500
really primarily at safety outcome so

216
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,290
vital signs ECG was done at various time

217
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,480
points physical exam and the battery of

218
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:16,129
clinical laboratory tests to look at

219
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,879
different safety outcomes including a

220
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:21,620
standard process for cognition the

221
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,409
device that was used as an inhalation

222
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,419
device approved actually in Canada as a

223
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,339
class to medical device it's a titanium

224
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:31,819
pipe which can be used to smoke cannabis

225
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,440
and this was a standardized controlled

226
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,190
inhalation to try to get as close as

227
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,930
possible to a standardized dose so it

228
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,180
was very carefully instructed to inhale

229
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:44,029
for three seconds hold for three seconds

230
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:45,859
exhale and and repeat the process for as

231
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:51,620
many inhalations is required to complete

232
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:54,919
the dose so in the first cohort these

233
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,070
patients were looked at were divided

234
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,949
into a group of groups of eight subjects

235
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,200
and dosage was first just once daily for

236
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,860
one day and then moving to twice and

237
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,450
three times a day with the same product

238
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,430
then that safety data would be analyzed

239
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,379
before proceeding to the second cohort

240
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:14,959
which would essentially progress through

241
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:18,259
that same process over a seven day

242
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,850
period so importantly in the

243
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:22,069
demographics we had a pretty good range

244
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,659
of age from twenty five all the way up

245
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,870
to sixty years old

246
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:30,319
primarily for sixty percent male but and

247
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:33,759
primarily Caucasian average BMI and

248
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,140
pretty standard other measures of health

249
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,460
so when we look at the pharmacokinetics

250
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:39,069
this is where things start to get really

251
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,040
interesting when we look at smoked

252
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:45,379
administration we had THC and CBD

253
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:47,719
detectable in the first blood draw one

254
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,730
minute after inhalation and for most

255
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,290
subjects this remained for about three

256
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,300
hours though many of them had almost

257
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:56,240
complete elimination after one hour post

258
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:58,819
administration the maximum concentration

259
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,529
or C max was very variable even with the

260
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,870
very standardized method of inhalation

261
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:04,850
that we employed with the maximum

262
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:08,330
concentration of 30 all the way to 180

263
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,940
nanograms per ml now 180 is something

264
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,590
that's very rarely observed I think

265
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,780
there's one report of

266
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:19,220
of such concentration in a clinical

267
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:20,600
study usually we see 50 to 60 nanogram

268
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,920
per ml as a c-max

269
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,560
in vaporization studies so the maximum

270
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,979
time for over on average was 5 minutes

271
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,909
so that's the peak plasma level

272
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,240
occurring at five minutes post

273
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:37,039
administration and in this cohort we

274
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,409
didn't see any accumulation effect at

275
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,120
all so part neck before the next dose

276
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:44,419
was administered there was completed

277
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,360
elimination of the THC CBD and the the

278
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:50,899
metabolite alpha 11 hydroxy we also

279
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,879
didn't see any set steady state so in

280
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,500
pharmacodynamics we can see that there's

281
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,629
an impaired cognition actually after the

282
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,490
first administration but that this

283
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:00,950
actually resolved as we were

284
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,389
administering further so we saw some

285
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,100
development of tolerance though in this

286
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:10,069
small population it can be difficult to

287
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:12,440
make large estimates of that effect we

288
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,460
also saw some limitations that we

289
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,530
weren't looking for functional

290
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,310
impairment but just a standard

291
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,720
impairment small sample size and and I'm

292
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:22,459
not sure yet about clinical significance

293
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,000
until we move to our next round of

294
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,920
studies so something that's very

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,779
interesting in the data is if we look in

296
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,959
an it's exactly at these different

297
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,549
subjects so this safety affect the

298
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,460
safety report actually stopped the study

299
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:39,979
periodically a severe adverse reaction

300
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,050
and to moderate ones when she involved

301
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,670
the subject fainting now this was a 52

302
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:45,319
year old Caucasian female she'd been

303
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:47,509
exposed to cannabis in the past so was

304
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,070
used to the effects and you would expect

305
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:50,480
her to have a very high concentration in

306
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,000
her blood but actually she was below

307
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,009
average with just a 50 to nanogram per

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,899
ml so this is really showing the

309
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,990
difference between subjects and how this

310
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:01,819
response can be also very psychosomatic

311
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,129
there were no clinical reasons why this

312
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,830
subject should have fainted and when we

313
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:08,120
think about the dosage of just 25

314
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,460
milligrams of THC it's quite shocking

315
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,320
that someone could have this effect from

316
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,840
that dosage considering the doses that

317
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,170
are sold and used in in dispensaries and

318
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,509
other clinical settings so in comparison

319
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:23,699
this subject 25 years old Asian female

320
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:27,659
with a pretty low birth rate and low

321
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:30,560
resting blood pressure had a very mild

322
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,250
side effects but had the very highest

323
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,009
concentration in her blood

324
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,799
so her tolerance to the 180 nanogram per

325
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:40,080
ml concentration was quite surprising

326
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:45,929
same cohort same dose but a very

327
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:47,910
interactive and as many of you know

328
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:50,699
working in cannabis the start low go

329
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:52,579
slow really holds true through through

330
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,190
clinical setting and through

331
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:58,710
double-blind trials where we saw that a

332
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,600
titration strategy was necessary to

333
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,940
progress to a seven-day administration

334
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,080
after subject number three had such a

335
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,880
response so we introduced a slower

336
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,400
titration to move subjects towards the

337
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,049
full dose as they move towards the

338
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,840
seven-day administration so they started

339
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:20,399
with just one inhalation and moved up to

340
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:22,980
two completing the entire pellet so this

341
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,569
was this was done to satisfy Health

342
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,550
Canada to progress to the seven-day

343
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,730
administration and showed a significant

344
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:33,149
improvement in the the adverse event

345
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:36,149
profile so overall you see here that

346
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:37,709
these are normalized to the number of

347
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:39,269
dosages that were administered so

348
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,240
actually when that titration was

349
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:45,269
administered the start low go slow

350
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,669
process we see that that cohort actually

351
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,980
had lower instance of adverse events

352
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:52,500
than the placebo did in the prior cohort

353
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,870
so we really see a significance there

354
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,529
otherwise the most common events are

355
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:01,889
somnolence dizziness and headache as

356
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:03,720
well as some euphoria so overall this

357
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:06,000
was a very successful seven-day

358
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,279
administration so importantly now for

359
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,750
safety really this big question is can

360
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:13,439
this drug be moved into Phase two and

361
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,179
three that was clear from the results

362
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,550
there was nothing clinically significant

363
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:21,239
in cardiovascular no drug-related

364
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:23,549
changes in serum hematology or urine and

365
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,639
everything was primarily mild that was

366
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:29,159
reported 82 and 94 percent in the two

367
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,539
cohorts and we had no serious adverse

368
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,039
events at all nothing life-threatening

369
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:37,679
or a hospital requiring hospitalization

370
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:40,019
so this product has moved into now

371
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,579
couple of different trials the first one

372
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,649
a phase 3 trial which is really a

373
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,750
compassionate use focus we are

374
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:49,110
recruiting for this right now in Quebec

375
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:52,339
and are looking for other sites so feel

376
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:55,769
free to reach out to us 3 minutes and

377
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:58,649
finally this was found to be generally

378
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:00,539
safe and well tolerated the protocol is

379
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:02,909
to be repeated with with a vaporizer

380
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:05,458
next month to compare the different

381
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:07,230
results and to see the the differences

382
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:10,799
in in pharmacodynamics which is very

383
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:14,070
interesting it's interesting as well to

384
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,929
look at now why this concentration may

385
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,180
exceed that would be seen in vaporizer

386
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:20,629
studies so once we verify that it will

387
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:23,088
give us a better idea of in which

388
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:25,919
populations smoked cannabis may be

389
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,589
preferential over vaporized and explain

390
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,909
a little bit of why we we see the

391
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:33,680
differences in the in the patient

392
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:36,569
reporting and then finally that the this

393
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:39,149
maximum time of a very rapid delivery

394
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,330
could be the most effective way to to

395
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:43,799
treat acute symptoms

396
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,900
finally a limitation that is worth a

397
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,149
really heavy investigation in tech is

398
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,949
that this variability in inhalation is

399
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:51,659
going to be a huge challenge and will

400
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:56,100
require some very innovative drug

401
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:58,230
delivery systems so here's the pitch if

402
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,230
you're interested to to study this drug

403
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,389
please reach out to our company or to to

404
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,240
tetra biopharma and it will be available

405
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:09,709
as well internationally and for any

406
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,709
contacts thank you very much

407
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:19,670
[Applause]

408
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,800
hi that was a great presentation dr.

409
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,269
Carolyn McCallum from Vancouver BC I'm

410
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,399
just wondering if you can elaborate a

411
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:27,619
little bit more on the neurocognitive

412
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,980
impairment if there was a standardized

413
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:34,369
questionnaire that was giving patients

414
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,970
or if it was a functional examination or

415
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:40,099
how you guys classified that there was a

416
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,579
series of tests that were performed for

417
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:46,969
both short-term memory for small motor

418
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:50,029
skills as well as the kind of standard

419
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,890
making mini cognitive effects for for

420
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:53,629
cognition but unfortunately we didn't

421
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,640
study functional impairment which is

422
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,560
something that we'll look at in future

423
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,110
studies as we would be you know

424
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,069
concerned about certain populations

425
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:03,439
oncology populations geriatric

426
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:07,240
populations to to use this product

427
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,240
without that assessment great thanks
