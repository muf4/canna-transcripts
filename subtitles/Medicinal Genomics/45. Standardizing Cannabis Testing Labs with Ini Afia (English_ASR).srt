65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,878
this episode we welcome back iniafia to

66
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,519
talk about the push to standardize

67
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,439
cannabis testing labs in california

68
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,680
in late november the california

69
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,120
department of cannabis control issued a

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,519
statement that they are planning to

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,239
standardize operating procedures and

72
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,560
methods for california cannabis labs by

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,039
january 2023

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,759
this announcement got mixed reaction

75
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,639
on the one hand consumers and producers

76
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,000
have expressed frustration with

77
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,479
inconsistencies and lab results so they

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,158
welcomed the idea however many

79
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,719
laboratory professionals were quick to

80
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,079
point out that standardization is easier

81
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,680
said than done

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,000
especially because the state didn't

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,040
offer much insight into what exactly the

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,318
dcc would standardize or how they would

85
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,000
do it

86
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,000
any is qualified to speak on this

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,719
subject because he is the chief science

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,199
officer at canasafe a licensed cannabis

89
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,519
testing lab in southern california

90
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,560
he has also set up multiple labs with

91
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,120
best in-class methodology processes and

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,360
technology throughout his career

93
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,158
and at canasafe he has led the team

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,319
towards greater credibility consistency

95
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:56,079
and accountability for their clients

96
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,079
regulators and consumers

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,840
during our conversation we discuss why

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,158
lab standardization is a good idea

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,360
the problem of lab shopping

100
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,399
why some labs intentionally inflate thc

101
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,640
values

102
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,840
how natural variations in the cannabis

103
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,359
plant can create a range of potency

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,680
results how mishandling certified

105
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,959
reference materials can throw off lab

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
results

107
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,360
why labs need to be more transparent

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,759
with their measurement of uncertainty

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,400
and whether standardization will stifle

110
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,840
lab innovation which is so important in

111
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,679
an emerging industry

112
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,000

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,160

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,080
or was it something you knew was coming

132
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,759
um this sort of came as a surprise

133
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,599
announcement i mean if you looked at the

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,199
regulations

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,960
or i should say sb 544 you knew

136
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,199
something should have been coming but

137
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,279
the way it was announced was

138
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,520
kind of a surprise

139
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,719
what was surprising about it

140
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,120
well you know

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,400
it just seemed like it was just thrown

142
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
out there

143
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,879
as oh here you go let's see how people

144
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,560
digest this um i felt like there could

145
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,000
have been a little more

146
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,680
uh meat to it um it was just sort of

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,759
hey we're gonna standardize and then

148
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,478
everybody's like okay what does that

149
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,479
mean yeah

150
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,840
right and so have there been details

151
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
kind of since then and i was going to

152
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,918
ask you about that because i mean in the

153
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,560
articles that i've read it's basically

154
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,639
that you know the dcc is supposed to

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,000
standardize operating procedures and

156
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,639
methods for

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,839
california cannabis labs by january 2023

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
now have you gotten any sort of

159
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,799
indication of whether they are going to

160
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,199
involve labs like yourselves kind of in

161
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
that process in terms of

162
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,520
recommending certain instruments or

163
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,560
methods or standards has there been any

164
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:59,279
more details come out about that

165
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,598
um you know there hasn't been any formal

166
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,758
details that i've seen

167
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,598
sort of come out about that

168
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
however i have seen something about the

169
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,719
bcc cannabis committee

170
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,598
being formed and they were asking for

171
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
some representative folks to apply to be

172
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,598
on that committee

173
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,199
so i suppose those are all connected and

174
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,199
headed towards that way and i've heard

175
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,680
some new stories about you know state

176
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,720
reference labs and whatnot um that's

177
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,959
underway

178
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,400
um so i would assume all this is tied

179
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,038
into that

180
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,839
the state recently um i've been sending

181
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:36,240
out emails to labs getting trying to get

182
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,879
them to standardize the way they report

183
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,439
on their coa specifically how labs are

184
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,319
reporting total cannabinoids

185
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,680
and and some and some units on the

186
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,759
limits of detection and limits of

187
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,598
quantification so i think they're

188
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,319
already starting work towards that

189
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:55,279
standardization and getting the coa to

190
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,039
all look the same is probably one way

191
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,439
they're trying to make it easier to

192
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,598
quickly read that and and folks who

193
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,639
understand it

194
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,159
okay

195
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,918
and now

196
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
do you have any indication

197
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,560
are they going to actually

198
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,000
standardize certain equipment like are

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,839
labs like yours going to potentially

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
have to purchase new equipment i know

201
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,478
that that

202
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
that stuff doesn't come cheap especially

203
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,318
when you're talking about you know the

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
instruments used to analyze pesticides

205
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,720
and things like that

206
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,280
yeah you know honestly um if they do it

207
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,160
correctly which again i'm excited to

208
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,359
see how the state plans to execute this

209
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,839
because one thing to say it in a

210
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,278
secondary thing to execute it

211
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,320
i don't believe that they would ever

212
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:42,158
move to the standardization of equipment

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,080
or even necessarily a single compendium

214
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,360
method let's say for instance an aoac

215
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,000
method or

216
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,519
or an astm method um i do feel that in

217
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,958
standardization you know they would

218
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,799
recommend some things let's say we're

219
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,199
talking about potency

220
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,719
sort of the way usp does it is if they

221
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,800
are

222
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
putting out a compendium method they

223
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,240
refer to a certain column like a

224
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,919
consumable like a column they would say

225
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,759
usb l1 column to designate like a c18

226
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,360
column right they wouldn't necessarily

227
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,319
say oh the c18 raptor from rustic or you

228
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,399
know

229
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,200
agilent or whatnot so

230
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,360
um i feel like in some sense no it

231
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,360
wouldn't necessarily tie you to a

232
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,680
certain vendor

233
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,120
it might for some labs to upgrade

234
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,799
equipment

235
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,679
personally

236
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,799
my lab has high level equipment that is

237
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,199
able to

238
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,719
really meet the demands or whatever sort

239
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,200
of regulation might be put out there in

240
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,360
terms of limits of detection and whatnot

241
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,959
but for folks who maybe were not

242
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,919
thinking ahead of that yes they might

243
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,359
have to upgrade in order to meet certain

244
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,039
limits of detections if those are

245
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,720
changed or even certain um let's say

246
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,799
potency if they force you to look at the

247
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,519
spectra you may have to get a different

248
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,039
detector if you have a uv vis uh you

249
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,039
cannot do that but you may have to go to

250
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,879
a diode array detector to look at you

251
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,519
know the wavelength several wavelengths

252
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,879
of cannabinoids

253
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,078
yeah and you touched on a good point

254
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,919
there is

255
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,838
is it on the table that some of the

256
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,919
actual

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,680
requirements or regulations might change

258
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,838
as well are you going to potentially

259
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,958
have to be looking for new pesticides

260
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,040
new microbials things like that

261
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,159
you know i'm really hoping that they

262
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,000
will

263
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,919
what is really of concern is the

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,078
category one pesticides

265
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,719
that currently essentially allows the

266
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,639
labs to set their own limits of

267
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,399
detection now the state does say you

268
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,759
have to get to

269
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
0.1

270
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,319
milligram per gram but essentially

271
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,120
allows labs to set as high as that and

272
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,519
others who are perhaps more concerned

273
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,200
about consumer safety or perhaps

274
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,200
are utilizing the sensitivity of their

275
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,360
instruments are

276
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,000
validating accordingly and doing the

277
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,639
statistical analysis to arrive at a set

278
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,919
lod q based on

279
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,000
what they've done with matrix

280
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,679
interference and whatnot but then there

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,519
are just other labs who may take

282
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,799
advantage of that situation

283
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,278
and um

284
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,319
push that limit as far as possible

285
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,720
so it creates this uneven playing ground

286
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,480
in the industry where

287
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,759
you know i'm sure we'll touch on this it

288
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,480
kind of allows for lab shopping based on

289
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,559
whose loq is here who's lod is here if

290
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,639
my sample passes one lab it's gonna fail

291
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,639
at the other lab so hey i'm gonna go

292
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,600
here and that's what we're trying to

293
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,078
avoid

294
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,959
having that sort of um

295
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,439
uneven playground and just caring more

296
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,199
about consumer safety and and making it

297
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
uh standard that's where i would assume

298
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,640
the state would go

299
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,879
after things like that

300
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,639
right so yeah maybe it's a good point we

301
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,679
should kind of set the table here and

302
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,000
talk about

303
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,159
the reason why the state's looking to to

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
standardize and that is for the most

305
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,958
part to

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,120
to

307
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,319
tackle this whole issue of variability

308
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,440
between

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,600
lab results and which can lead to as you

310
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,600
said lab shopping so people who aren't

311
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,680
familiar with that term maybe um you

312
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,040
could explain it a bit and then i'd also

313
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,919
like to

314
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,799
ask you kind of how pervasive is lab

315
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,278
shopping is it as common as

316
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,799
we we hear it is

317
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,000
yeah you know

318
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,639
lab shopping really is around

319
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,320
um certain manufacturers

320
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,079
um there's about i believe there's about

321
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,920
43 i want to say 43 labs in the state

322
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,278
currently i might be wrong on that

323
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,719
because you know new ones are getting

324
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,399
added daily um but essentially it it's

325
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,920
great right there's competition there's

326
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,278
options but because there is no standard

327
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,159
um

328
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,799
way or standard methodology folks would

329
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,399
go out to you know i might have a a

330
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,000
certain flower maybe i use the west side

331
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,278
maybe i didn't i'm gonna send it out to

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
five labs

333
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,639
um they're all gonna come back given

334
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,759
we're dealing with an agricultural

335
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,799
product

336
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,639
they're all going to come back

337
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,078
differently potency is going to be a

338
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,560
little different

339
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,638
based on limited detection my pesticide

340
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,439
residue might pass or fail

341
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,879
so as a manufacturer

342
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,200
i'm going to

343
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:16,159
you know probably go with the lab that

344
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,000
is uh most likely to pass me based on

345
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,278
whatever standards they've set for

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,200
themselves

347
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,159
and i really think the problem with lab

348
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,040
shopping is um

349
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,399
it's it's many factors fold uh issues in

350
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,199
many ways so

351
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,480
for one it does force competition in a

352
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,079
detrimental way where all parties lose

353
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,879
i look at it this way

354
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,919
first of all the consumer loses right as

355
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:45,039
a lab may falsify results leading to

356
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:47,360
higher uh higher prices for sub potent

357
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,679
products and perhaps even false negative

358
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,360
products where a contaminant is being

359
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,559
put out there so consumers are living in

360
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,320
that and

361
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,479
the buyers and the dispensary lose

362
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,760
because they're paying more for inflated

363
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,360
values if a lab is cheating on potency

364
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,120
the regulators lose because essentially

365
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,240
they lose control of that process if

366
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,480
they don't have a standardized method

367
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,278
the labs themselves lose right as

368
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,720
there's a race to the bottom on pricing

369
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,958
we all know inflation is rising

370
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,360
consumables are higher test costs

371
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,638
unfortunately seem to go lower you know

372
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,959
everything in the world is going higher

373
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,039
but somehow test costs seem to be going

374
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,198
lower which doesn't make sense right

375
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,278
competition is great but they're losing

376
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,399
in that way

377
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,919
the employees lose work as

378
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,000
you know a race to the bottom is causing

379
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,000
laps now shut down as they can remain

380
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,919
competitive they cannot afford to pay

381
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,320
employees you know of course what

382
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,919
happens the taxpayers lose because

383
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,480
people go unemployment unemployment

384
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,039
increases it's just slippery slope you

385
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,480
can see how it really isn't great for

386
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,919
anybody to allow this to continue

387
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,600
absolutely and in terms of

388
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,679
shopping

389
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,600
is it mostly around potency numbers is

390
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,399
it brown contamination is it a little

391
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,159
bit of both or is there sort of a test

392
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,600
that that folks are shopping for more

393
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,919
than others

394
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,879
well personally i can tell you that i

395
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:14,240
see it a lot around potency

396
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,399
where folks are sending in samples and

397
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,159
you are doing your best to give

398
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,120
um a high

399
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,759
quality controlled result and folks are

400
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,159
saying hey well lab b

401
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,399
is giving me 10 points higher on it so

402
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:32,639
you get a flower in and you're testing

403
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,799
at 19 but lab b is testing it at 27

404
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,320
which clearly doesn't make sense now yes

405
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,278
there's arguments around hey it's an

406
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,360
agricultural product is it a top nug is

407
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,439
it a bottom was it outdoor was it indoor

408
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,079
you know you know there's variances but

409
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,440
those sort of variances are highly

410
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,039
unlikely

411
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,560
um so

412
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,958
yeah

413
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,399
sort of in addition to that i mean at

414
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,838
least here locally we're out in

415
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,958
massachusetts we're kind of seeing some

416
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,079
thc numbers get up in the realm of

417
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,159
the very unlikely like a friend of mine

418
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:10,159
recently texted me and said that there

419
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:14,319
is a dispensary that had a bud on the on

420
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,360
their menu that was 47 thc

421
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,879
which

422
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,039
i mean you tell me

423
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:22,559
does that seem likely

424
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,919
so you know as far as flour that is a

425
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,919
flat

426
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,958
what do you want to call it just just a

427
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,519
lie that seems highly unlikely i don't

428
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,679
care how great your growing conditions

429
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,360
are but now you starting to push a limit

430
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,719
of what the plants could produce 47 thc

431
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,480
that would mean

432
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,519
thc a would have been at least 13

433
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,320
higher

434
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,399
um i mean now you're just beginning to

435
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,199
push the limits of what's possible

436
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,278
and and would really do see that a lot

437
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,479
you know we we really do see

438
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:59,600
um i've done some sort of um

439
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,839
round robin testing uh with some venable

440
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,000
labs where we've sent

441
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,078
some samples out right flower

442
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,679
homogenized flower and what's been

443
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,438
interesting some some some of them know

444
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,439
about it some don't but what's been

445
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,400
interesting is

446
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,959
all other cannabinoid numbers would line

447
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:22,000
up within one to two percent except thca

448
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,759
um for certain labs would be 10 points

449
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,759
higher i'm talking about i would get 20

450
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,078
they would get 30. or or the last would

451
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,440
get 20 something left to get 30. so it

452
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,119
kind of begs the question when you're

453
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
looking at about 10 different

454
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,798
cannabinoids and they're all lining up

455
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,798
but one

456
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,200
why is lab b

457
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,519
of sudden 10 points higher on this one

458
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,840
compound but all the other compounds are

459
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,000
spot on with everybody else i mean

460
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,639
that's a clear indication of inflating

461
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,640
potency for flour based on that of

462
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,679
course those labs will not do it based

463
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,759
on an edible delta 9 knowing that well

464
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,280
if you if manufacturer gives you a 10

465
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,599
milligram edible you know you're not

466
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,119
going to give them back a result of 15

467
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,678
milligrams right it doesn't quite work

468
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,798
out or 20 milligrams but you can on

469
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,320
flour

470
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,240
and they build in this unscrupulous work

471
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,960
and this is what we see of course we

472
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,200
would lose business because well

473
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,600
lab b does give them that number

474
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
and unfortunately not much we as labs

475
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,000
can really do about it you know the

476
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,519
owners is really on the state to enforce

477
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,679
some of those things um from happening

478
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,519
yeah and i have to imagine that a lot of

479
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,880
this is based too on the fact that

480
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,798
consumers

481
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,080
really look to that thc number as the

482
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,759
indicator of quality for the cannabis um

483
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,319
i'm still waiting for the day when

484
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:43,919
that's not the case and that consumers

485
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:47,119
will will look at you know aroma or bag

486
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,480
appeal or just flavor more so than just

487
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,399
a raw thc number you know i totally you

488
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,000
and i both i think we've beat this thing

489
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,840
to death about hey it's not just about

490
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,319
that thc number as an indicator of

491
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,159
quality i mean cannabinoids or cannabis

492
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,918
depending on how you're using it um

493
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,160
really depends on a myriad of factors

494
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,480
you know we all talk about the

495
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,320
entourage effect and whatnot you know

496
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,640
there's turpin's effects and there's

497
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,038
been talk back when where people were

498
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,280
saying well you know this 12

499
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,079
flower from california knocks my socks

500
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,720
off and i get a 30 from nevada and it

501
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,240
doesn't do anything and it's like well

502
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,079
yeah because it's not just about the

503
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,240
numbers it doesn't mean that you know

504
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,639
the lab in the other state was cheating

505
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,720
but it's not just about that thc number

506
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,360
it's an entourage effect along with your

507
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,519
body as well your receptors and how

508
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,519
how those behave how

509
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,879
you your genetics are playing a factor

510
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,639
into it so

511
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,960
yeah it'd be great on the day when you

512
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,600
can really you know

513
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,600
look more to the science of other

514
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,599
compounds and not even just cannabinoids

515
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,439
but the whole set of compounds in

516
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,759
cannabis and how they play

517
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,759
with your receptors to really give you

518
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,759
you know certain relief that you're

519
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,440
looking for

520
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,679
well that end you know not all of us are

521
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,600
looking to get their our socks knocked

522
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,880
off either right you know when you

523
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,399
you're buying

524
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,159
alcohol you're not

525
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
going for everclear every time you're

526
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,320
you're going for a nice wine or

527
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,480
something like that so

528
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,439
one of these days it's gonna change this

529
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,599
week and we can only hope

530
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,440
uh so but talking about the variation

531
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,719
between labs and you know we've touched

532
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,558
on the fact that you know some labs

533
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,240
might be unscrupulous and kind of

534
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,960
inflating numbers but i was wondering if

535
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,120
you could talk about you know just

536
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,880
more natural variations whether it be

537
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,678
like you've touched upon before that the

538
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,080
plant is is not homogeneous and there's

539
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,440
going to be some some variation in the

540
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,079
plant itself

541
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,558
um but what about different instruments

542
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,319
different different reference standards

543
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,639
different things like that could could

544
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,558
those be be causing the variations as

545
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,400
well that we're observing

546
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,960
you know that's really a good point uh

547
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,000
that you brought up then yes so

548
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,120
um

549
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
when we talk about you know an

550
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,759
agricultural product that's grown acres

551
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,798
and you have lights hitting different

552
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,599
parts of it and and your nutrients uh

553
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:10,079
getting certain parts or or disease

554
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,319
hitting certain parts of it uh yeah your

555
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,199
cultivar would necessarily have the same

556
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,200
value homogenously throughout so there's

557
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,319
yeah lots of other factors that affect

558
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,440
that

559
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,000
honestly

560
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,080
it starts off in sampling even how you

561
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,880
sample the product right when you're

562
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,038
sampling for an assay are you

563
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,520
doing it in a statistically significant

564
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,640
manner are you picking evenly or you

565
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,960
only picking top-notch top nogs versus

566
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,720
you know smaller popcorn but you know

567
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,038
depending on what you're looking for

568
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,440
and then yes you get to the instrument

569
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,759
there is the issue with

570
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,798
manufacturer of your certified reference

571
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,400
material

572
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,240
right you have to

573
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,320
vet that very well make sure it's an

574
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,640
iso-created manufacturer and make sure

575
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,200
okay i've i done my due diligence and

576
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,200
make sure that this compound is at the

577
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,038
purity that they say it is and is it

578
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,600
stable enough because i've seen a

579
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,440
situation where we all know once you mix

580
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,759
this cannabinoids even in standards

581
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,279
together um interactions are some

582
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,119
interactions that begin to happen and

583
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,480
there is some breakdown

584
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,158
the carboxylation depending on your

585
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,159
storage condition and how many

586
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,320
cannabinoids are mixed together it's

587
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,919
unstable right so

588
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,279
the lab has to do the due diligence and

589
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,200
make sure they're storing their

590
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,200
standards correctly they're vetting

591
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,840
their vendor correctly and they're

592
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,279
calibrating correctly you know each of

593
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,918
the standards come with a certificate of

594
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,079
analysis just like we put out for the

595
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,720
public you have to look at that what is

596
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,199
the purity of my thca

597
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,600
does the vendor who did their work and

598
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,240
say hey we've done

599
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,359
the analysis and the period is really 90

600
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,599
percent so if i'm getting a 1000 ppm

601
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,918
standard um when you shoot it on your

602
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,798
instrument it's really 900

603
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,679
but

604
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,558
as an analyst am i typing in 1000 into

605
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,038
my

606
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,678
hplc that would be wrong right because

607
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,919
the vendor says this is a 1000 ppm

608
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,840
standard however based on the purity

609
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,759
it's really 900 so technically you

610
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,918
should be typing in 900 so you can see

611
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,919
how things start to get funny if even

612
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,200
the analysts may not be even

613
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,799
unscrupulous about it may just be

614
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,400
ignorant to that fact now they're

615
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:17,839
looking at coas

616
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,679
these are all things

617
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,279
we have to consider that adds to that

618
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,640
variability

619
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,558
right and all these things can kind of

620
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,280
come compound upon each other right and

621
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:29,279
kind of create even bigger variances

622
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,359
they really do i mean we talk about we

623
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,079
talk about methods of

624
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,719
measurement of uncertainty you know has

625
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,798
every lab really done this how your

626
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,679
pipette has an effect is was it

627
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,960
calibrated everything you do adds to

628
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,038
your measurement uncertainty so has

629
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,400
all the labs

630
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:49,919
necessarily

631
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,559
analyzed for the measure of uncertainty

632
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,320
what is that value how far away what is

633
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,079
the error that you expect per your

634
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,359
result you know we've talked about it

635
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,599
several different ways is that something

636
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,558
that should be reported on a coa should

637
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,558
you report your cannabinoid value as a

638
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,720
range rather than a single certified

639
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,480
value because technically a range makes

640
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,440
more sense and it's probably the most

641
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,360
accurate

642
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,600
now i get where folks wouldn't want that

643
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:16,879
right if i'm selling and i'm reporting

644
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,639
oh the sample is between 18 to 21

645
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,159
well i guess

646
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,038
there are certain folks who are selling

647
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,120
it that may not want that right but that

648
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,960
is the truth and is that something the

649
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,399
state should regulate you know i will

650
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,059
leave that up to the states to make a

651
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,038
decision

652
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:32,960
[Laughter]

653
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,400
yeah smart man

654
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,319
um

655
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,360
we're talking about standardization too

656
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,678
and

657
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,759
if the state's going to come out and and

658
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,440
dictate certain standards

659
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,679
do you think that that would potentially

660
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,558
stifle innovation that the labs need to

661
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,798
do

662
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,720
i know i've listened to

663
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,599
panels that you've been on on canmed

664
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,038
before and you've talked about how

665
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,719
it never surprises you the different

666
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,558
matrices that come through the door and

667
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,200
that each one is sort of a different as

668
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,158
a small science project to be able to

669
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,319
fully analyze it and

670
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,559
how would a standardization push like

671
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,079
this sort of prevent you from from doing

672
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,158
that

673
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,599
um you know great question

674
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,880
um honestly you gotta talk about what

675
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,079
the

676
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,600
the the rules are looking to standardize

677
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,439
right it depends really on what you're

678
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,599
attempting standardize uh we're talking

679
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,360
about homogenization are we talking

680
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,319
about the prep method talking about

681
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,079
sampling or the instrument method right

682
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,359
i think when we talk a lot about this a

683
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,678
lot of folks refer straight to the

684
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,918
instrument method but uh forget to

685
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,600
realize that those other parts play

686
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,559
probably a bigger role

687
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,399
in

688
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,240
the variability that we see

689
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,480
how how labs are homogenizing their

690
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,159
sample can make a huge difference you

691
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,640
know you're picking off uh kefir

692
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,840
material versus a homogenizing the whole

693
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,759
uh flower um you know

694
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,639
that has to be regulated

695
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,640
and yes i do believe if we head towards

696
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,360
you know some of maybe the instrument

697
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,278
method it is going to stifle innovation

698
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,439
you know you see labs out there as more

699
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,798
standards become available while we're

700
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,278
getting to analyze more and more

701
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,440
cannabinoids you see coas with you know

702
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,679
20 or more cannabinoids being analyzed

703
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,200
for this gives the consumer more

704
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,240
information

705
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,720
i think if you look at sb 544 you got to

706
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,960
ask the question is it referring to the

707
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,558
state reference lab adopting a standard

708
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,880
test or for all licensed labs being

709
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,798
forced to adopt a single method you know

710
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,559
it's all about interpretation

711
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,319
right um so

712
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:41,038
i think the intent of of the of the sb

713
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,798
544 is noble but if the goal is to

714
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,240
stabilize an agricultural products

715
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:47,038
potency

716
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,919
enforcement is really the way um i think

717
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,759
they need to head as rather rather than

718
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,840
try to

719
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,079
force labs to use a single method which

720
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,759
would stifle the innovation

721
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,158
even when you look at a

722
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,558
usp yes there are compendium methods out

723
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,600
there but it allows

724
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:08,480
also for each individual lab to be able

725
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,079
to validate a method per

726
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,919
the the the

727
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,439
criteria set forth by the regulating

728
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,880
body right so yes you can use my method

729
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,080
or if you don't or don't have that

730
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,679
instrument you can use this other

731
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,599
instrument but you have to validate

732
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,159
following this criteria

733
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,240
and that's where things might be a

734
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,960
little bit better and easier if the

735
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,200
state went that route right

736
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,278
um i you know honestly i think they need

737
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,360
to perform more on label round robins um

738
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,839
fro with with all different cannabinoids

739
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,519
to get the labs to align a little better

740
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,720
you know it should be within a 10

741
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,119
deviation

742
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,679
um it shouldn't be as far as what we're

743
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,558
seeing now up to 40 deviation

744
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,240
right

745
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,000
um

746
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,839
it shouldn't be able to only force labs

747
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,440
to analyze a certain subset of compounds

748
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,000
you know if they do this will they be

749
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,000
forcing you to analyze on the thc cbd

750
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,240
cbda cvga

751
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,319
you know what exactly will they

752
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,200
establish a list of compounds

753
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,038
so

754
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,960
again i'm really anxious to see you know

755
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,038
what kind of how to execute this how the

756
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,000
dc execute this and that'll really

757
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,359
determine the success of that program

758
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,200
yeah and so

759
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,439
would you

760
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,519
not necessarily support but would you

761
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,080
expect that the the state would

762
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,398
potentially do sort of a

763
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,558
a proficiency test where they kind of

764
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,558
homogenize a big batch and send it out

765
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,558
to all the labs and then see if

766
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,398
um what the variation is between the

767
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,278
results

768
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,199
uh most definitely i would expect that

769
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,038
uh something like nist has been doing

770
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,919
which you know we've been participating

771
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:43,599
in

772
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,080
for all the rounds where the homogenized

773
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,038
one and send it out but here's a problem

774
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,798
when

775
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,558
the state does this

776
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,240
if a lab is doing something unscrupulous

777
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,398
they know this and they know the right

778
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,240
way to do it so magically the state

779
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:59,199
numbers from all the labs are probably

780
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,880
going to align right right so i think

781
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,480
the statement is finally blinded or

782
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,320
something right it needs to be blinded

783
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,240
needs to be really blinded the cities

784
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,639
find a way to do this probably through

785
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,519
the

786
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,399
manufacturers or whoever they want to

787
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,879
use without the labs knowing and and

788
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,158
that will be the true test right if they

789
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,080
just send in some

790
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,799
manufacturer hey you know we're looking

791
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:23,199
to be a new client here's my uh product

792
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,480
we'll quickly find out which labs are

793
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,480
you know especially if you send them a

794
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,240
homogenized product that'll eliminate

795
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,240
the variability or at least reduce the

796
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,240
variability and then you can really see

797
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,240
who's um boosting numbers

798
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,399
absolutely and now

799
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,480
what do you think about producers and

800
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,798
manufacturers having their own in-house

801
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,558
testing um is that something that could

802
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,519
sort of help

803
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,599
um regulate or or stifle some of this

804
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,879
lab shopping

805
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,359
yeah you know

806
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,559
i've worked with a few

807
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:59,359
producers that do that um and some of

808
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,558
the best ones work directly with the lab

809
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,479
and say hey

810
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:05,839
we're going to develop this relationship

811
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,399
i have an hplc in-house

812
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,240
here's my method let me see your method

813
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,558
let's get on the same page

814
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,720
and then you begin to analyze together

815
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,960
and look at the school analysis the

816
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,919
differences in your methodologies and

817
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,159
you come to some sort of

818
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,960
consensus in what you're doing and those

819
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,720
folks get you know um

820
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,360
they would do their in-house and they

821
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,360
will be directly in line with what is

822
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,079
expected because they wouldn't have to

823
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,519
necessarily depend or go lab shopping

824
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,158
but there are some considerations when

825
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,879
you want to do something like this you

826
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,240
know

827
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,559
for one you should follow some kind of

828
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,640
strict qaqc procedures

829
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,319
uh with your third-party lab

830
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,960
and it's important that you're aligned

831
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,200
with who your crm vendor is

832
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,679
even so many consumables

833
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,200
the method is it standardized even the

834
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,640
instrument they're using you know the

835
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,240
labs have to get

836
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,120
preventive maintenance done every so

837
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,159
often

838
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,000
i would

839
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,320
expect the producer to do the same with

840
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,319
their instrument and even more

841
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,960
importantly qualified personnel to run

842
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,119
it

843
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,519
because again this is not like uh you

844
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,359
know just a plug and play oh let me do

845
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,599
this like like you mentioned before a

846
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,798
little bit before um every day is a

847
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,558
little experiment as you get these

848
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:19,839
different matrices in and you need to

849
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:21,759
have somebody who's qualified to

850
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,558
understand what they're dealing with

851
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,319
to be able to think on their feet and

852
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,079
understand when things go

853
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,759
out of whack or

854
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,918
or really understand the instrument

855
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,798
itself so yes i think it's a great thing

856
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,120
that folks should be doing um but it has

857
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,480
to be in line with how the lab tests as

858
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,239
well

859
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,079
yeah and that's a good point when you

860
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,558
when you talk about just

861
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,879
you know competency competency of the

862
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,759
lab techs and you said that you know

863
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,440
there's 40 plus labs in california and

864
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,359
as we know cannabis is a very

865
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,278
complicated matrix with a lot of

866
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,519
different compounds and

867
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,398
pesticides that have similar molecular

868
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,519
weights to the compounds and

869
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,918
you know

870
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,599
not that you need to name any names but

871
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,600
how much of this variation could come

872
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:11,038
down to just you know either whether it

873
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:13,038
be inexperience or incompetency as well

874
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,879
oh you know that that is a very good

875
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:19,519
question and i don't know if we'll ever

876
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,720
find out i feel like um it's complex

877
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,880
however

878
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,200
um cheating is easy

879
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,559
right i i think folks hire some pretty

880
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,200
intelligent folks um um and cheating is

881
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,879
really easy cheating consistently is not

882
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,278
easy right and that's where you start to

883
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,039
weed out uh those labs and we've seen

884
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,278
all kinds of stories and the headlines

885
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,558
of you know recalls and labs doing this

886
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,480
and that

887
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,639
um so i think um a lot of it i wouldn't

888
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
chalk it up to

889
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,600
competency there's a

890
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,640
percentage of it i do chuck it up to

891
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,038
direct negligence um on either the

892
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,399
analyst the the lab

893
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,798
ownership management staff it's it's

894
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:05,038
it's intent right of course it's hard to

895
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,319
prove intent but i think you know if you

896
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:07,278
look in the right places you can see

897
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,558
that

898
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,159
um and and that's what unfortunately

899
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,720
really bothers me

900
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,480
in that with with this

901
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,640
competition that's happening is not

902
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,360
being regulated in the right way and we

903
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,720
cannot expect the lab to be you know the

904
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,558
regulators um i think the state needs to

905
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,440
listen when when folks do tell them

906
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,038
about potential issues and they should

907
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,159
do the due diligence and they've done

908
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,158
great i know

909
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,640
you know 43 laps across the state or

910
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,480
more and you know so many staff in the

911
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,799
state to be able to handle this they've

912
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,519
done a great job you know doing their uh

913
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,599
their own audits and whatnot but you

914
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,038
know maybe there's some better ways to

915
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,798
make it a little bit

916
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,640
easier to weed out some of this

917
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,398
unscrupulous players

918
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,120
and you know that's always something of

919
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,918
course i'm i'm willing to help if needed

920
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,398
um i think we all need to

921
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,559
be the beacon in this industry you know

922
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:05,199
like somebody once said all boats rise

923
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,200
in the tide and and california is set an

924
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,398
example

925
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,800
excellent

926
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,000
all right so so winding down here and

927
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,000
forgive me but i'm going to put you on

928
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,239
the spot a little bit

929
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,199
so it sounds like i mean you're in

930
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,759
support of of standardization and this

931
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,398
push here obviously probably with some

932
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,679
caveats too like that you know there's a

933
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,838
certain

934
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,079
um level that you're you're willing to

935
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,639
go to so so what is that so say i'm

936
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,480
putting you in charge of standardization

937
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,200
of labs in california

938
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,199
um how would you do it

939
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,638
oh wow yeah you definitely put me on the

940
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,519
spot

941
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,639
i wasn't ready for that one um no but

942
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,199
honestly

943
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,720
how would i do it um i would kind of

944
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,799
follow usb's footsteps you set out some

945
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,279
or work you know not just usb but work

946
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,119
with aoac work with astm with some of

947
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,440
those companion methods out there make

948
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,920
sure it's modern first of all you know

949
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,480
nobody wants to work with a method that

950
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,358
is using uh some ink blood tests or

951
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,519
whatever

952
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:11,920
but yeah um really look at okay

953
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,519
if you want to analyze cannabinoids you

954
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,240
can say

955
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,320
give a myriad of detectors you should

956
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,519
use a myriad of instrument types you

957
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,320
should use and i'm talking about you

958
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,559
know hplc or lcms i'm not talking about

959
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,760
manufacturer specific instruments

960
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,599
um

961
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,480
a column specification

962
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,320
right

963
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,358
some mobile phases there are certain

964
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:37,039
parameters i would say this should be

965
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:39,039
followed and each lab would essentially

966
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,838
could have a couple options

967
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:45,039
um you have to be able to replicate the

968
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,400
standardized method and you can have

969
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,559
your own

970
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,760
innovative method as well

971
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,119
right so

972
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,280
and those two

973
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,680
based on whatever analytes you're

974
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,519
looking at should match

975
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:02,879
right so if i randomly send you a sample

976
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:05,358
and i say run it on you know the the

977
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,440
your your standardized method and your

978
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,440
own innovative method you should come up

979
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,200
with the same results that's how we do

980
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,159
it have the labs sort of maintain

981
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,159
a state reference method and they can

982
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,480
you know report on their own method

983
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,440
based on a validation that meets the

984
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,679
criteria that was set forth so

985
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,880
validation is important as well set

986
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:31,440
specific criteria and specific uh ways

987
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,720
reference fda or

988
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,559
or whatever other organization

989
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,078
you would like to reference as far as

990
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,519
validation

991
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,440
parameters

992
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,159
and enforce that

993
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,480
secondarily continue having blind

994
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,399
round robin sent out

995
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,358
randomly throughout the year to make

996
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,519
sure that labs are in line conduct a

997
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:54,480
more regular audit and audit the

998
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:57,039
different

999
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,440
areas of the lab not just you know a

1000
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,039
certain essay or certain

1001
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,960
personnel

1002
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,320
or instrument but

1003
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,240
keep it fresh

1004
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,760
right this is how you keep people on

1005
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,879
their toes this is how you keep people

1006
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,200
honest

1007
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,920
that's really what i would focus on

1008
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,399
and

1009
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,240
additionally you know the potency thing

1010
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,639
is a huge issue

1011
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,118
but i'm more concerned about contaminant

1012
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,118
levels

1013
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,359
making sure that labs are not putting

1014
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,358
things out there that folks that could

1015
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,838
be detrimental to folks health

1016
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,159
right that's very important you know

1017
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,679
yeah they can play the potency game but

1018
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,598
when you start messing around with

1019
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:36,879
instrument limited detection to pass

1020
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,640
things that perhaps shouldn't be out

1021
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,079
there for you know we always talk about

1022
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,838
immunocompromised patients but it's not

1023
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,960
just about them it has to be the entire

1024
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:44,559
population

1025
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,800
whether i'm immunocompromised or not

1026
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,279
doesn't mean i want to smoke a product

1027
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,599
full of chlorphenipia or or middle

1028
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,519
corporate right

1029
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,920
nobody really knows how this affects

1030
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,280
your body based on the route of

1031
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,280
administration

1032
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,280
so that has to be of utmost importance

1033
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,119
to the state and i guess that's what i

1034
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,680
would really focus on

1035
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,960
finding innovative and efficient ways to

1036
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:08,000
enforce

1037
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,559
while

1038
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,960
enforcing on

1039
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,279
modes of validation

1040
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,280
i think as opposed to trying to stick a

1041
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,160
lab to say oh only analyze this four

1042
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,640
cannabinoids by diode array detector and

1043
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,078
and that'll be the standardization

1044
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:25,519
right

1045
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,160
all right well you handled the question

1046
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,400
