00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,080
good morning everybody thank you for

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,400
being here

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,719
and i would like to say

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,679
thank you to medicinal genomics for

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,439
bringing us all together

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,278
i know that the pandemic has been a

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,920
little wonky actually the whole world

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,000
has gone wonky on us lately

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,679
and i would like to thank our panelists

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,278
for being here today in making this

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,920
journey

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,480
so we are in a wonky world and i would

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,559
invite you to think about our colleagues

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,880
friends and family who are undergoing

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,000
some challenges in eastern europe these

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,679
days so

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,679
when you have time later in the day just

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,600
take a moment pause and

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,359
and give them some thought

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
they don't have the opportunity that we

21
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,719
all have right now today

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
and

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,840
my heart goes out to them

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,759
so regulating cannabis is not

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,160
straightforward and it is most

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,759
definitely not consistent across north

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,358
america and definitely not within the

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,320
united states

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,799
as individual states are slowly and i do

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,680
mean slowly and independently legalizing

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,880
cannabis it's often defined as hemp

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
marijuana

33
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,879
cannabis all of this other stuff

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,118
mentioned to somebody yesterday that

35
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,798
cannabis is still in its infancy stage

36
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,959
we haven't even identified our

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,310
vocabulary yet

38
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,798
um

39
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,359
[Music]

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,280
all of the regulating bodies and other

41
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,000
interested parties have one goal in mind

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,079
and that is to ensure consumer safety

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,319
that's the one central thought and one

44
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,839
central objective to all of the parties

45
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,359
working together

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,680
and without getting into the history of

47
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,000
the legalizations

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,000
or the lessons learned or the lessons

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,239
not learned thus far

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,359
on the pathways forward i am delighted

51
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:50,078
to introduce you today today's panel

52
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,399
that represents regulations and

53
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,639
mostly around laboratory testing

54
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,118
and a snapshot into the science that's

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,599
been diligently working towards

56
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,359
catching up to regulations

57
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,679

175
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,639
postdoc training in molecular genetics

176
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:11,038
his primary responsibility at medicinal

177
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,199
genomics is to make recommendations to

178
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,439
regulatory officials that are tasked

179
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,680
with either drafting and or modifying

180
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,240
cannabis hemp and psychedelic mushroom

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,918
required microbial testing regs to

182
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,199
ensure safe products for patients and

183
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,439
consumers

184
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,520
previously he was at the department of

185
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,759
new jersey department of health and

186
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,839
public health and environmental labs

187
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,680
where he led teams that started the

188
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,599
cannabis testing lab the cannabis

189
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,600
microbial testing unit and created a

190
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,319
compendium of allstate

191
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,319
medical cannabis required testing

192
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,879
regulations database

193
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,720
so that's our panel and as for me among

194
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,639
other hats i serve as the science

195
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,720
advisor to the cannabis

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,598
analytical science program which is the

197
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,319
cannabis division of aoec international

198
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,240
which is an independent nonprofit

199
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,439
non-governmental science organizations

200
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,199
that's been

201
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,639
vetting and publishing testing standards

202
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,360
for more than 130 years and the casp is

203
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,598
very exciting and on behalf of the aoac

204
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,280
team we welcome the input and engagement

205
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,839
of scientists laboratories and

206
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,598
governmental agencies several of whom

207
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,478
are on the panel today

208
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,680
and

209
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,120
we're going to start with the panel

210
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,639
discussion with some questions and then

211
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
open the floor to questions from the

212
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,360
audience

213
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,720
and i invite your engagement and look

214
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,560
forward to some dynamic discussions

215
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,800
so when we think about where are we

216
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,038
today and what are we doing i have a

217
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,280
question for jenny

218
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,639
what regulatory checkpoints exist to

219
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,638
protect consumer safety

220
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,598
hi good morning everyone

221
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,840
um

222
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,759
on behalf of the uh speaking for the

223
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,758
department of cannabis control in

224
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,319
california

225
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,319
we've built in a lot of the

226
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,479
like safety and regulatory checkpoints

227
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,039
into our auditing and inspection program

228
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,800
for our licensed facilities i oversee

229
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,038
the inspection program for the

230
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,960
cultivation

231
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,079
facilities throughout the state as well

232
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,638
as the la and central california

233
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,399
manufacturing licensees

234
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,598
so we look at things like like you would

235
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,120
imagine for

236
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,159
an audit or a health and safety

237
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,519
inspection

238
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,120
we look for things like master

239
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,839
manufacturing protocols other good

240
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,800
manufacturing practices sops solvent

241
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,318
purity and food safety whenever

242
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,038
when the facility is

243
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
creating edibles so we look at various

244
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,240
health and safety checkpoints in that

245
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,240
way our team of environmental scientists

246
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,440
goes uh does a really detailed audit

247
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,519
because you know knowing that um a large

248
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,279
portion of you know the public

249
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,120
that consumes these products you know

250
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,120
our patients and may have compromised

251
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,399
immune systems so we keep that in mind

252
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
when we're doing when we're doing these

253
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,839
really detailed um inspections at the

254
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,278
cultivation sites we look for pesticides

255
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,760
to make sure that the

256
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,278
pesticides are on an approved list and

257
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,958
they're not you know

258
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,200
banned pesticides or anything like that

259
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,278
and and that the list that they've

260
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,600
declared at licensure matches what we

261
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,120
find on site

262
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,278
so there's a lot of different regulatory

263
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,320
checkpoints there

264
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:19,120
if we if and when we find deficiencies

265
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,600
depending on the severity

266
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,720
we use a progressive discipline

267
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,278
process you know working closely with

268
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
licensees unless it's an immediate

269
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,159
danger to

270
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,600
life and health

271
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,360
if it's a contaminated product we can

272
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
initiate a recall process which happened

273
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,200
recently we had our first mandatory

274
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,800
recall

275
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
and you know we work really closely with

276
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,599
our licensees who acted really swiftly

277
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,800
um with us to to recall the uh the

278
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,360
products

279
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,958
um if it's uh

280
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,320
if it's something that's an immediate

281
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,000
danger to

282
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,200
like occupational safety for example

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
like an

284
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,839
unregistered uh extraction unit that may

285
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,720
be a combustion risk we work with fire

286
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,800
department to rent that red tag that

287
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,040
that piece particular piece of equipment

288
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,919
make sure it's not being used

289
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,639
and that's more on the you know serious

290
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,159
uh violation side if it's um or minor

291
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,919
moderate like

292
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,399
they didn't post their license you know

293
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,879
um in a visible area of course it's just

294
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,879
uh it's just a matter of notif uh just a

295
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,480
notification to the licensee saying you

296
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,480
need to post your license great thank

297
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,000
you very much jenny i appreciate that

298
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,759
sounds like you guys are busy out there

299
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,600
in dcc

300
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:31,200
um heather question for you

301
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,720
we have two we have representation from

302
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,240
two different states california and

303
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,079
colorado can you tell us what camera is

304
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,240
and what are the objectives of that

305
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,239
organization sure

306
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,959
a camera is the cannabis regulators

307
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,959
association and um currently camera has

308
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,518
about 40 different member states i think

309
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,838
so essentially every state that has

310
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,480
legalized cannabis in some form

311
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,399
primarily medical or adult youth but

312
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,680
agencies that have hemp programs are

313
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,839
also represented within canberra

314
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,919
and what's nice about camera is the the

315
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,320
primary regulatory body is usually the

316
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,240
the main member but if your state

317
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,720
chooses to have full membership in

318
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,200
camera any of your state agencies that

319
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,759
touch cannabis in any way can

320
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,320
join in the discussion so even things

321
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,159
like our department of education

322
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,680
or department of public safety that you

323
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,278
know just as law enforcement they can

324
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,879
all be members of the organization to

325
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,600
share information

326
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,799
and canada's main goal really is to

327
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,600
be a source for regulators to

328
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,439
discuss uh best practices to discuss

329
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,480
lessons learned

330
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
and to to share

331
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,919
i guess our experiences with each other

332
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,680
in trying to regulate cannabis so that

333
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,159
in the end one of the primary you know

334
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,078
goals there is that can rule will be a

335
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,639
forum to promote standardization and

336
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,000
harmonization in regulations um across

337
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,600
the country

338
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
um obviously there are challenges with

339
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,480
that um as each state undergoes their

340
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,639
own law making processes and regulatory

341
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
development processes uh which is why we

342
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,039
do probably see so much disparity in

343
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,200
state regs but camera is this recently

344
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,679
organized group um that is really hoping

345
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,800
to to bring some of that harmonization

346
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,359
it also intends to serve as a group that

347
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,278
can help educate others so again that

348
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,879
could be educating federal lawmakers so

349
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,159
as we look at you know possible federal

350
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,159
legalization

351
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,278
state lessons can be shared with the

352
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,159
feds

353
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,000
um

354
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,319
and and also to be kind of you know

355
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,639
partners with industry to again share

356
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,160
information both ways and learn how and

357
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,320
understand how the regulations really

358
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,439
affect the industry um there are

359
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,519
certainly goals that as this is all um

360
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,200
developed that public health and safety

361
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,959
and consumer safety

362
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,079
equity and all

363
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,719
and other things are really at the

364
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,120
forefront of the work of camera

365
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,440
thank you very much and it's so nice to

366
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,759
hear that that states are beginning to

367
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,000
form and union not unionized but

368
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,159
harmonize and centralize so thank you

369
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,240
very much um and i'm assuming that

370
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,240
colorado and california

371
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,399
are both part of the organization

372
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,360
awesome that's great and

373
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
katie

374
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
um

375
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,959
what prompted the national science i'm

376
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,200
sorry the national um

377
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,319
safety

378
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,720
council's involvement with cannabis

379
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,519
sir so the national safety council like

380
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,278
susan mentioned is 120 year old

381
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,278
organization focused on

382
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,839
workforce safety

383
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,600
both in the workplace and on the road

384
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,320
and so as canada's legalization began

385
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,519
affecting employers we

386
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,839
have about 53 000 membership member

387
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,000
organizations and we issued a survey to

388
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,120
them kind of asking what are your

389
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,679
concerns about employees and

390
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,198
your organizations as is cannabis

391
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,879
affecting

392
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,000
workplace safety and how are you

393
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,639
addressing it

394
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,278
so what we heard from them was that they

395
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,399
needed help they needed education and

396
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:07,519
they needed resources in order to

397
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,919
educate their employees and develop

398
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,879
really evidence-based policy

399
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,799
and so we partnered

400
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,439
with a few different organizations to

401
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,439
develop a project to look at how states

402
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,920
are regulating

403
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,320
regulating products and hope to come out

404
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,240
with the resource this year

405
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,879
really to do what heather was talking

406
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,839
about and really just provide education

407
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,000
as others are legalizing and

408
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,720
regulating cannabis to learn the best

409
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,879
practices and lessons learned from other

410
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,360
states and organizations

411
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,159
thank you very much so there you have it

412
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,959
nsc and i'm expecting that we're going

413
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,240
to have a lot more interaction from nfc

414
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,599
moving forward

415
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,159
and this will be terrific so this is a

416
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,519
really quick snapshot into where we are

417
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,399
and and how we

418
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,159
and and where we're hoping to go

419
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,759
um but now how do we

420
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,198
how did we get here

421
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,198
so let me ask you kay um

422
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,278
what were your challenges when you were

423
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,519
when you were facing state regulators

424
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,639
trying to develop a comprehensive

425
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,278
testing requirements

426
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,440
thank you it's a great question um and i

427
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,679
am talking here today

428
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,680
as a former cannabis regulator rather

429
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,559
than on behalf of my current employer so

430
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,479
i should make that clear but um can you

431
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,159
speak into them thank you

432
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,560
reminding me that i'm short

433
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,559
thank you

434
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,759
so when we were working with the

435
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,480
department of public health in

436
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,320
massachusetts in 2015

437
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,560
we were trying to develop a

438
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,600
comprehensive testing regulation and

439
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,119
typically

440
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,360
uh to be honest

441
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,600
when we were trying to develop

442
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,959
any kind of regulations govern governing

443
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,519
cannabis

444
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,198
we would look to the west and we would

445
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,799
look to the examples that were set by

446
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,919
colorado and california so it's very

447
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,679
nice to be on

448
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,319
uh the panel with representatives of

449
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,319
those two great states today but with

450
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
regard to trying to do comprehensive

451
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,720
testing regulations in that particular

452
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,879
year they were just themselves getting

453
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,600
into it at that time so what we were

454
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,078
faced with was a lack of federal

455
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,079
resources to look at because cannabis

456
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:24,159
was illegal and still is at the federal

457
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,319
level but also a lack of

458
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,240
prior

459
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,600
comprehensive regulations in the more

460
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,480
mature markets and the problem that we

461
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,920
had

462
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,680
in addition to the fact that we didn't

463
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,759
have anything to copy from is that when

464
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,838
you are looking at policy makers who are

465
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,480
addressing cannabis regulations not only

466
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,360
then but today their resumes look more

467
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,360
like mine than they look like the uh

468
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,360
more scientifically oriented members of

469
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,759
this panel or indeed the members of this

470
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,440
audience so we are challenged not only

471
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,839
in the fact that we didn't have

472
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,320
resources to draw on but we ourselves

473
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,880
were not conversant with the

474
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,079
matter that we were trying to regulate

475
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,759
so it was

476
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:08,240
extremely difficult we needed to draw on

477
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,000
experts within the government itself but

478
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,160
then also

479
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,078
request help from the outside

480
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
organizations and one of the things i

481
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,359
would encourage

482
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,558
folks in the audience today is to get

483
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,719
involved

484
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,439
as much as you can understanding that

485
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,439
your time is limited

486
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,600
states need to hear exactly what heather

487
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,679
was referring to earlier how the

488
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,599
regulations are affecting industry and

489
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,200
if you're seeing a problem

490
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,359
please do try and explain what it is so

491
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,679
that regulators can try to adjust it

492
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,558
it's very difficult when the

493
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,400
stakeholders in a particular environment

494
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,960
are not communicating with each other

495
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,919
and instead are siloed

496
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,000
it's not a productive way to proceed so

497
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,480
to the extent you can please provide

498
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,480
comment and explain to regulators where

499
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,960
you believe that something needs to be

500
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,519
addressed rather than

501
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,600
confining your comment to publications

502
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,558
that we may not read

503
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:11,119
i think that would be incredibly helpful

504
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,119
until such time as

505
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:15,038
camera and other organizations like it

506
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,959
with the help of national safety council

507
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,038
managed to achieve a more uniform

508
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,480
standardized environment

509
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,599
i think communication between the

510
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,759
different stakeholders in this

511
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,879
environment needs to increase otherwise

512
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,160
we are going to be left with this

513
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,600
patchwork

514
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,120
that we currently have in the different

515
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,159
states

516
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,119
thank you

517
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,880
thank you

518
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,359
and okay i'm just going to follow up on

519
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,520
one one more thing with you on that

520
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,678
and that is as a regulator from the

521
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:43,119
commission perspective

522
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,120
i have heard in the past about muhammad

523
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,519
and the mountain

524
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,639
can you tell me what might be implied by

525
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,720
that

526
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,080
that was what i was referring to with

527
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,919
regard to making sure you're

528
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,839
communicating with the folks that are

529
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,200
regulating your environment especially

530
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,199
when you're dealing with new and

531
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,240
emerging markets

532
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,919
in colorado california and massachusetts

533
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,000
at this point in

534
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,960
our market development we likely have

535
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,720
scientific staff that can advise us and

536
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,640
help us but when you're starting out

537
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,798
like i did with not only the medical

538
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
program but the adult use program you

539
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,558
may not have access to that kind of

540
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,720
resources in the timeline that you are

541
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,558
given either by the legislature or by

542
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,200
the citizens in a ballot initiative to

543
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,440
get your program up and running so it is

544
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,279
very important for the stakeholders to

545
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,360
come to the regulators don't wait for

546
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,399
them to come to you please

547
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,399
get your thoughts on paper or

548
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,840
you know by way of testimony in front of

549
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,600
the regulators so they can understand

550
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,439
where you're coming from

551
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,038
thank you very much and sure you are um

552
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,400
a stakeholder right an industry

553
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,119
stakeholder here

554
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,120
and what successes or challenges or both

555
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,839
have you had in the cannabis regulatory

556
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,839
space

557
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,480
i would like to first of all tell you

558
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,798
a story

559
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,480
of how

560
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,038
difficult it was for me to make a

561
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,159
decision to to

562
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:12,960
to pivot from being a public servant

563
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:15,120
to being an industry stakeholder is that

564
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,558
i had

565
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,798
bumped into

566
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,440
at a conference a commissioner from a

567
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:24,879
particular state in a regulatory body

568
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,480
and i had some ideas or recommendations

569
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,120
or amend

570
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,759
amendments to their microbial testing

571
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,439
rules and that i said to this individual

572
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,599
that there were plenty

573
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,919
of individuals

574
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,558
or industry stakeholders in her state

575
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,720
that could advise

576
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,038
for amendments of the rules and she just

577
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,360
looked at me and she said

578
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,119
you know i don't listen to them

579
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,199
but i'm glad that i'm with medicinal

580
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,399
genomics the last

581
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,880
year now

582
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,600
and the challenges that i face

583
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,600
is that there's no federal legalization

584
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,439
and so therefore there's

585
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:05,279
38

586
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,000
sets of required microbial testing rules

587
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,440
and so one by one

588
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,159
i review

589
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,240
the test microbial testing rules i

590
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,400
identify

591
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:22,240
areas where we feel

592
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,038
to make recommendations to amend rules

593
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,038
based on scientific

594
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,240
principles

595
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,359
and the

596
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,519
and then

597
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,439
the second challenge is to open a

598
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,279
dialogue

599
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,720
a true dialogue

600
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,639
between

601
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,798
our organization

602
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,840
and the

603
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:46,480
regulatory body

604
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:49,519
officials concerning our recommendations

605
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,880
concerning the successes

606
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,879
to be very honest with you

607
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,720
for five months

608
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,679
submitted public comment to various

609
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,960
regulatory bodies in multiple states

610
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,960
and all i heard was

611
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:12,798
then something happened in november

612
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:16,319
and various dialogues have been opened

613
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:18,879
we've been able to dialogue with them

614
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,439
a particular example

615
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,360
in one particular state that i read the

616
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,400
allowable methods the issues the

617
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,399
challenges are allowable methods what

618
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,640
analytes to test

619
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,159
and the action levels

620
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,400
so one particular state i read

621
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,320
the action excuse me the allowable

622
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,960
methods

623
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:44,158
are

624
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,159
usp1111 and 2025 and i do understand

625
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,200
that at this

626
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,200
the start of this

627
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,678
you know cannabis you know industry

628
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,200
there were no standards and methods

629
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,200
and so

630
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,400
this is why this was

631
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
adopted

632
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,880
and so

633
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,880
but it also said plating only

634
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,039
and i have five decades of experience

635
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,120
all the way from plating systems through

636
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,640
qpcr

637
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,199
and to

638
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,120
sequencing and therefore

639
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,159
i communicated

640
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,798
that to them with a recommendation to be

641
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,320
open to the aoac

642
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,319
standards and methods

643
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,400
that have been certified and then

644
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,399
the director of that agency contacted us

645
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,720
and we've had been having open dialogue

646
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,720
concerning everything about their

647
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,000
their rules and that they are amending

648
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,278
the rules and

649
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,440
and

650
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,679
this is an example of one of

651
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,720
you know our successes and are multiple

652
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,559
states

653
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,798
and we've had success in terms of

654
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,918
opening the dialogue

655
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:00,558
thank you and and you brought up aoac

656
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,480
and actually for all of the panelists

657
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,480
here well most of the panelists here you

658
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,440
all have some involvement with the aoec

659
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,200
casp

660
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,840
sure what prompted you to get involved

661
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,759
with with aoac

662
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,519
i'm glad you asked that you asked me

663
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,960
that question susan i was absolutely not

664
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,918
aware

665
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,519
of aoec cast program i am glad that an

666
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,759
industry friend of mine alerted me

667
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,918
to the existence of this program because

668
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,240
i knew immediately it was necessary

669
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,360
standards and methods

670
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,798
so i reviewed the first year's progress

671
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,240
report

672
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,038
and to be honest i was aghast

673
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,079
at

674
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:44,000
the plan or the three targets

675
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,678
for the next year

676
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,679
the second year

677
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,080
so

678
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,400
with an open heart i simply communicated

679
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:55,439
to aoac officials that i wish to just

680
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,278
simply have a dialogue and to share

681
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,600
my understanding of the

682
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,558
microbial testing

683
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:05,759
well the entire testing space

684
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,960
but specifically microbial testing

685
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,558
space

686
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,558
and they agreed to the dialogue and i

687
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,119
simply explained

688
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,720
who i was and what i

689
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:20,158
my experience

690
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,038
i gave them my recommendations

691
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,480
and

692
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,119
that was it

693
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,240
and to my shock they invited me to be a

694
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:30,399
member of all four committees because of

695
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,120
the breadth of knowledge that i had

696
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,600
accumulated at the department of health

697
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,079
and i simply says well

698
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,678
one is enough and being a microbiologist

699
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,000
i joined

700
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,240
the working uh the microbial working

701
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,440
group and in the last two years we've

702
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,159
been able

703
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,960
to have standards and subsequently

704
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,240
methods for the detection of the four

705
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,120
pathogenic strains of aspergillus

706
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,120
as well as for sugar toxin producing e

707
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,759
coli and salmonella

708
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,558
and in the clinical literature

709
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:08,240
for salmonella and the four aspergillus

710
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:12,960
pathogens there are clinical

711
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,359
cases reported of persons

712
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,720
utilizing cannabis or medical cannabis

713
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,839
that have

714
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,278
had illnesses and also death

715
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,759
thank you for that

716
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,200
heather you're very involved with aoac

717
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:26,960
casp as well

718
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,798
um

719
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,120
i want to ask you to ask answering

720
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,119
questions about that but as you know

721
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,278
that organization is focused on

722
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,839
establishing standard test methods how

723
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,159
do you think that might affect

724
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:42,720
regulations or in in colorado or on

725
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,000
behalf of camera or any place else sure

726
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,000
sure

727
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
well i think um

728
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,119
you know i think one of the reasons we

729
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,600
got involved with casp was because we

730
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:54,000
have seen directly the need for

731
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,558
more standardization and test methods

732
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,159
across laboratories i truly think part

733
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,000
of the issue that we see

734
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,000
in variability in test results between

735
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,119
labs is because there are so many

736
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,440
different methodologies and

737
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,278
inconsistencies and methods being used

738
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,278
i do want to say though

739
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,640
when i when i'm talking about utilizing

740
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,640
more standard methods in cannabis

741
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,559
testing i am not necessarily advocating

742
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,159
that every lab should use the exact same

743
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,918
method

744
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,278
again i don't think that we want to

745
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,120
stifle innovation we don't want to

746
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:24,159
stifle growth in the science we want to

747
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,639
ensure that people are able to

748
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,200
do the best testing that they can to use

749
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,919
good science and cannabis is complicated

750
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,120
it itself is a complex matrix

751
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,120
and then we have all these different

752
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,798
product types and so one test may not

753
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,319
apply to everything

754
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,000
so when i say that i think the

755
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,519
development of standard test methods is

756
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,558
really important again i think that

757
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,720
means

758
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,480
development of methods that have been

759
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,399
put through a level of rigor that is

760
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,360
perhaps more than an individual lab can

761
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,918
do on their own so what aoac does is you

762
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,599
know they put out an smpr different

763
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,200
method developers can submit methods

764
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,439
they have to be proven to meet the

765
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,960
requirements of the smpr by an expert

766
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,240
review panel

767
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,480
and the method can be published for

768
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,079
first action and then before its final

769
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,919
action it has to go through multi-lab

770
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,918
studies to again be shown to be fit for

771
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,080
purpose and to be really reliable as a

772
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,080
method and i think having those types of

773
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,759
methods developed again will overall

774
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,359
benefit the the general science and the

775
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,200
cannabis industry

776
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,918
and i think as those things are

777
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,038
developed and regulators can look to

778
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,679
that process again of a really robust

779
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,398
science then it gives regulators the

780
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,000
ability to say like you know maybe maybe

781
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,079
i hope again i hope regulators don't say

782
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,798
you may only do this one thing

783
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,960
but um i hope that regulars will say

784
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,798
this has been proven if you you either

785
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,360
need to you know do this this thing that

786
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,679
has been proven or you have to at least

787
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,479
demonstrate that your process or your

788
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,159
method is equivalent or better

789
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,240
and so that's really why i think things

790
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,320
like aoac casp are really important in

791
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,480
the in the science space of cannabis

792
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,960
so i guess this will go back to both

793
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,679
heather you you heather as well as jenny

794
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,558
would you see these standards as being

795
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,880
um

796
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:08,000
supporting the regulatory efforts in

797
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,000
your respective states

798
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,480
i'll just i'll be brief and let jenny

799
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,278
talk but yeah absolutely again i think

800
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,960
um

801
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,798
you know it's again it's not

802
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,038
if anybody's ever participated in

803
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,519
legislative or regulatory development

804
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,038
what any individual person um who is

805
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,960
involved with these things thinks may be

806
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,240
best it doesn't always mean it works out

807
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,079
that way in the regulatory or

808
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,759
legislative process

809
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,599
but again if we want to make

810
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,440
evidence-based policy decisions if we

811
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,959
want to make things based in science we

812
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,640
have to have these standards and these

813
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,159
processes to look to if we don't have

814
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,679
them then how are we going to make those

815
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,080
decisions so again it doesn't always

816
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,360
mean that we're going to

817
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,158
always make the right choices in

818
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,558
regulations or policy but again having

819
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,360
the resource and the data and the facts

820
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,839
is extremely helpful thank you jenny do

821
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,278
you have anything to

822
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,278
add actually don't have purview over um

823
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,278
the laboratory side so i'm just going to

824
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,839
echo what heather said i agree it's it

825
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,079
may be not um

826
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,319
the same exact standards for for every

827
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,398
method but if it's been tested and shown

828
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,960
that it's rigorous enough absolutely

829
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,038
great thank you and jenny by the way i

830
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,960
understand that the california structure

831
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:19,519
recently changed from the bcc to the dcc

832
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,278
can you very briefly talk talk to us

833
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,480
about the differences and what prompted

834
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,599
that change

835
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,440
yeah actually

836
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:30,558
prior to july 12th there were three uh

837
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,720
licensing agencies for cannabis in

838
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,200
california there was the bcc the bureau

839
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,079
of cannabis control which oversaw

840
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,880
distribution and retail licenses

841
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,319
cal cannabis which was under the cdfa

842
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,039
the california department of food and

843
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:47,759
agriculture which oversaw cultivation

844
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:50,000
and my legacy agency was cdph and i was

845
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,679
from the manufacturing manufactured

846
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,480
cannabis safety branch and we oversaw

847
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,440
the manufacturers um come july 12th we

848
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,440
consolidated agencies into the uh into

849
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,320
the main department of cannabis controls

850
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,240
a new agency and that was really to

851
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,278
offer a better you know regulatory

852
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,679
structure for our licensed market um to

853
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,359
streamline efforts you know to combine

854
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,960
resources so that we could be more

855
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,798
efficient and more effective as a

856
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,200
regulatory agency in california

857
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,200
excellent thank you so much that helps

858
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,798
helps me understand

859
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,798
what what's going on

860
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,519
so it's always a dynamic

861
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:28,158
industry isn't it

862
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,120
katie question for you and that is

863
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,440
how do we elevate safety as a priority

864
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,439
as cannabis regulations evolve

865
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,880
yeah well i think one of the key here i

866
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,759
i've heard everyone say it is engaging

867
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,399
science in in the policy decision making

868
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,599
process right engaging those individuals

869
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,518
who are

870
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,558
doing the research and validating the

871
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,120
methods

872
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,960
in the regulatory process or encouraging

873
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,199
them to be engaged

874
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,798
at the national safety council we did

875
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,278
that for example when we

876
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,599
embarked on product testing regulation

877
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:08,558
research we

878
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,480
gathered a scientific advisory board of

879
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,639
you know toxicologists and

880
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,599
microbiologists and others who were

881
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,038
involved in the research because we are

882
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,798
not researchers

883
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:23,038
and although we hope to come together

884
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:26,879
and have a resource that others can look

885
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:29,278
to for best practices we know that that

886
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,399
that knowledge cannot only just come

887
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,119
from us

888
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,479
um and then look to the data you know

889
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,239
there are

890
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,640
there's lots of great research happening

891
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,319
in the field and i think that as

892
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,399
policies are developed on the state

893
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:46,639
level and on the federal level as well

894
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:49,199
we have to utilize the data that's

895
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,240
available and look at the states who

896
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,519
have

897
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,399
learned lessons and elevated safety in

898
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,759
their own regulatory situation

899
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,239
and

900
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,720
you know emulate those in others

901
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,440
i think that training is another area

902
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,360
that we need to prioritize and that's

903
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,320
worker safety training that is

904
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,519
training for individuals to recognize

905
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,839
impairment

906
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,480
and there are

907
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,879
just a lot of areas that workforce

908
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,399
training public health training is

909
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,440
needed as we regulate cannabis thank you

910
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,839
very much

911
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,759
and kay as a former regulator what are

912
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,599
some of the practices or

913
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,319
maybe even best practices that you might

914
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,798
recommend to regulators who are

915
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,599
implementing new systems or

916
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,480
or reinventing their systems

917
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,319
sure

918
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,240
um well i think we

919
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,439
raised some of them already on the panel

920
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,079
and

921
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,000
particularly the independence of the

922
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,240
laboratories not having ownership in

923
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,839
common with the people that they are

924
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,038
testing or the entities that they are

925
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,319
testing

926
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,278
um

927
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,119
engaging with the scientific community

928
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,839
and being open to the kind of dialogue

929
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:06,879
that sherman was discussing earlier and

930
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:10,000
also interacting with canro which

931
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,200
had what was starting to

932
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,760
become

933
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,878
what it is now today back in 2015 but it

934
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,720
was very much at a seed level

935
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,118
and i think these organizations as well

936
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,398
as aoac are

937
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,240
critical to

938
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:25,759
regulators such as myself who do not

939
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,239
have a scientific background to

940
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,560
understand what is being told to them

941
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,199
and to try and find a balance and create

942
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:35,279
regulations that make sense

943
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,158
prior to a centralized regulatory

944
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,919
authority by a science-based agency

945
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,159
thank you and

946
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,918
most people who know me

947
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,599
know that i am

948
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,960
not shy about saying that some

949
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,800
regulations although very well intended

950
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,440
are not necessarily always that

951
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,359
practical and founded in

952
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,398
pure empirical science

953
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,159
so

954
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,480
it sounds like we're still on the

955
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,559
pathway forward and we're using many

956
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,000
resources

957
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,400
to to get there

958
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,639
so taking that rational approach looking

959
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,119
at science and and moving forward i

960
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:14,400
think is great and as as we've all been

961
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,680
talking about it's a very dynamic system

962
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,119
um

963
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,960
so

964
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,480
i'm just kind of going to throw this out

965
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,400
to everybody we still have about another

966
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,440
20 minutes left in our session and i

967
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,358
have more

968
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,760
i have more questions to fire off at our

969
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,119
panelists but at this point do you have

970
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,520
any questions that you would like to

971
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:35,838
raise please step up to the microphone

972
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,599
now we'll really test them right

973
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,199
yeah good morning and thank you for

974
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,359
being here i

975
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,759
had a question from a laboratory's

976
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,920
perspective by the time we actually test

977
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,040
something it's too late to do anything

978
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,880
about

979
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,199
product quality

980
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,240
i'm interested in where you see

981
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,838
laboratories fitting into haptic

982
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,919
gmp gap and

983
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:02,559
any ancillary testing that

984
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:07,280
we could be providing that would

985
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:08,960
ensure product safety and compliance

986
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,200
would you like to direct that to anyone

987
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,639
in particular or just open it up to

988
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,879
anybody yeah uh

989
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:18,239
well uh specifically on uh haptic and uh

990
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,358
gmp

991
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,199
okay

992
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:25,279
would any of you folks what could

993
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,279
laboratories contribute to uh

994
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,119
well when we talk about laboratory

995
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,719
testing can i ask you to qualify that

996
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,240
for me do you mean third-party

997
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,679
independent testing to comply with

998
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,159
requirements or

999
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,960
third-party independent testing but uh

1000
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:39,199
any

1001
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,480
any uh testing that would be done as

1002
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,559
part of the haptic plan or gmp or gap

1003
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,159
plan should be done by an independent

1004
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,759
laboratory

1005
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,759
so the compliance testing is different

1006
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,440
from gmp correct

1007
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,440
okay just as long as we're all on that

1008
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,920
same page

1009
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,440
anything in addition that laboratories

1010
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,559
could do to

1011
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,838
assure that okay

1012
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:03,119
uh if i missed the last thing you just

1013
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,759
said let me know because i couldn't

1014
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,599
quite hear you but um i think so i think

1015
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,160
most states allow for

1016
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,320
the third party labs to do r d testing

1017
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,920
for the uh licensees and i think that's

1018
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,920
a big part of it in our current sort of

1019
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,039
scheme is that

1020
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,400
you know

1021
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,960
whether it's

1022
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,440
you as a laboratory educating your

1023
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,280
clients on the importance of actually

1024
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,280
testing things while they're in progress

1025
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,880
versus just only doing that required

1026
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,960
test at the end

1027
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,640
right if we think about what gmp really

1028
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,400
is and how that you know would typically

1029
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:36,559
go people would really be looking a lot

1030
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,079
more at their inputs than i think what

1031
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:39,039
typically happens in the cannabis

1032
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,039
industry

1033
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,279
again as regulators like our concern

1034
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,119
right is that final product so um you

1035
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,800
know typically and it varies from state

1036
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,320
to state where you're required to test

1037
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,119
but again our our goal is that that

1038
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,000
final product is as compliant and as

1039
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,320
safe as possible for the consumer

1040
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,679
but again if you as a manufacturer

1041
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,440
really want to understand your

1042
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:00,960
manufacturing process if you really want

1043
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,720
to ensure that by the time you reach

1044
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,320
your final product stage that you do

1045
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,239
have a quality product that you will

1046
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,880
pass your testing i don't know how you

1047
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:12,319
do that without doing some in-process

1048
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,000
testing again you might want to test

1049
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,920
your inputs that you purchase from other

1050
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
vendors you may want to test midstream

1051
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,000
in your production process exactly what

1052
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,159
is important to you is up to your

1053
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,480
business process again there was a risk

1054
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,719
analysis discussion earlier this morning

1055
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,199
like risk assessment is really important

1056
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,358
and i think um i think unfortunately a

1057
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,598
lot of cannabis industry doesn't really

1058
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,199
understand that because all they all

1059
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,800
they really know is the regs say i have

1060
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,000
to test my end product

1061
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,079
but so i think there's a lot of

1062
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
education to be done and you as a lab

1063
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,320
can help explain that to them what your

1064
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,400
testing services can can offer to them

1065
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,640
in that regard because even though you

1066
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,639
know when we look at more

1067
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,639
standard gmp and other industry that

1068
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,920
often involves in-house testing right a

1069
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,960
lot of facilities will have their own

1070
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,680
labs

1071
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,039
well for one labs are very expensive so

1072
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,719
a lot of cannabis companies currently

1073
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,239
don't have them and even if they have

1074
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:03,598
the option to if they weren't required

1075
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,679
to use a third-party lab they may not

1076
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,920
want to invest in that expense

1077
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,960
and again you guys the labs are truly

1078
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,680
the experts in the science so

1079
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,838
you know why not utilize your services

1080
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,159
and your expertise rather than trying to

1081
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,279
build that in-house so i hope that helps

1082
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,199
with some of your questions but i think

1083
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,480
there's a lot of education understanding

1084
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,159
that still needs to be done in that

1085
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,760
regard

1086
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,879
thank you and i think we have a question

1087
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,560
on here to decide hello uh thank you all

1088
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,358
for the work you do and everybody on the

1089
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,799
panel um like to just ask this question

1090
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,960
to the panel so

1091
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,800
speaking of plating based methods we

1092
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,240
recently also had a large recall in

1093
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,000
michigan

1094
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,598
what is the regulatory approach for

1095
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,679
auditing products in

1096
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,240
colorado and california to confirm

1097
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,679
refute previously recalled products with

1098
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,239
safety concerns

1099
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,239
um how do we approach this with plating

1100
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,959
methods that have such lack of

1101
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:59,759
reproducibility internally and amongst

1102
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,760
other labs as well

1103
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,920
sounds like a question for sure

1104
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,838
yes i monitor

1105
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,399
the

1106
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:12,239
recalls

1107
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,079
in the various states

1108
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:17,199
and so i've seen

1109
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,240
an increase in the frequency of

1110
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,239
recalls for

1111
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,240
cannabis products that have

1112
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,559
you know that are tested to be beyond uh

1113
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,719
the action levels for

1114
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,799
total yeast and mold

1115
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,639
for asthma jealous

1116
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,560
and there are other contaminants i focus

1117
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,078
on the microbial

1118
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:44,400
the one thing you mentioned plating

1119
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,079
systems and this is very problematic

1120
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,318
in the sense that let's just take the

1121
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,720
example of

1122
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,400
you know total yeast and mold

1123
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,318
is that

1124
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,559
first of all

1125
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,719
cannabinoid there's in the literature

1126
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,759
there's con the cannabinoids have been

1127
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:01,279
shown

1128
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,400
to have

1129
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,440
antibiotic activity so when

1130
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,920
i say that word to myself i think

1131
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:14,679
bacterial but if you also go into the

1132
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,680
literature there are certain antibiotics

1133
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,119
that

1134
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,039
besides

1135
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,400
affecting the growth of bacteria also

1136
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,719
affect the growth

1137
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,680
of total yeast and mold

1138
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:28,159
that's been shown in a paper that we

1139
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:31,440
recently published where in the plating

1140
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:34,399
system of drbc which has chloramphenicol

1141
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,240
and an additional antibiotic actually

1142
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,119
decreased

1143
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,399
the

1144
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,160
growth of aspergillus by fivefold

1145
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,760
on this plating system

1146
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,318
secondly

1147
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,480
there's endophytes you're not measuring

1148
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:51,838
all the total yeast and molds that's

1149
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,039
been shown also in the literature

1150
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,199
and

1151
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,759
that's why we are a proponent you know

1152
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,519
of qpcr testing

1153
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,599
so i'm wondering if this might be an

1154
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,000
opportunity where jenny might talk about

1155
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,920
in california anyway how do you handle

1156
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,559
when the the

1157
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,639
i'm sure this never happens anywhere but

1158
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,960
there's a discrepancy or there's a

1159
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:14,719
deficiency during an investigation or

1160
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,800
something on the coa

1161
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,318
doesn't quite line up how it would never

1162
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,400
happen in reality right so it's all

1163
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,639
hypothetical

1164
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,639
how do you handle that in california

1165
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,719
yeah yeah i don't have uh direct purview

1166
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,559
over the lab side but we did have a

1167
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:33,519
recent recall that that did

1168
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:36,799
that we did execute at dcc

1169
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:39,759
um if the if there is a deficiency in

1170
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,640
um lab results generally licensees are

1171
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,480
very helpful and move very swiftly to

1172
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,279
help us in a voluntary recall

1173
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,358
if

1174
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,200
if a coa doesn't pass they also have the

1175
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,400
option of remediation

1176
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,000
which is

1177
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,400
sending it back to a manufacturer to

1178
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,199
either repackage it or

1179
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,400
correct it for any kind of uh for any

1180
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,679
kind of deficiency that could mean again

1181
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,559
repackaging

1182
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,199
or

1183
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,078
uh drying if the lr activity was too

1184
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:11,519
high

1185
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,680
um remediating for molds or for

1186
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,358
heavy metals or or pesticides or

1187
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:16,879
something if possible generally the

1188
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,759
edibles are more

1189
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,838
difficult to remediate if it's if it's

1190
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,160
unless it's packaging

1191
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,159
and so those are kind of deficiencies on

1192
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,480
the coa testing side again the

1193
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:30,559
deficiencies that come out of a

1194
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,559
compliance inspection of a facility we

1195
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,559
work through a like you know we work

1196
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,159
closely with licensee to correct them

1197
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,000
depending on the risk

1198
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:41,838
thank you very much and i believe we

1199
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,679
have a question over here yes thank you

1200
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,279
um i have two questions

1201
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,239
the first one

1202
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,240
is

1203
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,318
what is going on with any kind of

1204
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,639
standards writing

1205
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:56,159
or application either proposed or

1206
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,759
generic i know that astm had their d37

1207
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,598
committee and was looking into i was on

1208
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,359
that committee for a while i found it

1209
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,400
very slow moving actually thorough but

1210
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:03,598
still moving but they're certainly a

1211
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,519
respected organization i don't know

1212
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,680
where they're at but it would seem to me

1213
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,440
that at least some kind of

1214
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,000
standards

1215
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,720
from which agents state agencies could

1216
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,559
or or private sector could comply uh

1217
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,358
either voluntarily or

1218
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:21,039
uh with some modifications are well

1219
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,400
needed in the industry for everything

1220
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,199
from

1221
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,559
labeling um packaging dosing what have

1222
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,078
you

1223
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,318
my second question is if you don't mind

1224
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,359
i'll take that liberty um you may not be

1225
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:33,119
the right panel for it but i imagine

1226
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:34,639
you'll have something to say anyway

1227
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,280
because most people do what in the world

1228
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,559
is going on with the fda and cbd or

1229
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,400
three and a half years since the farm

1230
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,559
bill was passed there's a tremendous

1231
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,639
remains tremendous confusion what i like

1232
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,358
to call the rubik's cube between laws

1233
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:50,318
and regulations and industry

1234
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:52,559
knowledge as a lawyer i i it's hard

1235
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:55,759
enough to advise people what to do with

1236
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,599
this industry and uh to do it safely and

1237
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,359
correctly without violating well too

1238
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,200
many laws but um uh to try to explain

1239
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:05,358
yes hemp is a legal product but no you

1240
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,719
can't sell cbd if it's an adjustable

1241
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,639
because the fda hasn't gotten around to

1242
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,799
it so with those liberties i look

1243
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,639
forward to your comments

1244
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,640
if it's okay i'll take the first the

1245
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,559
first question there

1246
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,719
with respect to standards

1247
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,279
so as we know the regulations came out

1248
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,318
before the standards came out right so

1249
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,880
standards organizations aoec ascm many

1250
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:28,719
of them have been running really fast to

1251
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,640
try to catch up to regulations and we're

1252
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,358
kind of like doing this right now

1253
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,358
and education has become a very strong

1254
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,159
part of that whole process

1255
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,559
so

1256
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:41,118
i also was very involved with ascm in

1257
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:44,559
fact i was a founding member of d37

1258
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,920
um but i'm no longer involved with astm

1259
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,159
there are only so many volunteer

1260
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,358
activities i can i can handle

1261
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:54,318
so i put my energy into aoac and it's a

1262
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,480
very robust process um as heather

1263
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,639
mentioned earlier it's not a popularity

1264
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,400
contest it's not a we need a method oh

1265
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,920
i'll write one great it's great it

1266
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,639
sounds great let's vote it in it's now a

1267
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:08,480
standard it's a very very very rigorous

1268
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:10,960
process that that it goes through

1269
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,639
so standard methods already exist we

1270
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,079
have first action

1271
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:19,118
methods for cannabinoids in

1272
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,839
plant material and bever in

1273
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,400
concentrates and oils we have methods

1274
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:27,119
for heavy metals we have methods for

1275
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,160
beverages coming out so we do have those

1276
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,440
methods many of them are from

1277
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:36,318
private organizations urofins

1278
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,679
was if you're familiar with europeans

1279
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:40,079
is

1280
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:43,199
responsible for the very first potency

1281
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,760
or cannabinoid method that's out there

1282
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,159
so they do exist they are catching up

1283
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,319
but they're put through

1284
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,559
a lot of rigor before they become

1285
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:55,599
standard test methods they have to go

1286
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,880
through a vetted expert review panel

1287
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,480
where you can't just sign up and say

1288
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,000
yeah i want to vote on a method you

1289
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,760
actually have to have

1290
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,358
qualifications to be on that committee

1291
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,359
and review it so they are catching up

1292
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,358
and our panelists here are part of that

1293
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,039
and

1294
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:12,639
you know on the on the other side of

1295
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,239
that saying oh hi

1296
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,920
you know you feel like a limp noodle

1297
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:18,000
after you've submitted a method and it's

1298
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,559
gone through that erp and medicinal

1299
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,719
genomics has gone through it um

1300
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,480
on behalf of the product testing side of

1301
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,118
it as well

1302
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,440
so a number about a year or so ago a

1303
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,920
number of uh products were

1304
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,240
put through the ringers of hell

1305
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,519
for product standardization for total

1306
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,679
yeast and mold

1307
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,759
medicinal genomics was one of them so

1308
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,879
it's not an easy process to get through

1309
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,079
but right now organizations like aoac

1310
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,079
are working very hard

1311
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,760
as the advisor for that particular

1312
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,079
program we have scientists from around

1313
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,559
the world we have working groups that

1314
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,240
number in the hundreds and on you know

1315
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,000
try managing a phone call with 100

1316
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,838
people on the line from

1317
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,559
seven or eight different countries all

1318
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:04,318
coalescing on one scientific method it's

1319
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,839
not an easy process but we're all

1320
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:10,239
working together recognizing that the

1321
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,000
regulatory landscape is ever so changing

1322
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,279
and trying to keep up with that and also

1323
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,920
trying to

1324
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,480
educate regulators on the empirical

1325
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,400
science side of that so all of that is

1326
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,199
moving forward now

1327
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,480
as for the other question

1328
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,759
i'm not on that panel i don't have to

1329
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,719
answer that question i'm going to leave

1330
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,359
that to our friends here

1331
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:34,159
have at it well i don't know as as none

1332
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:35,920
of us are actually working at the fda we

1333
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:38,399
obviously can't answer that question

1334
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,440
with any degree of confidence or

1335
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,240
knowledge

1336
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,200
but

1337
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:45,199
we do know that the fda is

1338
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,279
taking some enforcement action in fact

1339
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,598
did so just this week regarding uh

1340
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,079
companies not only that are selling cbd

1341
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,359
but also uh for the first time delta

1342
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,440
eight uh and making claims that the fda

1343
00:48:55,358 --> 00:49:00,078
deemed appropriate so

1344
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,159
they are taking some action uh but i

1345
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,400
think as everyone in this room is aware

1346
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:07,679
have not yet issued any sort of

1347
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:10,720
nationwide regulations we certainly

1348
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,078
think look forward to the day that that

1349
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,959
does occur

1350
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,119
but unfortunately it has not yet i think

1351
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,920
the fda is in the best position to do

1352
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,079
that

1353
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,358
in a way that it puts public health and

1354
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,000
public safety at the forefront

1355
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:28,719
thank you very much thank you thank you

1356
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,719
next question

1357
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,079
thank you guys a great panel wow that's

1358
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,318
mike's

1359
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,200
um i had a couple questions

1360
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:40,480
i think i'll drop this one first one

1361
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,879
do you guys on the panel see

1362
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,880
any possible

1363
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,440
way to regulate the enormous amount of

1364
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,880
waste that's being produced for instance

1365
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,720
in california

1366
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,640
it has to be packaged products huge

1367
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,159
amounts of waste the lab produces when

1368
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,879
they have to you know open up all these

1369
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,879
products not just paper or cardboard but

1370
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,640
the batteries themselves we have to find

1371
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,039
you know ways to recycle that is there

1372
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:03,838
any thought on ever kind of regulating

1373
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:06,000
that

1374
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:07,119
or finding a way around it environmental

1375
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,119
concerns you know yesterday we had a

1376
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:13,838
panel around it and um it's of concern

1377
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,838
that's my first question

1378
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,880
that is something that has been uh that

1379
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,599
has been discussed including you know

1380
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,079
the tags that are used um for track and

1381
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,760
trace you know that they're but i i've

1382
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,119
heard that there are companies now that

1383
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,640
are looking to recycle them once the

1384
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,200
rfid or chip

1385
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:34,639
rfid chip is removed from the tags

1386
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:36,318
um it is a concern um i think i would

1387
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:38,239
have to check in with cal recycle to

1388
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:39,920
better answer your question so if we can

1389
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,399
connect um off

1390
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,240
after the panel i can i can try to find

1391
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,639
out the answer for you

1392
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:48,000
fantastic thank you so much um i'm

1393
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:49,679
really hoping you know it's great to see

1394
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,599
you all together that there'll be some

1395
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,519
kind of uh future collaboration among

1396
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,760
the states to sort of

1397
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,358
simplify and standardize and i think

1398
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,720
susan answered my other question which

1399
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,078
was really around

1400
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:05,118
uh do you foresee adopting you know cass

1401
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,960
or some other compendium method and

1402
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,000
giving the industry especially

1403
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,318
laboratories opportunity to either adopt

1404
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,199
that or at least be prepared and i asked

1405
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,639
this in light of you know january 1st

1406
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,480
right um

1407
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,159
there's about what seven months left

1408
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,280
will there be opportunity for that or

1409
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:23,838
will it be

1410
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,480
you know okay now adopt this in the next

1411
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:26,480
30 days

1412
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:34,400
it's not uncommon for other industries

1413
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,640
to defer to an aoac or usp method

1414
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,039
in fact you can go to the fda website

1415
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:41,440
for some testing where the fda will

1416
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:44,719
defer to an aoec method for example or

1417
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,358
an astm method for example so

1418
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:49,439
i personally foresee that happening in

1419
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,920
the future if there comes a time when

1420
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,519
the fda or other federal regulatory body

1421
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,159
steps in

1422
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,480
that they may very likely defer

1423
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,318
laboratories to a specific

1424
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,240
compendium method

1425
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,719
but who's you know no mind readers here

1426
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:06,879
i don't have a crystal ball but judging

1427
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:09,919
from other industries i wouldn't be

1428
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,318
surprised if that were the case

1429
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,318
thank you

1430
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,240
hello again

1431
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,519
current california law allows for an rpd

1432
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:21,759
of 30

1433
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:26,159
in potency analysis

1434
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,640
uh plus or minus i'm curious if uh with

1435
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:32,078
the adoption of

1436
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:34,159
standardized methods if that would be

1437
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,720
tightened

1438
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:40,078
a laboratory can

1439
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:42,239
be off by 30 percent and their

1440
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,400
analysis still be valid

1441
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,399
if that's still the case with a

1442
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,720
standardized method nothing's going to

1443
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,720
change

1444
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,679
can so i'm sorry it's just a little the

1445
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,000
monitors are weird to hear but you said

1446
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,000
california labs are allowed to be off of

1447
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,119
their california regulations have been

1448
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,280
rdp of thirty percent plus or minus

1449
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,640
thirty three percent so again is that

1450
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,119
there's two there's a difference there

1451
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,039
though and again um is the laboratory

1452
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,000
allowed to be off by thirty percent or

1453
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,639
is the

1454
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,800
label uh number allowed to be within

1455
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,118
thirty percent of the laboratory's uh

1456
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,359
test result the the results of the

1457
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,079
laboratory can vary

1458
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:23,519
plus or minus 30 percent well be within

1459
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,000
regulation

1460
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:29,039
so the question is is there going to be

1461
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,239
a tightening of that criteria

1462
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,960
in

1463
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,358
with the adoption of standardized

1464
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,358
methods

1465
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:43,119
i would hope so

1466
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:45,599
yeah go ahead susan so the aoac is is

1467
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,440
non-partisan it's non-governmental right

1468
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,920
it's it's for the public

1469
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,559
it's not for anything private

1470
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,838
um so when the method performance

1471
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,079
requirements are published and and

1472
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:00,880
there's a solicitation for methods we

1473
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,160
make every effort to keep it as broad as

1474
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,640
possible

1475
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:07,679
as long as it's scientifically sound

1476
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:10,480
um up to this point casp has been

1477
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,919
focusing on meeting regulatory

1478
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,679
requirements

1479
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,519
because the industry is desperate for

1480
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,159
those test methods to meet regulatory

1481
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:20,400
requirements but we all recognize that a

1482
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,318
lot of those requirements

1483
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,358
are not necessarily

1484
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:27,519
founded empirically um so it's a very

1485
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:30,480
difficult balance in developing those

1486
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:32,639
standard methods now if we're not

1487
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,199
chasing a regulation and we establish

1488
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,358
the performance requirements of a method

1489
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:39,519
then life is good right now it's up to

1490
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,279
the state to either require

1491
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:44,639
a lab to meet our requirements the

1492
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:47,519
standard requirements or not but we aoac

1493
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:50,078
methods do not dictate to the state

1494
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:51,119
but the state does have the ability to

1495
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,280
dictate

1496
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,079
back down to the standard method

1497
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,839
um so that that process

1498
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,240
questions the question really pertains

1499
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,558
to the development of standard methods

1500
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:05,759
and whether or not that would be a

1501
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,440
consideration i hope so but you know

1502
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,839
there are so many things that i wish for

1503
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,679
in this industry in the testing industry

1504
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:16,558
um and my hope is that the regulatory

1505
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:18,399
bodies that kay and others have so

1506
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,319
profoundly mentioned today have not

1507
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,599
necessarily based on the scientific

1508
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:23,920
foundation

1509
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,280
but now we have an institution like casp

1510
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,200
that's available in providing that

1511
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,920
education so my hope is that in time

1512
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:33,679
those regulations will become more in

1513
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,400
line with

1514
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:36,318
better

1515
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,318
or more sound science and i know i'm not

1516
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:40,400
answering your question very directly

1517
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,239
i'm trying to be

1518
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,079
i have my own opinion

1519
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,639
but i'm trying to be

1520
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,318
cognizant and respective of all the

1521
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,318
regulatory environment thank you

1522
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,880
my turn

1523
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,039
that's not too loud

1524
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,039
so

1525
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,280
going back to uh

1526
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:05,679
the cannabis controls are the regulatory

1527
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,400
limits for some of the category one uh

1528
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:10,399
pesticides and the uh

1529
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,920
from the cannabis control group for here

1530
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,119
in california

1531
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,039
um has there been discussion about

1532
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,519
perhaps making those more scientifically

1533
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,798
valid because to say

1534
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:23,599
not detected is your lower limit is

1535
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:24,400
i

1536
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,960
don't know

1537
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,559
the statistics aren't there so

1538
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,838
i don't know if there's any movement on

1539
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,839
trying to make that more

1540
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:37,199
more of a normal

1541
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:39,199
value i'm not saying that right but

1542
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,039
the way it is now to say that if you

1543
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:43,118
detect anything at all even though it's

1544
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:46,000
below your limit of detection you have

1545
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:50,240
to call that bad

1546
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,239
it violates science so what do you think

1547
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,440
i'll look at me so i'll try to i can try

1548
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:57,598
to i'm not i'm not from california so i

1549
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,760
can't really say um what the regulators

1550
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,240
are possibly going to do in terms of

1551
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,640
defining that but i i think your

1552
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:07,358
concern is very valid um

1553
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:09,440
for one lab shouldn't be reporting a

1554
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:11,358
detection below their limit of detection

1555
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,960
as a result because again it's below the

1556
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:14,239
limit of detection and theory you can't

1557
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,519
see it

1558
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,199
and you certainly can't see it with any

1559
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,920
accuracy

1560
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:22,078
but two

1561
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,680
a

1562
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,280
saying that the limit of detection is

1563
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,358
the action limit

1564
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,720
it also i think is problematic because

1565
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:30,318
different laboratories are going to have

1566
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:33,118
different detection limits based upon

1567
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,000
their individual methodology so

1568
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,440
you may

1569
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,039
take the same sample to two different

1570
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,400
labs and pass that one and fill it the

1571
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:39,599
other when it's based upon the limit of

1572
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,519
detection and it doesn't actually mean

1573
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,838
either lab is wrong so i think that's

1574
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,280
also very you know challenging then to

1575
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,119
um

1576
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,280
to understand as a

1577
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,160
the customer submitting the result or

1578
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,599
the sample for results but also it will

1579
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,318
further drive our problems with lab

1580
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,440
shopping where again labs may be tempted

1581
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:59,440
to

1582
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,599
make an artificially high limit of

1583
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,039
detection so that they can pass more

1584
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,000
samples that shouldn't actually be

1585
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:04,960
passing

1586
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,960
but

1587
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,720
we could probably spend another hour or

1588
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,559
two talking about the challenges with

1589
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:12,719
pesticides and trying to come up with

1590
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,760
action levels for cannabis given that

1591
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:15,519
the

1592
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,839
you know the epa has not established

1593
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:19,440
tolerance limits for pesticides on on

1594
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:21,279
cannabis and so

1595
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,400
i completely understand why california

1596
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,240
has defined

1597
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,519
those category one pesticides as a not

1598
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:27,039
detect

1599
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:28,798
but again as we just talked about

1600
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:30,400
there's a lot of challenges with that so

1601
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,960
i think i think regulators across the

1602
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,039
country are grappling with how to

1603
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,519
require testing and establish action

1604
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:39,279
limits for pesticides in in cannabis

1605
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:40,798
we're having an ongoing working group in

1606
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,720
colorado and frankly we've been talking

1607
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,358
about pesticides for years we're looking

1608
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:47,118
at it right now again and it's just a

1609
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:48,558
it's a really complicated debate to try

1610
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,079
to figure out how to do this when we

1611
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,359
don't have the data that we would

1612
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,798
normally have

1613
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,440
for something that you know would

1614
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:57,039
normally be a federally defined

1615
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:02,240
number so

1616
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:02,239
we are i am so sorry to say out of time

1617
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,880
and i can

1618
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,798
we are one minute over but if you are a

1619
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,119
game maybe we can field one more

1620
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:11,119
question

1621
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:17,279
or we can

1622
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:19,119
say thank you very much to our panelists

1623
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,359
and i thank you

1624
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,880
on behalf of all of us here up on the

1625
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,078
stage for your participation and

1626
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,079
engagement

1627
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:29,200
if you have any questions catch us when

1628
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:32,000
we step down or when they step down and

1629
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:35,000
enjoy the rest of the of the day take

1630
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
care
