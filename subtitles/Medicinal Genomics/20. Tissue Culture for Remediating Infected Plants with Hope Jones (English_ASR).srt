missions in our conversation

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
we talked a lot about tissue culture as

61
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,759
hope will be leading a panel

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,840
on the topic at canmed 2021 we covered

63
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,840
how cultivators use tissue culture to

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
remediate plants that are infected with

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
pathogens such as powdery mildew and

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,639
hoplate and viroid

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,159
how the covid19 pandemic has actually

68
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,318
made hope's conversations with

69
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,519
cultivators about plant viruses

70
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,560
and pathogens much easier how tissue

71
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,920
culture can produce

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,239
changes to the plant's dna why alcohol

73
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,518
is not an effective antiviral solution

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
for plants

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,879
how cryogenic storage of tissue cultured

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,199
mother plants

77
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,878
can be used as an insurance policy

78
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,119
against pathogen infection

79
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,120
or other disasters and much more

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,560
before we get to that conversation i

81
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,680

122
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,560
good afternoon hope thank you so much

123
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,239
for joining us

124
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,639
hi ben all right so

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
tissue culture very excited to talk with

126
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,800
you about this

127
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,159
and um our audience may already be

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
familiar with tissue culture because i

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,000
did speak with

130
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,079
mark jordan in a previous episode and we

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,879
discussed tissue culture and mostly

132
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,719
around

133
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,478
sort of how it's performed and the

134
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
different stages of tissue culture and

135
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,079
how the whole

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,680
process works but for this conversation

137
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,000
i'd really like to talk with you about

138
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,879
how

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,600
tissue culture can actually be applied

140
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,519
um in cannabis and hemp cultivation so

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,360
maybe a good place to start is can you

142
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,439
tell me how widely used

143
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:27,520
is tissue culture in cannabis and hemp

144
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:30,079
so tissue culture is widely used in

145
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,038
in practice when it comes to regular i

146
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,959
say regular

147
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,560
quotes um regular agriculture

148
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,879
horticulture

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,079
when i started doing cannabis tissue

150
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,360
culture i

151
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,120
i realized nobody's doing this and if

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,479
we're doing a lot of cloning it makes

153
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,800
sense and then i

154
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,680
will i'm sure get into all the other

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,720
advantages

156
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,639
um to tissue culture but it it was

157
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,880
actually pretty shocking um

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,079
but then not surprising once i thought

159
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,719
about it that nobody

160
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,359
in the cannabis or hemp industry had had

161
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,479
had been

162
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,080
um approaching that at least not at any

163
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,758
kind of real

164
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:10,719
commercial scale that i had seen and so

165
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,520
it makes sense uh given the nature of

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,479
the cannabis

167
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,839
industry having to be underground for so

168
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,918
long how how are you

169
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,679
to actually even think about doing

170
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,758
something along those lines so

171
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
it made sense to me when i thought about

172
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,038
it of course and i thought well

173
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
i have an opportunity to contribute uh

174
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,000
to this industry

175
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,639
um so i just oh i park myself i feel at

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,519
home and

177
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,038
and i'm happy to to help the industry

178
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,038
understand

179
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,240
what it can do what its potential

180
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,519
benefits are

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,800
and you know really there are cons that

182
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,240
come along with it as well

183
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,439
so i'm sure we'll get to all that

184
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,439
excellent all right well let's start

185
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,399
with the pros what are some reasons that

186
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,439
cultivators

187
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:59,038
should be using tissue culture

188
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,038
so i think probably the most common

189
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,318
commonly understood would be the idea

190
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,680
that you can

191
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,720
produce a lot of clones in a very small

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,038
amount of space and that is true

193
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,160
um and and that's exciting so the fact

194
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,279
that you can

195
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,919
take one cut um the hat

196
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,598
that in that cut should have a node

197
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,439
obviously and we can

198
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,360
either culture that node or we can

199
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,478
culture the very tip

200
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,120
of that node we call the meristematic um

201
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,959
cells up there um but either way you can

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,240
just take a part of a plant and you can

203
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,198
plate it

204
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,000
onto tissue cultured tissue culture

205
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,598
media

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,519
and the media has everything a

207
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,719
growing plant needs for growth

208
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,359
development

209
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,879
vitamins the obvious elements and and

210
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,000
hormones

211
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,120
and we can do that in a small think of a

212
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,478
baby food jar

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,319
or deli cups um about that size

214
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,279
you can have multiple plants in each one

215
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,360
of those vessels are each one of

216
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,559
our cuttings in in in one of those

217
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,400
vessels

218
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,000
and if you have good healthy stock in

219
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,560
those vessels then you're off to the

220
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,240
races

221
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,560
and so it really comes down to the um

222
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,598
the ip of the nutrient that's within

223
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,680
that media on

224
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,519
what your actual multiplication rate can

225
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,879
be but on average let's just

226
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,079
let's say at least two to four x so one

227
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,280
cut gives you

228
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,800
two or four additional plants um after

229
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,399
about four weeks is the way we think

230
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,839
about it so i think that's probably

231
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,199
the the most um popularized

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,680
understanding of

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,158
of of tissue culture for any plant um

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,519
in cannabis in particular to me the

235
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,600
reason why i do it

236
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,799
is because we are dealing with a plant

237
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,000
that was grown

238
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:53,519
underground first for obviously

239
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,720
decades and decades and decades um

240
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,959
and bred for one thing only

241
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
and that was not disease resistance it

242
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,039
was bred for

243
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,439
obviously cannabinoid um production and

244
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,399
and

245
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,160
and high thc in particular so we have

246
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,958
plants that are

247
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,360
pretty weak to environmental stresses

248
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,278
and

249
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,200
and diseases that come along with it and

250
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,838
so tissue culture

251
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,959
allows us to try to eradicate those

252
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,560
diseases

253
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:25,759
and generate stock and a lot of it as

254
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:29,679
i was explaining and and when done right

255
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,679
and um using testing to to verify

256
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,879
we we should be able to produce a lot of

257
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,000
clones that

258
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,080
don't have known diseases and

259
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
that's really why why i do it because

260
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,000
we're dealing with

261
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,759
i think an epidemic when it comes to

262
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,759
diseases because we do have some

263
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:52,159
you know a very a focused

264
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,000
um breeding for so long that it's gonna

265
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,600
take a while for these breeders

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,278
um and there's a lot of great ones out

267
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,320
there uh busy working

268
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,679
and and and doing this to generate more

269
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,480
strains that are that are

270
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:07,599
um resistant to various environmental

271
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,600
stresses and diseases

272
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,838
so that's really interesting that you

273
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,519
mention

274
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,760
pathogens and diseases that are

275
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,679
affecting the plant

276
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,039
coincidentally here in medicinal

277
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,958
genomics

278
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,639
we're developing an assay actually we

279
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,838
just released an assay

280
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,838
um to test for viruses within the plant

281
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,279
mostly poplatine thyroid lettuce

282
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,880
chlorosis virus and

283
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,320
cannabis cryptic virus and i'll i'll say

284
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,559
the response that we've gotten

285
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
from the cultivator community around

286
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,719
those

287
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,879
assays has been very strong

288
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,920
which seems to jive with what you were

289
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,919
just saying that

290
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,360
there seems to be a bit of an epidemic

291
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,599
when it comes to

292
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,680
um diseases among the cannabis plants so

293
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,240
it's very interesting that you say

294
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,439
uh that you say that just because um

295
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,720
we've been experiencing

296
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,360
that ourselves too so so maybe that's a

297
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,240
good

298
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,800
place good um topic to get into as far

299
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,959
as how can tissue culture be used to

300
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,278
remediate plants that maybe are showing

301
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,879
some signs of infection

302
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,000
so um yeah i love your guys's company i

303
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,519
love companies like

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
yours because um we need the ability to

305
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,078
be able to test and there's not enough

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,159
companies out there doing it and so the

307
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,519
cost of it is still really high

308
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,759
because of that and many people are

309
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,919
still becoming educated about the

310
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,679
process of testing and how frequently to

311
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,039
do it so i think uh the more that

312
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,319
companies like yourself

313
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,919
others um consultants and nurseries like

314
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,040
myself who are um

315
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:46,159
out there you know helping these

316
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,879
uh cultivators be able to produce

317
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,639
um and and and produce on margins that

318
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,720
are getting smaller and smaller

319
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,799
we must have the ability to be able to

320
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,079
test and then we must be able to do

321
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,519
something about it once we

322
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:01,199
find out let's just get to one of the

323
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,278
big ones the hot blatant viroid for

324
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,079
example right um so once you get that

325
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,720
sucker

326
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,359
what the hell are we going to do and so

327
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,839
um

328
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,759
with plant tissue cultures so so the

329
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,279
strawberry industry is a really good

330
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,000
example strawberries are very

331
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,480
susceptible to various um

332
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,919
pathogens and and viruses and viroids

333
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,959
and i'm just going to use disease

334
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,439
as a generic term that is every kind of

335
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,119
a fungal bacterial virus viroid as a

336
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,639
generic and then

337
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,078
probably just use hot plate and viroid

338
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,560
for the sake of our conversation for

339
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,399
something

340
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,399
as a specific example when it comes to

341
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,639
one of those um

342
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
but strawberry is really susceptible to

343
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,480
disease and so what they

344
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
have done is they have generated clean

345
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
stock

346
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,760
and this is because uh using uh plant

347
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,200
tissue culture

348
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,759
and since um uh mark had previously

349
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
discussed

350
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,039
how you know the various stages to go

351
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,560
through that well once you go through

352
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,838
those stages so i'm not going to

353
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,000
go back over it but once you go through

354
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,079
those various stages well we can keep

355
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,919
testing and it doesn't take a big

356
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,519
sample size to do that we don't need to

357
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,879
flower the plant out we don't even need

358
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,000
to take it out of its vessel we can

359
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,600
continue to test

360
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,320
throughout the process so um

361
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
the the the what do we do once we know

362
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
that we have it so i

363
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,679
here's here's a common uh day in the

364
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,399
life of hope jones

365
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,239
um i get a call from a particular

366
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,759
company who's really struggling with

367
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,919
yields

368
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,759
and let's let's just say they used to

369
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,240
have their favorite

370
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,039
strain um and it used to produce yields

371
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,839
and uh

372
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,319
that and and percentages and and now

373
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,440
this strain is no longer doing that

374
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,440
well because just like with covid

375
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
out for us and our pandemic well plants

376
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,360
also get um

377
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,399
viruses and viroids and so with like the

378
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,839
hoplite and viroid

379
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,639
you have to know what the symptoms are

380
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,639
to be able to identify it

381
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,720
well we have a problem because obviously

382
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,720
there's not enough understanding out

383
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,440
there within these companies to

384
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,759
to a know what the symptoms necessarily

385
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,240
are

386
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,198
until um oftentimes it's too late and so

387
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,120
when i show up at somebody's facility

388
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,319
i've seen these symptoms now for so long

389
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,000
that i'm just

390
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,680
ah you know i put my hands in my pockets

391
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
i'm not touching anything i don't want

392
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,879
to tour anymore i know exactly what i'm

393
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
dealing with and the reason why i do

394
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,120
that is because

395
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,278
these diseases almost every single time

396
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,759
are very easily transmitted by us right

397
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,159
so

398
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,759
uh we call that um you know mechanical

399
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,799
or

400
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,919
yeah mechanical transmission and so i

401
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,359
can take

402
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:38,639
a plant from their facility and um

403
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,639
my r d lab in arizona is is hemp and so

404
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,480
i'm taking a plant from somebody's

405
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,560
facility back to my lab

406
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,079
and i'm working with taking cuts from

407
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,159
this plant i'm sending it to a third

408
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,599
party lab for testing and identification

409
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,919
of these diseases so i always know what

410
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,079
i'm

411
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,078
looking at but now i'm going to start

412
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,198
the process of trying to dissect the

413
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:56,879
smallest parts

414
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,759
of that plant that i can that will

415
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,720
survive in tissue culture and oftentimes

416
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,399
that's that's that meristematic cells

417
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
well why do i why do we do that well we

418
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,159
know from

419
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,799
decades and decades of research and

420
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,559
other plants that have

421
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,399
these various diseases and the reason

422
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,919
why this is this particular disease is

423
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,440
hoplite and thyroid is it was originally

424
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,000
identified in hops

425
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,079
closely related um plant to us makes a

426
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,120
lot of secondary metabolites just like

427
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,879
our plants do

428
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,799
has resin glands just like ours so

429
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,078
that's a pretty good place to

430
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,838
to study and so just like we see

431
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,000
reduction in yields will so

432
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,279
do the hop growers they were seeing you

433
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,919
know um

434
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,559
in papers back into the early 80s when

435
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,078
it was

436
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,638
really identified and characterized you

437
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:45,519
know reductions in and

438
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
oil production by up to 40 percent uh

439
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,879
fewer

440
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,720
lateral branching and which you know

441
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,958
that's going to give you less biomass

442
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,079
all of these problems right and so very

443
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,479
similar to what we're seeing

444
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,278
plus we've had companies out there

445
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,440
identify

446
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,000
um and characterize the hoplaton viroids

447
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,759
so if i can take the smallest piece

448
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,879
possible and if i can learn from these

449
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,159
other plants um species where the

450
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,480
highest density of

451
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,278
of these particular particles are in the

452
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,879
plant

453
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,799
i'm going to try to avoid taking

454
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,399
cuttings from that part of the plants

455
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,799
and i'm going to try to go

456
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,919
and and and you know it's theorized

457
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,639
anyway that

458
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,360
hot blatant virus seems to really

459
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,680
populate

460
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,199
in the roots in the base of the plants

461
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,198
and so

462
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,719
is that true in cannabis it's it's yet

463
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,559
to be wholly characterized and

464
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,560
determined so but i'm gonna

465
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,919
actually say i'm gonna go for the tips

466
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,399
anyway

467
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,838
and i'm going to take as the healthiest

468
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,839
tips that i can

469
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,839
and i'm going to take those meristematic

470
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
cells and why the meristem instead of

471
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,600
the node

472
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,519
i'm going to do that is because a lot of

473
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
these diseases have a tendency to

474
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,600
localize and travel through the plant in

475
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,440
the vascular system

476
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,079
conveniently the meristematic cells are

477
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,560
not connected to the vascular system so

478
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,000
if we carefully excise that those

479
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,438
meristematic cells from

480
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,318
the rest of the plant we may be able to

481
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,038
um rescue tissue that does not harbor

482
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,480
any of that

483
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,318
disease or those viroid particles

484
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,160
so that's the idea and that's how it's

485
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,359
been done and and so many other plant

486
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,558
species

487
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,038
strawberries turn this into a very um

488
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:23,038
feasible

489
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,918
process and it's still commercially

490
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,000
viable right and so

491
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,960
i'm going to use a model out there that

492
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,960
and approach that

493
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,480
with cannabis in the same way because

494
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,720
that's a

495
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,960
industry that's focused on um providing

496
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,720
in their industries in any industry but

497
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,759
cannabis certified stock

498
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,519
that is disease free or at least free

499
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,359
of the disease that they're um

500
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,599
specifically testing for

501
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,798
so we can't do that and and we don't we

502
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,359
should be able to do that but there's

503
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,519
just not a system set up to do that but

504
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,879
if you are working with plant tissue

505
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,400
culture companies

506
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,080
um those would be the things that i

507
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,080
would ask what are you testing for

508
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,678
how are you going about that process how

509
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,399
can you be sure

510
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,720
um that when i get it that it doesn't

511
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,480
have that particular virus or viroid or

512
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,480
whatever your problem is but

513
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,839
that's our approach that's why we do it

514
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,679
and

515
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,839
financially if we get to a point where

516
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,759
we're constantly dealing with this like

517
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,159
they have with a hot blatant viroid and

518
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,798
and other viruses in the hop industry

519
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,880
just to

520
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,558
you know continue with that example

521
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
they've been dealing with this for 30

522
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,240
years of research

523
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,839
and they've yet to eradicate it and

524
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
they're seeing they and the reason why

525
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,558
they spent

526
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,160
all of that time and put in you know

527
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,879
decades and decades of research

528
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,080
is because it affects the bottom line

529
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,200
yes it affects the

530
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,439
taste and the bitterness and all of that

531
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,120
that comes about those secondary

532
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,480
metabolites that are produced like those

533
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,719
alpha acids that

534
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,839
that's being used but we're seeing those

535
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,400
reductions too

536
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,038
right and so that hurts and we cannot

537
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,200
continue

538
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,160
down that road so we've got to try to

539
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,840
attack um

540
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,440
this problem from multiple approaches

541
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,439
and tissue cultures but one

542
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,280
now it sounds like tissue culture is

543
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,038
really used when

544
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,960
you know a problem has been identified

545
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,798
and you're trying to kind of salvage the

546
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,519
plant but can it be used sort of

547
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,359
proactively as your propagation

548
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,558
technique and will that always produce

549
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,918
something that's

550
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,319
that's clean it should if it's done

551
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,600
right

552
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:29,839
if if the individuals that are doing the

553
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,798
the plant tissue culture are are

554
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,918
tracking their

555
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:37,119
their rounds of multiplication if

556
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,360
there's more um you know

557
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,879
if the ability to use molecular markers

558
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,719
allows us to make sure we're not getting

559
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,039
dna variants which can happen

560
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,880
um that would be wonderful but at least

561
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,960
we know the chemical profiles and if the

562
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,799
plants that are being produced are

563
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,400
still producing the expected chemical

564
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,359
profiles because

565
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,200
again the goal is to produce a clone not

566
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,719
to produce a variant

567
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,558
and so yeah we should be able to produce

568
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,038
that's why that you see more nurseries

569
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,720
tissue culture nurseries coming about

570
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,240
because there's no reason in the world

571
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
why we should not be able to produce

572
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,079
clones

573
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,678
at a commercial scale there's a cost

574
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,359
that comes with it but anything in our

575
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,200
industry comes with certain costs and

576
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,798
it's not for everybody but

577
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,480
you don't necessarily have to be good at

578
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,359
everything if there's nurseries and

579
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,798
there's options for um you know being

580
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,959
able to purchase that from

581
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:31,119
from neighboring companies absolutely

582
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,400
so you mentioned dna variants which

583
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,439
stuck out to me because

584
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,038
again here at medicinal genomics we do

585
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,720
we do a little sequencing work on

586
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,798
cannabis as well so

587
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,319
i'm curious um so what sort of

588
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,440
variations can you see

589
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,599
as a result from tissue culture so

590
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,120
you know what we can see in in cannabis

591
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,798
we're going to have to just compare to

592
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,359
other plant species that that's been

593
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,079
very well

594
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,959
characterized in the literature um even

595
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,720
those companies

596
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
you know like myself and other good

597
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,960
companies around the country

598
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,000
and canada other places in the world are

599
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,240
doing amazing research

600
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,038
but they don't always publish that and

601
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,480
so

602
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,558
it's going to be a long time before we

603
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,200
know all the types of dna variants

604
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,279
but in in many other plant species it's

605
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,000
known that you can get

606
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,639
um if it's not if you're if you're not

607
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
approaching

608
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,440
your tissue culture correctly if if you

609
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,200
want to maintain clones but you're

610
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,960
you're doing something and your media is

611
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,720
not right or you end up getting what's

612
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
called a lot of callous cells

613
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,319
those are undifferentiated cells that

614
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,400
develop what happens when a plant

615
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,759
forms a bunch of undifferentiated cells

616
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,519
is that

617
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,440
well they're not actually

618
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,879
signaled to do anything yet so they

619
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,798
they're not signaled to be a stem

620
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,640
they're not necessarily signaled to be

621
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,480
a root they're not necessarily signaled

622
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,280
to be uh

623
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,000
you know uh a leaf or another node

624
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,720
they're just

625
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,119
there which means if any kind of signal

626
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,240
or

627
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,839
or or change happens well it's going to

628
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,159
go with it and so i'm being

629
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,319
over simple kind of oversimplifying the

630
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,400
idea but

631
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,558
you can get a lot of what's called dna

632
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,240
off types or dna variants that happen

633
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,879
from that where each cell

634
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,679
out of that puddle or a pile of callous

635
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,400
cells can

636
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,600
can have a different expression is it

637
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
because of an actual

638
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,639
genetic change something that happened

639
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,519
to the chromosome

640
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,360
well it depends on what the stressor was

641
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,240
if there was something to cause dna

642
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,798
damage

643
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,319
that can absolutely happen just during

644
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,558
normal rounds of replica

645
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,839
dna replication as the cell divides you

646
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,399
can get

647
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,000
dna replication errors so that

648
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,038
definitely happens and if you

649
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,159
then propagate those cells up

650
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,879
into new um shoot material and then

651
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,400
you're

652
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,240
putting it on a different media to get

653
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,440
roots well then now you're going to see

654
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,919
different expressions

655
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,759
potentially depending on what those

656
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,240
genetic changes were

657
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,599
not everything's always um visual but

658
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,079
often times they can be

659
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,158
and so that's just one example and when

660
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,798
you have a pile of cells and cow cells

661
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,200
that are all

662
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,720
undifferentiated you can have millions

663
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,679
of cells depending on

664
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,038
on how many cells are there right so

665
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,240
they're very small and so you can

666
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,000
imagine that you

667
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,679
now have just in the size of like a dime

668
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,519
potentially cells that could have a

669
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,440
bunch of different genotypes and

670
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,038
it's not dna actual something that's

671
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,798
modifying the dna you might see

672
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,679
epigenetic changes

673
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,639
so epigenetic changes can are things

674
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,919
that

675
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,520
happen over time due to some sort of

676
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,880
environmental cue

677
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,798
that causes the cell that

678
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,720
it might have a localized response or it

679
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:43,440
might have a systemic response right and

680
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,038
if if a plant is constantly getting

681
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,038
some sort of um

682
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,400
signal because they can't move right so

683
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,400
they have to adapt to their environment

684
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,320
and so they're going to these these

685
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,360
signals can then all of a sudden

686
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:01,359
induce a regulatory pathway

687
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,439
up regulation down regulation what have

688
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,240
you and and those when

689
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,038
can can also happen in a bunch of

690
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,278
callous cells

691
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,720
and so you're going to see different

692
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,079
epigenetic effects

693
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,600
and i think one way i like to think

694
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,158
about it um

695
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,359
where i where my labs at i don't know

696
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,559
what the hell but

697
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,359
this parking lot every that there's one

698
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,440
way to

699
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,678
you know drive down and park your car

700
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,400
but for some reason people like to drive

701
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,200
the other way right and so that now

702
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,880
causes me

703
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
every single time i'm leaving my you

704
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,200
know getting in my truck to

705
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,720
you know not you you don't assume

706
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,480
anymore and you're constantly

707
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,159
looking on both directions and going

708
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,519
slow because it's a busy parking lot

709
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,120
whereas if you were in a different

710
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,240
environment you would have never had

711
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,399
that

712
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,558
signal so you would never be really

713
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,559
hyper sensitive to having to do that

714
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:56,639
you know i i think um you can imagine

715
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,278
how if you had a bunch of cells that

716
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,200
all of a sudden had some sort of signal

717
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,079
changes in chromosome structure

718
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,640
different dna or rna methylation

719
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,399
patterns are happening and now you can

720
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,240
check out a library book that you never

721
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,759
had access to and now you're getting a

722
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,079
different expression so

723
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,359
it can also be used for good it doesn't

724
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,038
it just means

725
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,639
why are we doing it how are we

726
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,240
approaching it do we want clonal

727
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,960
production or actually do we want to

728
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,440
kind of

729
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,600
get into that r d side of stuff it

730
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,278
depends

731
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,519
yeah that's really interesting i mean i

732
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,640
understand the epigenetic

733
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,200
part of it and i know that that can even

734
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,360
happen

735
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,720
um with clones like in traditional

736
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,519
cloning but um

737
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,880
are you saying though that with tissue

738
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,759
culture there can actually be

739
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,600
actual changes to the dna sequence or is

740
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,960
it more of an epigenetic sort of

741
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:51,278
response both both

742
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,558
wow that's interesting you know again

743
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,839
are there papers out there

744
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,519
and cannabis um that have done canvas

745
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,199
tissue culture that have looked at

746
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,639
molecular markers actually thankfully

747
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
there are a few papers out there and

748
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,759
there's

749
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,639
um only going to be more and more coming

750
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,558
so we do

751
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,400
have molecular markers like like like

752
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,240
your company is actually a great

753
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,159
resource to be able to

754
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,079
to to start um utilizing

755
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,080
the power of what a molecular marker can

756
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,720
do for us right so we can not only

757
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,720
um the ability to sequence something so

758
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,960
we can see if there's been major

759
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
genetic changes we can also look at

760
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,079
molecular markers to see

761
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,519
if we're having amplification of

762
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,399
something or if it's completely

763
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,798
disappeared

764
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,600
and it is known in other plant species

765
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:35,918
yes both

766
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,000
actual changes to dna can happen and

767
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,640
epigenetic changes

768
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,880
if and and because of all that you know

769
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,400
decades and decades of research

770
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,720
most of us in the cannabis tissue

771
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,919
culture industry know that

772
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,600
and we are cognitive of

773
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,038
if even if we don't have molecular

774
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,278
markers or sequencing

775
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,119
everything is is there are there logical

776
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,679
approaches that we can take to

777
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,599
mitigate that or you know try to

778
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,600
mitigate that risk

779
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,719
there are because of all those decades

780
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,599
of research and

781
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,440
other plant species and so um it's

782
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,480
careful selection of your medias it's

783
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,278
it's it's looking for those that callous

784
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,200
those callus formations um you know at

785
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,558
the base of of your nodal plants

786
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,880
as you're doing your tissue culture for

787
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,720
example not not doing callus unless you

788
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,399
really want to so there are approaches

789
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,679
that are

790
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,839
you know well described and

791
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,519
at least we have a logical way to

792
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,319
approach it and then

793
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,599
ideally after uh plants gone through

794
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,439
culture that you

795
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,719
even if you're not sequencing it you

796
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,159
should be flat you know we obviously

797
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,679
want to flower it out make sure it still

798
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,480
has the same chemical profile because

799
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,640
clonal tissue culture should not change

800
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,319
what its dna potential what its genetic

801
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,480
potential should be it shouldn't

802
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,158
be introducing you know genes for

803
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,120
limonene for example to create new

804
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,600
terpenes unless

805
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,119
but unless that plant actually already

806
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,000
had the genetic code to be able to

807
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,119
produce that

808
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,319
um particular um compound

809
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:09,678
so you do the um flowering out you look

810
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,480
for the chemical profile but you also

811
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,798
look for

812
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,399
the architecture and the group the habit

813
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,960
of this particular

814
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:17,839
strain so if it's a strain that you know

815
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,798
very well

816
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,558
you know likely what its growth habit is

817
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,158
and you know what its chemical profile

818
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,519
should be and it should

819
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,600
be performing um

820
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,960
pretty damn well compared to what what

821
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,079
what you started with

822
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,960
before you gave it um a a tissue culture

823
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,960
bath shall we say

824
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,558
no that's really fascinating and at the

825
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,640
risk of

826
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,319
the risk of plugging medicinal genomics

827
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,880
yet again

828
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,639
we recently came out with a snip chip

829
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,440
which is sort of a more cost effective

830
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,038
way to

831
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,558
to get some sequencing information on

832
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,798
the plant without having to do you know

833
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,119
full-on sequencing it's more of a snip

834
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,000
panel and i wonder if a tool like that

835
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,798
would be useful

836
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,159
for tissue culture um just to you know

837
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,839
screen against

838
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,200
the original plant to just make sure

839
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,359
that there's no

840
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,798
differentiation between the the snips

841
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,000
that are being called

842
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:15,200
my god man yes the simple answer is just

843
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,359
yes um you know i think

844
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,440
any of us doing plant tissue culture

845
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,719
would love to be able to

846
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,038
to utilize tools like that whether

847
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
with a third party and sending it off or

848
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,839
in-house but

849
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,119
just yes absolutely and

850
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:36,639
my my favorite

851
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,558
my favorite r d and thing to do

852
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,559
in this industry is to be working with

853
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:44,480
breeders and and other growers

854
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:46,720
on on on a a breeder spending a lot of

855
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,880
time the good breeders um

856
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,919
to generate these new genetics right and

857
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,240
so

858
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,360
they should be rewarded for that i want

859
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,519
to be able to

860
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,759
to get their genetics out in the

861
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,519
marketplace and they should be able to

862
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,119
feel confident when their genetics are

863
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,240
in the marketplace that

864
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:07,359
their genetics are in fact true to type

865
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,480
that they are optimal so then that way

866
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,000
there's

867
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,038
um there's there's accountability

868
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,359
on on all ends that a the we get

869
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,200
we get to choose we're you know we are

870
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,000
the consumers right we get to choose

871
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,798
what we buy

872
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,839
who we do business with and and and all

873
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:25,519
of that

874
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,359
comes down to why would we want to do

875
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,639
that and and and to me

876
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,038
i would want to do business with

877
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,880
somebody who was in fact utilizing tools

878
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,879
like you were just describing

879
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,480
and then working with readers to be able

880
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,919
to protect the integrity of their

881
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,919
genetics but also be able to

882
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,640
protect their genetics right so if they

883
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,720
wanted to validate or if they want if

884
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,840
there was a dispute about genetics you

885
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,919
know um

886
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,079
it's it's been a long time for these

887
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,200
breeders to be able to say okay

888
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:57,038
i i spent years you know generating this

889
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,480
particular strain

890
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,319
my god you know the fact that it can

891
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,120
just get out there should be a choice

892
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,359
for them to make

893
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,158
not just because somebody can just take

894
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,079
it and

895
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,720
in horticulture and agriculture if you

896
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,119
see you know the hot new

897
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,159
um you know rose that's out on the

898
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,319
market

899
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,000
and there's a always a tag that goes

900
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,839
along with it the reason why there's a

901
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,359
tag is because those companies that

902
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:23,038
generated those particular

903
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:25,119
um cultivars are those

904
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,640
are getting paid right there's a royalty

905
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,398
that goes with that and if

906
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,799
some company ends up selling that

907
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:33,359
particular rose

908
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,240
without the proper licensing rights well

909
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,959
then

910
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,759
a obviously um you have the ability to

911
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,480
use

912
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,519
markers or snips and sequencing to be

913
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,880
able to

914
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,960
um you know to enforce your trademark

915
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,039
patent or whatever it might be

916
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,399
but then if somebody is actually growing

917
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,240
something of yours as well

918
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,079
you want to make sure that whoever is

919
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,679
selling that product or representing

920
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,639
that product on your behalf

921
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,320
is doing it in the right way and using

922
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,679
markers for example or just

923
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,439
understanding the genome

924
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,679
is a good way to actually have the best

925
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,278
understanding of in this environment

926
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,120
the plant when grown under these

927
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:10,398
conditions with these substrates with

928
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,918
this nutrient solution

929
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,079
so when you buy something again from a

930
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,000
nursery it typically comes with

931
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,519
those climate light and other

932
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
requirements because

933
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,359
if somebody's growing something of yours

934
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,840
and they're just excuse my language but

935
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,240
they're just

936
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,079
a shitty grower well that represents

937
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,519
that i mean it's a reflection of their

938
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,759
brand potentially

939
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,679
right and so all of these tools can be

940
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,480
used

941
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,559
for all aspects of our industry it's

942
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,640
just pretty complicated right now

943
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,639
as our industry is still very young

944
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,599
absolutely and that's a common common

945
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,759
refrain in a lot of these conversations

946
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,599
i'm having with folks is that you know

947
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,359
the industry has a lot of learning to do

948
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,959
has a lot of growing up to do we have a

949
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,079
lot to learn

950
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,960
um which is exciting i mean

951
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,519
bring it we get to be at that point and

952
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
it's

953
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,038
such a you know this is a

954
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,000
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be a

955
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,398
part of a

956
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,839
brand new industry and something that's

957
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:11,278
so huge

958
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:12,000
awesome definitely and that's why we

959
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,000
love doing

960
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,278
doing canmed as well to bring all these

961
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,558
people together from the different

962
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,640
facets of the

963
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:21,200
the industry whether it be cultivation

964
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,799
or safety testing or even the

965
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,278
healthcare professionals who are using

966
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:28,000
the medicine uh to treat patients too

967
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,119
um to really learn from each other and

968
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,398
kind of

969
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,000
see where we can help each other and

970
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,038
move this whole thing forward so that's

971
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,278
what's exciting

972
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,038
and you guys are really great at doing

973
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,519
that and for the education of everybody

974
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,200
because we all do want to learn right we

975
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,720
we don't want to stay small shitty

976
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,480
growers forever or

977
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,480
or struggling with a lot of this stuff

978
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,919
this is not why we do this so it's

979
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,519
awesome i mean you guys are really

980
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,559
really um important

981
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,480
uh avenues for this and so

982
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,319
we talked about how to use maybe tissue

983
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,919
culture to remediate plants that are

984
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,879
infected with pathogens but

985
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,399
i do know that your company um emerging

986
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,559
cannabis sciences you also

987
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,239
work with integrated pest management

988
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,159
systems to sort of maybe

989
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,358
prevent things like this from happening

990
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,119
um i was wondering if you could speak a

991
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,480
bit to that and kind of how that can be

992
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,200
used in cannabis

993
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,800
in hemp cultivation most important

994
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:21,519
acronym of my life

995
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,879
ipm um integrated pest management um

996
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,960
it is the most important um thing in

997
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,639
any cannabis company and i don't care if

998
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,760
you're a company that only does retail

999
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,599
because

1000
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,879
you can't have a retail operation if you

1001
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,359
don't have any

1002
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,918
product to put in the shelves and if you

1003
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,639
don't

1004
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,199
actually care about the product on your

1005
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,800
shelf

1006
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,918
you know people are going to get wise

1007
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,119
and they're going to shop elsewhere

1008
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,638
right i mean we want

1009
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,280
good quality predictable

1010
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,639
product and the only way to do that is

1011
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,960
actually to be aware

1012
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,480
of all your cultural practices and it

1013
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,679
the the ipm

1014
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,719
um is absolutely critical it's it's

1015
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,399
about

1016
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,439
first of all the genetics as soon as

1017
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,119
they are coming into your your facility

1018
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,800
i think one of the biggest mistakes that

1019
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,240
i see um and i

1020
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,640
love seeing like the easy light bulb

1021
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,759
moment it's like everything must go into

1022
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,078
quarantine

1023
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,760
right so that's not a pesticide so

1024
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,720
integrated pest management isn't

1025
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,440
only about pesticides or scouting and

1026
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,879
looking for

1027
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,440
actual insects it is about how to

1028
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,280
mitigate that risk in general you'll

1029
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,358
always have problems as a grower

1030
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,480
what can we do to mitigate our risk and

1031
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:34,480
so it starts with

1032
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,079
as soon as you have genetics coming into

1033
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,480
your facility as clones

1034
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,800
or if you're popping seeds you've got to

1035
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,400
have some sort of place to be able to

1036
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,880
isolate those plants

1037
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,400
until you have an understanding of their

1038
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,358
health status before you

1039
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,160
introduce them into your you know mother

1040
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,039
population

1041
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,559
and to me that's probably the number one

1042
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,440
thing that most companies

1043
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,400
don't they may think about it or maybe

1044
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,599
they're not

1045
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,838
i'm sure how to go about it and it does

1046
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,880
take space out of your growing and you

1047
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,799
know um

1048
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,800
square footage and and so a lot of times

1049
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,880
nobody necessarily wants to do that and

1050
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,240
so but it has to be done

1051
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,838
because almost well everything that i

1052
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,679
see in cannabis when it comes to any

1053
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,239
disease

1054
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:25,039
happens through mechanical transmission

1055
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:27,118
and if you are bringing in

1056
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,800
i take in people's problems for a living

1057
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,838
so i'll i'll you know get

1058
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,320
um hemp genetics and i'm opening up

1059
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:34,960
literally a mite bomb right because i'm

1060
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,079
getting these

1061
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,639
these cuts and then i'm we're checking

1062
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,640
them in

1063
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:41,920
which is another thing that is really

1064
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,639
critical um for

1065
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,599
uh ipm uh strategy what i mean by

1066
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,358
checking them in while

1067
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,039
physically looking at the damn thing

1068
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:50,159
before i you know just throw it in a

1069
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,039
population i

1070
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,879
have a uh it doesn't you don't have to

1071
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,880
have something crazy expensive just a

1072
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,358
microscope that allows you to be able to

1073
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,000
see

1074
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:00,559
things like russet mites and small eggs

1075
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,480
um

1076
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,239
but yeah so you're i'm opening up and

1077
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,838
it's just like oh

1078
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,679
russet mites right so what am i going to

1079
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:08,799
do am i going to just throw that into my

1080
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,598
population no i

1081
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,640
i now then have to have the next step

1082
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,400
what do i do

1083
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,838
for all incoming plants i need to be

1084
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,559
able to isolate it i need to have a

1085
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,400
strategy

1086
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,199
for any what pesticides i can use in my

1087
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,200
state what i

1088
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:24,719
should be using what i what i shouldn't

1089
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,719
be using and then

1090
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,559
immediately make sure that my staff is

1091
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,519
appropriately trained to be able to

1092
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,838
handle and and do all of that and then

1093
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,559
follow it up with a specific regime so

1094
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:36,400
this is again

1095
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,159
all independent of tissue culture but i

1096
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,079
do the same thing

1097
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:44,159
in my own lab so i'll have um

1098
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,320
grow tents and i actually you know those

1099
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,759
disposable gowns in hospitals the yellow

1100
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,880
ones that you see everybody wearing all

1101
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,040
the time

1102
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,119
so i'll actually take that and i on the

1103
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:56,880
inside i'll duct tape that around

1104
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,320
any orifice of the tent right so

1105
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,559
because i don't want anything to get in

1106
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,160
and i don't want anything to get out

1107
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,599
if that's all we can do then that's all

1108
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:04,078
we can do but at least we're doing

1109
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,640
something

1110
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,280
and then only certain people can go in

1111
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,759
and out

1112
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,720
and then i'm only putting something into

1113
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,400
my

1114
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:16,480
um general population once i know

1115
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,320
i'm not introducing a white bomb to the

1116
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,358
rest of the other moms because

1117
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,000
guess what's going to happen and and the

1118
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,239
mothers

1119
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,760
are the most important most valuable

1120
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,279
thing in any company

1121
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,880
because if something happens to your

1122
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,000
mothers if we don't

1123
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,440
quickly quickly identify which means

1124
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,838
you have to train your staff on what to

1125
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,639
look for and then immediately

1126
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,159
get rid of it yes it might be the last

1127
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,639
one of that strain but if it

1128
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,399
has a virus or a viroid unless you're

1129
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,480
going to immediately remove it and put

1130
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,400
it in your tissue culture facility or to

1131
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,800
another tissue culture company

1132
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,838
you will spread that disease you

1133
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,079
absolutely will

1134
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,679
so why around let's get rid of it

1135
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,760
let's move it out

1136
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,519
and yes you're gonna have to source

1137
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,240
another genetic if that's your last one

1138
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,960
but

1139
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,358
it's either that or it's going to be you

1140
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,199
know

1141
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,639
within probably the you know six months

1142
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,439
to the next two years

1143
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,039
you know you can expect to see a

1144
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,200
significant decrease in your yields over

1145
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,838
time so

1146
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,118
paying staff to to be vigilant about

1147
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:21,440
identifying it

1148
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,960
um purchasing clean stock from companies

1149
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,720
that actually can provide a different

1150
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,800
type of coa is another thing

1151
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,519
um that i think is really critical for

1152
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,119
us all to become educated and get

1153
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,960
in a habit of asking about we know how

1154
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,640
to ask for coas when it comes to

1155
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,280
chemical profiles

1156
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,960
or compliance for state but there are

1157
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,040
agriculture laboratories and

1158
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,039
companies like you that do this testing

1159
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,119
and work with companies like mine that

1160
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,320
say okay i'm doing this process when it

1161
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,640
leaves my hands

1162
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,079
here's the test report that shows at

1163
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:51,920
least when i tested it for

1164
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,119
these particular diseases it was

1165
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,838
negative

1166
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,838
so you know at that point can we say

1167
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:59,199
disease free or virus free well

1168
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,119
at least when it's leaving my hands

1169
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:04,000
according to the coa

1170
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,880
um it appears that it's it's testing

1171
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,719
negative

1172
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,240
i think we all need to understand that

1173
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,358
we should start asking for that

1174
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,358
because i don't want to bring anything

1175
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,239
into my house

1176
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:14,799
unless i know that at least that bare

1177
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,000
minimum

1178
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,839
um has been done um especially since i'm

1179
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,679
oftentimes spending a hell of a lot of

1180
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,279
money for these genetics right

1181
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:27,039
um so so i think um and then just

1182
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,560
it's you've got to have a sanitation

1183
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,719
process in and and

1184
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,039
there's so many good resources about how

1185
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,919
to do ipm scouting why you would want to

1186
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,599
do that

1187
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,880
and then consultants like myself and

1188
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,559
many other consultants around the

1189
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,079
country this is what we do we help train

1190
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,519
your teams we help bring that

1191
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,920
method in um and then it's

1192
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,838
just a learn curve it's just like yeah

1193
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,280
nobody likes to wear a mask but

1194
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:50,639
you know i don't think about it anymore

1195
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,880
but i can't tell you at the beginning

1196
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,559
how many times i'd have to turn around

1197
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,318
right before i get to the the door of

1198
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,279
the damn store because i left the mask

1199
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:59,679
in my car right

1200
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,720
but i don't do that anymore so it will

1201
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:04,000
take some time

1202
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:06,000
and it has to be accepted and practiced

1203
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,519
and prioritized from the top down

1204
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,800
because

1205
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,318
if somebody doesn't want to pay for

1206
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,240
testing are you going to throw that plan

1207
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:14,559
away if somebody you know if if the boss

1208
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,439
is like oh my god that's my strain blah

1209
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,039
blah what

1210
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,639
okay but what do you want me to do with

1211
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,838
it as the grower right and if your boss

1212
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,118
is telling you to keep it and you have

1213
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:22,559
no place to put it

1214
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,280
this is how these companies are getting

1215
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,440
themselves into trouble and so i think

1216
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,839
there's a few things to learn and then

1217
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,838
there's just the cultural practices that

1218
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,599
there's so many great resources out

1219
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:34,239
there companies and consultants to help

1220
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,599
you

1221
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:40,078
if just get you over the hump

1222
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,760
yeah and you and you mentioned masks and

1223
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,680
sort of this whole

1224
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,960
shared pandemic experience that we're

1225
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,399
all going through and

1226
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,960
i wonder if if cultivators and growers

1227
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,400
will be

1228
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,240
more aware of potential

1229
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,720
infestations whether it be from viruses

1230
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,239
or pests or anything like that

1231
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:59,759
sort of because we're all going through

1232
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,479
this experience and it's

1233
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,680
it's been so top of mind and maybe

1234
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,358
you're already seeing that are you

1235
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:06,799
seeing that cultivators are being much

1236
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,358
more cognizant of

1237
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,200
you know potential infections you know

1238
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:11,519
it's a really good question i will tell

1239
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,759
you

1240
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,639
um the immediate thing that i have

1241
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,560
noticed is

1242
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,960
i don't have to explain as much people

1243
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,159
it's get it now

1244
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,280
it can get virus because when i started

1245
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,239
giving these um talks it really actually

1246
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,319
took like a year

1247
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,598
before people would believe truly

1248
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,000
believe that

1249
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,039
plants can get a virus or a viroid and

1250
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,960
so i was like oh my god yes it can

1251
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,559
and again that was just because why

1252
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,440
would they need to know that before

1253
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:43,199
um so anyway so and then the idea of

1254
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,480
like okay these cultural practices of

1255
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:46,239
wearing gloves

1256
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,599
so when i started the industry a little

1257
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,039
over five years ago

1258
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,800
i was working for a company and they

1259
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,559
still when they were doing the pinching

1260
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,599
they were still doing that

1261
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,799
with their thumbnail with no gloves

1262
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,519
and i was like why would you do that

1263
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,720
um because you know having had the

1264
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,960
experience working with

1265
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,759
with plant diseases i mean it's just i

1266
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,358
would never

1267
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,800
in a million years think to do that but

1268
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,318
that's because i've gone through it and

1269
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,640
this company hadn't gone through that

1270
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,000
yet

1271
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:15,838
so yeah everybody we put ppe stations

1272
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,039
and and the first thing i do for most my

1273
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,440
consultants is

1274
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,239
where are your ppe stations so the uh

1275
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,358
protective

1276
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:26,959
um uh supplies that we need like gloves

1277
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:29,440
and and and and the refills for your

1278
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,039
your bleach or your vircon for your

1279
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,800
shears and stuff that it's actually

1280
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:33,519
killing the virus because you can't use

1281
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,318
alcohol

1282
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,920
um little thing for everybody out there

1283
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,039
so where is all of those supplies

1284
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,680
i call those the ppe stations well guess

1285
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,159
what

1286
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,759
i know how i am and if i have to get up

1287
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,159
to go get a new pair of gloves

1288
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,760
my god i'm not going to do it right make

1289
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,279
it easy for me make it easy for

1290
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,800
everybody just to be able to do it you

1291
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,560
don't want to have a box of gloves just

1292
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,880
at one door on the entry you want to

1293
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:56,719
have

1294
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,880
gloves and gloves of every size and have

1295
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:01,039
stations throughout your facility

1296
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,800
and then it becomes people will do it

1297
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:06,880
it's not like they don't want to do it

1298
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,039
it's just if you if it's not you know

1299
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,480
you know planned and actually done in a

1300
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,279
way that's going to be successful for

1301
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,880
people then

1302
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,400
you know it gets to be up to a point

1303
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,519
where it's like ah forget it you know

1304
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,440
i'm not gonna

1305
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,119
if i can't find anything i'm gonna use

1306
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,039
alcohol at least i'm using alcohol

1307
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,160
um well that's the worst thing we want

1308
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,759
to do for

1309
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,399
uh virus because unlike with people and

1310
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,240
we can use

1311
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,079
you know hand sanitizer and alcohol and

1312
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,239
you saw all that happen with

1313
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,599
the the data in the literature is that

1314
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,439
alcohol is not

1315
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,760
really the most effective thing for for

1316
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,200
plant uh viruses and viroids and

1317
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,960
that's why you've got to use the bleach

1318
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:42,559
and other products that have been tested

1319
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,760
and shown out there like virkon that

1320
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:45,358
will work

1321
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,119
you've got to leave that stuff out you

1322
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,920
have to have it prepped up i mean just

1323
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,559
make it easy for everybody and so

1324
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,039
since the pandemic it has been very easy

1325
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,960
for

1326
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,559
these companies to get it they get it

1327
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,639
quickly

1328
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,159
um and they understand mechanical

1329
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,639
transmission

1330
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,519
more now than i think anybody would ever

1331
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,879
want to

1332
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:08,639
unless you do what i do well that's an

1333
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,880
interesting point about alcohol not

1334
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,719
being an effective

1335
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,400
sanitation method maybe for lack of a

1336
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,078
better term when it comes to plants

1337
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,400
that's interesting i didn't know that

1338
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,200
it will work with a lot of other like

1339
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,800
fungal

1340
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:25,759
and bacterial um um

1341
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,160
microbial contaminants um and and i

1342
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,560
think a lot more needs to be done

1343
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,480
to see what products out there are in

1344
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,279
fact effective against

1345
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,240
specific or particular plant viruses or

1346
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,680
viroids

1347
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,039
the reason why there's going to be a

1348
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:40,078
different mode of action is because

1349
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:43,039
we're talking about

1350
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,400
different kinds of things so a dna or

1351
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,199
rna

1352
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,838
molecule versus you know a single cell

1353
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:51,039
organism

1354
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:52,000
right so there you can ima you can

1355
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,358
understand

1356
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,880
thinking about it from that approach

1357
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:55,199
that different chemicals are going to

1358
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,680
have

1359
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,879
different effects on on those on those

1360
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,000
things so

1361
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,079
yeah the the much of the literature out

1362
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,400
there uh looking and at least studying

1363
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,960
things like uh tobacco mosaic viruses

1364
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,720
which is one of the worst things um to

1365
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,800
get because it's

1366
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,480
damn near impossible to eradicate even

1367
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,880
with plant tissue culture

1368
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,760
and it just is persistent it i mean it

1369
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,800
will stay

1370
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,760
in you know soil or water or or i mean

1371
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,160
it'll just stay

1372
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,599
there as as a kind of a latent particle

1373
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,078
until it gets into

1374
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,280
a favorable environment and then off it

1375
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,760
goes again

1376
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,880
um same with the hop latent viroid right

1377
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,079
um we don't

1378
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,160
quite understand the mechanism of of

1379
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,440
a its duration how long it you know is

1380
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,279
it viable for what

1381
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,880
environmental parameters can really kill

1382
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,359
it but there's still

1383
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,800
quite a bit of data out there to show

1384
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,559
it's a tough one and

1385
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,480
when they did some studies and field

1386
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:53,759
trials this was

1387
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,280
gosh i think back in the 80s and over in

1388
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,079
germany or the uk

1389
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,400
they were looking at field studies of

1390
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,720
hop

1391
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,480
late and viroid and and they were

1392
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,879
studying to see how they could treat the

1393
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,719
farm

1394
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,720
or the fields right so if you're

1395
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,399
planting this crop and think about the

1396
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,519
hot uh hemp farmers

1397
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,280
if you're planting seed that came from

1398
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:14,000
infected moms with a hot plate and

1399
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,319
viroid

1400
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,440
and the probability of those seeds being

1401
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,920
infected is

1402
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,559
really high well that's going to be now

1403
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,318
in your soil so now you have soil

1404
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,319
and there's a lot of marijuana growers

1405
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,759
out there too outdoors and in the fields

1406
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:30,480
so now you haven't

1407
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,680
and your soil is in at least infected

1408
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,960
with these

1409
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,679
um virus what do you do and so they were

1410
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,119
looking to see

1411
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,358
what chemicals and compounds that they

1412
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,000
could use but also with the

1413
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,960
farm equipment looking at their blades

1414
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,800
during harvest

1415
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,159
and what they needed to do and really

1416
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,960
when it comes down to it we're still

1417
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:48,399
looking at

1418
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,079
the same thing that we've known for a

1419
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,200
long time and it comes down to bleach

1420
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,519
and a few

1421
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,759
other chemicals out there that are on

1422
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,639
the market but

1423
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,000
10 bleach my friend it's tough on the

1424
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,480
sheers but

1425
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,079
would you rather you know suffer with

1426
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,838
losing your moms and having to pay a

1427
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,599
bunch of companies to get

1428
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,759
like myself to clean them up or buy you

1429
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,359
know thousands and thousands of dollars

1430
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,920
in new genetics more frequently

1431
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,440
um than you would like or buy some

1432
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,480
shears every couple months

1433
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:21,519
i i think to me the the business answer

1434
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,838
there is pretty clear

1435
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:24,639
so you mentioned that some viruses or

1436
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,679
viroids

1437
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:29,920
might be difficult to tissue culture out

1438
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:32,000
um one of the things i wanted to ask you

1439
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,760
about is i know i'm kind of vaguely

1440
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,318
familiar with the idea of of keeping

1441
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,319
plants

1442
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,400
suspended in tissue culture as maybe

1443
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,159
like a preservation tactic

1444
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,000
um could that be like a feasible

1445
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:45,279
strategy to sort of

1446
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,318
have a tissue culture of a mom kind of

1447
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,319
just in case

1448
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:49,920
that mom does get sick instead of trying

1449
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:50,719
to tissue culture something out you

1450
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,400
could

1451
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,000
sort of create a new one out of clean

1452
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,119
stock is that um

1453
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,838
is that a strategy yeah yeah it is and i

1454
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,559
have

1455
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,239
many customers that actually uh do that

1456
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,319
because you don't want to keep

1457
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,759
you know your your entire library

1458
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,558
doesn't need to be you know

1459
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,640
living in in your mother's space so

1460
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,760
that's one advantage for doing that

1461
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,118
um and you can companies uh you know

1462
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,880
when we do plant tissue culture there's

1463
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,519
a couple ways that we can maintain that

1464
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,880
stock

1465
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,480
um oh with the fires too or or the

1466
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,280
hurricanes right if something just

1467
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,358
happens and

1468
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,960
and everything's gone because well

1469
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:27,598
i mean everything that happened this

1470
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,960
past

1471
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,800
several years and this past year in

1472
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,199
particular is horrible

1473
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,119
so if you lose everything and because

1474
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,879
you're just trying to save yourself um

1475
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,318
uh and you lose your genetics what are

1476
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,280
you gonna do well

1477
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,558
um week um so we do this and this is a

1478
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,599
service that we provide

1479
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:48,960
um where we can do uh seed

1480
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,720
banking so we can do that in um

1481
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,559
liquid nitrogen so there's gene banks

1482
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,239
plant gene banks all over the world and

1483
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,000
and and they do this with liquid

1484
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:56,558
nitrogen so just like you have you've

1485
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,639
heard of

1486
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:02,960
uh you know are for stem cells and cell

1487
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:03,838
um those kinds of banks but plant

1488
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,920
banking is

1489
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:07,599
a very common thing and we just have to

1490
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,119
do the r d and that's what i've spent

1491
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,200
the last several years actually

1492
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,480
you know fiddling around with in my lab

1493
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,639
here in tempe

1494
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,559
is is to actually work through that

1495
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,480
again we start with kind of known stuff

1496
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,880
out in the literature that's worked

1497
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,800
in other similar plant species and we

1498
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,280
just start things like can we just keep

1499
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,680
it in

1500
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,599
like refrigerated like temperatures for

1501
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,598
a longer period of time than

1502
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,119
keeping it on the shelf and having to

1503
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,599
you know actively

1504
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,200
keeps um subculturing it every couple

1505
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,160
months in media drying out and this kind

1506
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,318
of stuff

1507
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,318
yeah we can can we actually preserve it

1508
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:40,759
in liquid nitrogen so we call it you

1509
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,558
know

1510
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:47,359
cryopreservation um as seed and tissue

1511
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,400
absolutely and so that's that's huge

1512
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,960
because again if

1513
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,400
if you want to have instead of limiting

1514
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,800
yourself to the number

1515
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,800
of strains in your library based off of

1516
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,000
square footage in your mom room well now

1517
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,400
it's a

1518
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,199
couple tubes in a deer tank or some

1519
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,720
shelf space

1520
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:06,639
and a walk-in cooler or with

1521
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,318
nurseries and companies like myself and

1522
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:11,279
so that i think those are

1523
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,960
all advantages uh to the industry for

1524
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,200
for tissue culture

1525
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,800
again this is early days for companies

1526
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,799
um that are doing this

1527
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,240
um tissue culture and preservation and

1528
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
it's just important to know they're not

1529
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:22,719
gonna have

1530
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,559
all the answers just yet and they're

1531
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:25,919
they're the good companies should tell

1532
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,240
you what they've done

1533
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,920
what's still not necessarily done like

1534
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:32,479
you know i haven't been in business

1535
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,400
and and and been able to pull tissue or

1536
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,318
seed out you know five years after being

1537
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,639
preserved in liquid nitrogen

1538
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:39,679
and check for viability nobody has right

1539
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:41,279
so

1540
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,960
but companies should be open to have

1541
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,319
that dialogue with anybody who's

1542
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,559
interested in those services

1543
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,838
and and it should i think let the

1544
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,359
industry know that

1545
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,199
at least this is a company with some

1546
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,318
integrity and and we're all going to

1547
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:54,399
give it the best shot

1548
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,440
but and also there's no research out

1549
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,160
there right so

1550
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,838
like the hop industry well there's hops

1551
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:03,598
industry associations where

1552
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:04,078
you know um every um all poundage that's

1553
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,400
sold

1554
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,119
goes a certain fraction of that goes

1555
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,119
into

1556
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,838
uh for research and development as an

1557
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,838
industry to pay for things for studying

1558
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:15,679
all of these viruses and virals and

1559
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:17,440
other diseases and hops

1560
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:19,598
we're so young as an industry we have

1561
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,679
nothing like that and so these companies

1562
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,838
like myself who are out there and and

1563
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:24,799
are providing these services are doing

1564
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:28,318
it

1565
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,920
all on our own and and yes

1566
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,920
it's going to take a little bit longer

1567
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,680
for that but at least know that it's

1568
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,838
coming and then companies like yours

1569
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,358
that are providing services so i use

1570
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,440
the services all the time because i

1571
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,279
don't necessarily have the sequencing or

1572
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,639
being able to do the arrays within my

1573
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,040
own facility

1574
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,879
um you know i hope to grow up and one

1575
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:47,279
day and be able to have a lab like that

1576
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,519
too

1577
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,480
and so um it's just all a matter of time

1578
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:52,000
and baby

1579
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,440
but at least there's more companies like

1580
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,079
ours that are out there providing the

1581
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,159
services

1582
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,760
and and as consumers of those

1583
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:01,598
products and services we have to just

1584
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,160
learn to ask better questions and know

1585
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,359
what the pros cons and and and you know

1586
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:09,199
yet to be determined are

1587
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:11,598
and yet again just another example of

1588
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,919
how um

1589
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,920
or just another example of sort of the

1590
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,519
value of everyone coming together at an

1591
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,519
annual event like a canmed

1592
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,880
to to share what we've learned we've

1593
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,679
learned over the past year

1594
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,800
and continue to help each other sort of

1595
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:26,799
grow up and

1596
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,000
move this whole industry forward so i

1597
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,760
think maybe that's a good place to

1598
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,519
start i know that i've i've kept you

1599
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,760
long over the the time that i

1600
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,119
i promised i would keep you and i

1601
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,640
promised i would have

1602
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,280
a lot to offer so i i appreciate your

1603

1606

and i miss being in person but we still

1608
