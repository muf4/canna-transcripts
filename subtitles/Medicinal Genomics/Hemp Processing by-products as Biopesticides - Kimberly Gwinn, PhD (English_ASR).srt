1
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,800
hello and like the last two speakers

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,599
this is my first canmed uh talk so I am

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,240
delighted to be here and thank you to

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,240
the organizers for inviting

5
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:32,079
me um first I would like to acknowledge

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,840
my collaborat on this project Dewey Tren

7
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,160
is an undergraduate researcher in my

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,800
laboratory he's did the work on the army

9
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,599
worms that we'll discuss later uh Tony

10
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,878
Wong is a professor and an Institute

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,120
professor at the University of Tennessee

12
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:48,159
in the department of Food Science she

13
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:49,280
and her lab came up with the technology

14
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,279
to make the

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,280
nanoemulsions and Zach Hansen is a uh

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,399
plant pathologist and he did the work on

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,920
powdering mildew he was at the

18
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,920
University of Tennessee and now he's

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,920
associated with Cornell

20
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:10,719
University um we hear a lot in this

21
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,920
uh conference about the importance of

22
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,679
hemp and the importance to human health

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,840
it's also very important for animal

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,159
health so if we look at the one Health

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,118
con concept where I want to focus our

26
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:27,320
talk today is on the third component

27
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,319
which is the Environmental

28
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:34,680
Health in h we have have uh very good

29
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:38,039
products we have the

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,560
cannabinoids and but we also have a lot

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,640
of other things that are produced so we

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,519
have the spent hemp is which is now

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,478
being used in many states as animal feed

34
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:52,359
it can also be used to generate

35
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,679
fibers uh grower extractors recycle

36
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:58,640
their solvents so the things that are

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:03,439
left over are what we are using and that

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:06,478
is this small amount here which is the

39
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,959
byproduct of hemp extraction so if we

40
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:13,120
can find a good use for this then we

41
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,439
will have completed the entire cycle for

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,920
uh this particular plant so it has

43
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,919
little or no environmental

44
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:26,238
impact so that's what we decided to take

45
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:29,639
on we took the hemp plant we went to the

46
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,080
extractors and uh they took the products

47
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,518
and we took what was leftover I've often

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,000
called this our leftovers uh project we

49
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,239
submitted that to uh a

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,360
microfluidizer with uh grass uh

51
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,719
surfactant grass simply means generally

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,360
regarded as safe this is an incredibly

53
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,560
safe product you could eat it but I

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,000
don't recommend it but uh so what we did

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,158
in the microfluidizer is make simply

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,439
make this into a nanoemulsion these are

57
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,560
very very small molecules suspended in a

58
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,239
liquid

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,920
if you think about salad dressing when

60
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,120
you mix oil and water when you do that

61
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:11,039
you get that quick Emulsion well this is

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,920
a stable Emulsion that looks similar to

63
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,079
that uh what's in that Emulsion is

64
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,359
whatever is left over uh in this first

65
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,440
batch it was very high still in the

66
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,560
cannabinoids that particular extractor

67
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:31,759
didn't have a uh good extraction of the

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,759
full uh CBD that was mainly CBD so

69
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:38,598
so we did um a distillation to get rid

70
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,040
of the cannabinoids and really conf uh

71
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:42,518
concentrate on the tping because the

72
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,919
tping are the things that we are

73
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,640
interested in for insecticidal and

74
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,639
fungicidal

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,680
products so if we look at what happened

76
00:03:50,438 --> 00:04:00,479
to our DPT which is this distilled uh

77
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:04,480
tpin we are mostly uh car offing visal

78
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:07,878
and hubing all cesa tpin the minor tpin

79
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:10,318
included mostly the mono tpin and uh

80
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,438
some other

81
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,439
terpenoids and I'm using tpine and

82
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:18,238
turpenoid interchangeably in this

83
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,600
talk they aren't the same and I and I

84
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,758
understand that so it I'll throughout

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,720
the talk I'll use several abbreviations

86
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,720
one is DPT and that is our distilled

87
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,639
byproduct uh TP which is our crude

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,520
byproduct NE is simply our negative

89
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:38,439
control which is uh surfactant only no

90
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:43,439
turpins and Ne which is our positive

91
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:46,478
control it is a well regarded U

92
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:50,000
biopesticide so one of the problems with

93
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:53,519
natural products is shelf life so with

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,680
the um Nano imulsion we get a stable

95
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,918
product it does get a little cloudy

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,360
after 30 days but I've used some of

97
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,079
these products up to 6 months to two

98
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,038
years and it's still they still have

99
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,839
activity um it's hard to see on this

100
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:10,319
thing but there's a little tiny yellow

101
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,839
bar there that is 20 microns so these

102
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,000
are very very small

103
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,279
molecules uh of these nanoemulsions

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,360
these liquid these surfactants and

105
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,359
Tarpin together suspended in

106
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,560
water so our first experiment was just a

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,038
proof of Concepts so we worked with Bean

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,720
Beetle we work with Bean Beetle for two

109
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:38,079
reasons uh it's available commercially

110
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,319
it's easy to get it's easy to rear and

111
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:45,198
it's a model insect for testing this

112
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:49,960
type of thing it is uh what we did is we

113
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,919
put the beans in the in a flask uh then

114
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:55,279
put that out on a piece of uh filter

115
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,000
paper after we dried them we put two

116
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:01,359
pairs of uh beetles in there so they

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,639
would mate and then we allowed

118
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,000
them to lay their eggs on the surface

119
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,879
this particular insect lays its eggs and

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,918
then the lar burry into the bean itself

121
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,478
completely making the bean uh

122
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,399
unacceptable for com

123
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,879
consumption and then at the end we did a

124
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,839
number of things we counted the numbers

125
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,560
of eggs and everything but what I'm

126
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,918
going to report today is basically our

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:31,319
data on uh how many adults emerged but

128
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:31,318
all this data is published

129
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:39,680
in the paper Fay uh at Al so basically

130
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:43,240
what we saw was with the we treated only

131
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,240
with a nano imulsion we got about 15

132
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,199
adults uh per dish that came out whereas

133
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,038
when we put these other uh treatments on

134
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:57,038
there we we lowered the amount uh with a

135
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:59,959
5% TP and a 5% uh

136
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:02,959
dtp so we were very excited about we

137
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,478
thought this is a great way to

138
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,079
um start thinking about this as a

139
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:13,878
potential uh control for this pest this

140
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:17,959
pest can cause a 90% loss of uh cow peas

141
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:21,560
in uh in storage so it's very important

142
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:23,918
for people who are legume storage

143
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,839
producers uh we looked at that in terms

144
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:29,079
of the economic loss as follows the

145
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,198
exact same data Trend as the adults per

146
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:34,079
dish

147
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:38,560
and basically uh we see that if we had

148
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:42,038
the uh economic loss of about you know

149
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,839
40% with the nanoemulsion alone then we

150
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:50,598
were down to less than 5% with our best

151
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,598
treatment which was the uh 5%

152
00:07:53,279 --> 00:08:01,038
dtp so at the time uh Zack Hansen's uh

153
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,719
graduate student uh was dealing with

154
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,560
some powdery mildew of hemp he was

155
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,039
running uh trials so we said oh can we

156
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,560
put this in your trial so in the first

157
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:15,478
trial we had the TP in the trial but we

158
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,519
did not have the ne because we were just

159
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,598
jumping into the experiment

160
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,120
Midway and anyway so if we look at the

161
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,959
area under the this progress curve which

162
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,478
is a common way that plant Pathologists

163
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:31,359
measure how much disease is there then

164
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:35,519
we see that uh in the water we had a

165
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,599
very high response but with the the

166
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,080
biopesticides that he tested and this

167
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,039
was strictly biopesticides we saw a

168
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,399
reduction uh of our material very very

169
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:48,919
similar to that of the common

170
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,240
biopesticides that are used to treat

171
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:55,559
powdery mildew and hemp in the second

172
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,839
run of this the second trial we actually

173
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,359
looked at um our nanoemulsion and we saw

174
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,360
the same type type of response with our

175
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,759
Nano ulion alone and also our

176
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
nanoemulsion with the Turing so we feel

177
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,200
very confident that this is a great way

178
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:15,000
to control powdery mildew of him

179
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,040
and we uh decided to go a little bit

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,360
further but but this time we needed to

181
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,519
get a new formulation so we went to

182
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,720
another extractor so we have no control

183
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,159
over what's coming into our system so

184
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,680
the first thing we did was uh look at

185
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:32,278
this this time we sent it off to a a

186
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,919
company new bloom in uh chattan

187
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,879
Tennessee and we found that basically in

188
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,240
this time we have very few

189
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,958
cannabinoids and mostly cesco

190
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,639
Turin so we decided to use this without

191
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,919
doing the distillation because the

192
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,919
distillation if you're coming into

193
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,639
product formulation is a very

194
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:57,278
expensive um process so we decided to

195
00:09:53,639 --> 00:10:00,360
look at uh pathogens and

196
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:03,919
pests so the pathogen

197
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,399
is uh powdering me another powdering

198
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:10,120
mildew and then we decided to look at

199
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,120
caterpillars or lepidopteran

200
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,680
larvey so with powdery Milo of squash if

201
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,919
you aren't a plant mythologist you

202
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,399
probably don't know this but powdery

203
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:22,399
Milos are very specific to their host so

204
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,519
uh this is not the same as the powdery

205
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,600
mildew of him uh but we got the same

206
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,600
response in this experiment though we

207
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,399
did add some chemical controls these are

208
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,079
shown in green the other biopesticides

209
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,440
are shown in gold and ours is in this

210
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:42,679
deep orange and we basically got with

211
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,839
our TP we got as good of control as you

212
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:48,078
get with a synthetic pesticide so once

213
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,079
again this tells us that we are doing

214
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,679
the right thing to control powdering

215
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:56,759
Builders uh and we can get a somewhat of

216
00:10:53,679 --> 00:11:00,479
a benefit if we have the TP in there

217
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:02,838
compared to the Nano Emulsion but that

218
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,000
difference is not statistically

219
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,440
significant but is also not

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,240
statistically significant from the best

221
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,279
uh powdery mildew uh product that we

222
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,278
could find at that

223
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:23,600
time so we uh went to a different system

224
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,719
looking at uh toxicity so this is if we

225
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,519
feed it to the insect we make them eat

226
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,680
it what happens and in this case we used

227
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,720
the nanom Motions we incorporated it

228
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:38,120
into artificial diet this artificial

229
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,720
diet was used to rear the ri the insects

230
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,120
from third instar which is the hardest

231
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,320
instar one of the harder instars to kill

232
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,200
most people start do this in very early

233
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,839
in stars and

234
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:57,720
then uh we fed this and we watched what

235
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:59,839
happened and in this uh study we had

236
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,560
water as our control we had a

237
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,079
uh Nano ulion control and we had two

238
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:09,078
doses of the TP and the Nano Emulsion

239
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,599
the low dose and a high dose and we did

240
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:14,078
not see any statistical difference in

241
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,079
the uh mortality of the insects and the

242
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:21,599
low dose but in the high dose we did so

243
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:24,319
this high dose is uh very would be very

244
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,720
important for using to control fall army

245
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,079
worm uh if you don't know about fall

246
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,040
army worm fall army worm is a very

247
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:36,120
invasive pest you can in the US it's

248
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,360
estimated to uh cause losses of about

249
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,919
$200

250
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,519
million and that is uh one of the

251
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:46,039
reasons we targeted it also because it

252
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,440
is also a model insect and we can

253
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,439
compare to a lot of other

254
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:57,320
studies so we also decided to look at

255
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:01,159
beat army worm beat army worm is a very

256
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,600
close relative of the Fall Army worm uh

257
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:07,039
different different species in the same

258
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,680
genus and the bead army worm there was

259
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:13,120
no impact so we don't have a good

260
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,559
explanation for this as of yet we are we

261
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,720
are looking at some of the digestive

262
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:21,159
enzymes and this type of thing that

263
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,959
would uh help help us get a clue but we

264
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:26,399
don't have a reason for this yet so

265
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:29,439
we're trying to to uh to find that

266
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:33,198
out but it is also not a real

267
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,199
significant past of crops in the

268
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,360
US the last thing I'm going to talk

269
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:44,639
about is a uh we started looking at well

270
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:47,519
if if a uh biotrophic pathogen is uh

271
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,079
affected how what is the effect on a a

272
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,839
pathogen like

273
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:54,519
fusarium and so we did what we call a

274
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,560
poison food study poison food studies

275
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,440
are simply in this case we took the

276
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:03,679
Emulsion we spread it across the top of

277
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:09,079
the uh media and then we put a plug of

278
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:09,078
fusarium in the center and monitored its

279
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,920
growth and in this experiment uh the

280
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,000
first time we used a fusarium oxysporum

281
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,159
and it is an isolate that that we

282
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,919
received from uh Bonnie only and it is a

283
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:29,120
isolate that was derived from

284
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:32,278
strawberries and we measured the days

285
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,078
each day we measured The Colony growth

286
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:37,360
and it became very obvious that we did

287
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:41,120
have a reduction in growth but the

288
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,680
reduction in growth is is consistent so

289
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:50,440
on day two day three uh the Nano

290
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:53,879
Emulsion is equal to the uh TP on day

291
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,759
four four and that Trend consists all

292
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:59,120
the way through so we really don't think

293
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,079
this is a great product to control

294
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,480
something like

295
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:06,799
fusarium uh but it does slow it down but

296
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,120
it doesn't really control it so we went

297
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:12,479
to an isolet that we have from hemp it

298
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,759
is probably a spor troides and asked the

299
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,039
same question got exactly the same

300
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:21,000
result so while I think this is a great

301
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:23,360
pesticide for the for the powdery MOS

302
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,919
being able to treat something the for

303
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,480
fusarium um may not work uh we are

304
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,599
currently looking at this as a seed

305
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,039
treatment and seeing uh what happens

306
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,600
when we put uh fuse area seed that has

307
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:41,719
fuse areia into the uh treatment and see

308
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,720
if we can get rid of fusarium that

309
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,919
way so in summary we've had two proof of

310
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,360
concept with the first proof of concept

311
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,958
we had that there was activity against

312
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,639
the bean Beetle and it was basically ask

313
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,159
acting as a repellent in that system in

314
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:01,519
the second we looked at toxicity and it

315
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,919
is toxic the fall army worm uh we looked

316
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,480
in both cases we looked at fungicidal

317
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,838
activity on a powdery mildew remembering

318
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,720
that these are different organisms and

319
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:15,240
powdering mildew was uh of

320
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,399
him the we had almost complete control

321
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,198
and that was equal to any biopesticide

322
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:26,360
that was on the market at the time and

323
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:30,078
in the um acorn squash powdery mildew we

324
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,199
had uh consistent with what we someone

325
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,599
would use with if they were using what

326
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:37,679
was available as the best powdery me do

327
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,680
control at that

328
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:44,399
time so in summary what I'm have been

329
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:47,439
saying is that we do have uh byproducts

330
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,318
from CBD extraction we can create a use

331
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,800
for these products using the

332
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:53,120
nanoemulsion

333
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,519
technology and it's active against some

334
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,480
insects and some pathogens it's not a

335
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:02,600
universal uh insecticide or a universal

336
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:06,199
Fung side but it we can do acceptable

337
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,318
applications uh we work very hard to get

338
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,000
uh con use concentrations that are not

339
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:14,558
phytotoxic if you know anything about

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,759
putting Tarpin on plants tpin are very

341
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,959
phytotoxic when you apply them to the

342
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,640
surface so we have to to work on

343
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,519
adjusting that but we've got those

344
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,720
levels at this point and we have a great

345
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:29,279
potential I think for a

346
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,480
biopesticide uh development from him uh

347
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,759
like Mike I'm looking I'm came looking

348
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:40,200
for potential collaborators and and uh

349
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:42,558
and money to take this uh technology

350
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,160
further

351
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,440
and at that point I just wanted to say

352
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,279
that this if we can develop this we can

353
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,919
use this product then we can close the

354
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,558
loop and make

355
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,759
cannabis one of the few crops that can

356
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:59,599
be

357
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,919
fully uh fulfill the go goals of the one

358
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,918
Health

359
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,349
[Applause]

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,839
initiatives thank you for this nice

361
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:19,038
presentation but I was a little bit

362
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:23,038
confused because we have

363
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:26,839
many uh Canabis cult Wars very rich

364
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:31,640
inprints very very very rich interin but

365
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:34,119
100% susceptible to we do but now we are

366
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:38,320
saying using the same Terin we can

367
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:40,839
control the poing me do how that works

368
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,359
we are we are working on I think your

369
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:46,279
question is can we just use the tpin and

370
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,959
do this now I'm saying we have the

371
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:51,519
plants that they are rich in tpin they

372
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,000
are know naturally producing the terpins

373
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,400
in a very high level but they are

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,279
completely susceptible to P me as an

375
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,880
example yes but

376
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,558
yes and we don't know why because when

377
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,120
we first did the the hemp experiment I

378
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,839
fully expected it the powdering mildew

379
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:13,918
to not have any response at all um but

380
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,678
it is I think uh kind of related to the

381
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,080
fact that we have the an nanom Motion in

382
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,559
there and that allows a different uh

383
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:25,079
uptake by the pathogen than if it's just

384
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:28,720
exposed to the the Turpin and the glands

385
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:32,720
in like the hemp so I think that it's a

386
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:37,440
it's a ma it's a matter of exposure and

387
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,440
how much is uptake by the fun by the

388
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:46,359
fungus thank you very much for I think

389
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,519
there's there was somebody over here did

390
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:51,199
you have a question yes I do okay thank

391
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:55,400
you very much for your

392
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,000
presentation Dr G um for your ferium

393
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,480
studies did you perform a concentration

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,119
dependence

395
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,120
uh study using the hemp

396
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:10,079
biopesticide we did not use a we did not

397
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,400
do a concentration study what we did is

398
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:15,678
we took the same amount that we knew was

399
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,360
not phytotoxic and the the same

400
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,880
concentration that we used on the

401
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,439
powdering mildew on the plants for

402
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,799
powdering mildew anything above that was

403
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,440
phytotoxic so we didn't we also didn't

404
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,279
see how low we could go but since since

405
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,960
we didn't get great resp responses with

406
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,279
the highest concentration that we felt

407
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,679
we could use we didn't pursue it any

408
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,599
further now we don't have that kind of

409
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,559
data for seeds and seed and the effects

410
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:45,079
on seed germination so we will be using

411
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:45,079
higher concentrations in those

412
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:53,480
studies I have a question over here

413
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:56,159
Excuse me yes here yeah oh hi hi

414
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,400
wonderful talk I have a ton of questions

415
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:03,120
and um focusing on the

416
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:06,559
application um methodologies where um H

417
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:10,199
are you or have you looked at uh with

418
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:14,158
regard to seed uh fumigant versus uh

419
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,558
seed coating or delivery to plants soil

420
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,960
drenching effects versus Leaf spraying

421
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:22,158
effects and influences on micro risal

422
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,600
and

423
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,080
beneficial we have not looked at at at

424
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:31,240
beneficials uh and we are in the first

425
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,158
stages of the seeds what we are finding

426
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,759
because of some of my other interest in

427
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:39,080
other bioactive products we've been

428
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:41,919
looking at hemp seed uh and fusarium and

429
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,918
we find that if we do a a surface

430
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,440
sterilization of seed we still have

431
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,480
fusarium so we are uh concerned about

432
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,640
that as a

433
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,079
transmission and excuse me and so we are

434
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,360
hoping that if we can soak them in this

435
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,278
with the Nano Emulsion and uh and it

436
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,119
won't be toxic to seed germination

437
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,278
because we don't know that at this point

438
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:08,278
that we can perhaps get some better

439
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:08,278
control of those internally transmitted

440
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:20,919
fungi hi um do these types of molecules

441
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,759
have any uh prior use in this

442
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:27,000
application and do the pests ever show

443
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:30,798
any kind of resistance or tolerance over

444
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,839
Generations um yes uh there is a body of

445
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,599
literature on essential oils and these

446
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,000
are common components of different

447
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,079
essential

448
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,440
oils particularly the caropine that's

449
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:46,119
been a uh standard uh test in a lot of

450
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,038
the uh for the a lot of the insects so

451
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:51,319
yes there there is literature saying

452
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:54,519
that this is an insecticidal property

453
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:56,200
this is a unique blend so as we've

454
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:58,000
talked about with human medicine there

455
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,480
is an Entourage effect with it with

456
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,079
pesticide sides as well so we we don't

457
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,519
know what this specific uh comp has done

458
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:08,038
this is the first testing of those but

459
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,639
some of these individually and also as

460
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:13,359
components us sometimes major components

461
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,000
of other essential oils have been done

462
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:19,519
um usually with essential oils we don't

463
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,319
see resistance developing because the

464
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,240
different essential oils have diff

465
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:26,038
different Tarpin have different modes of

466
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,038
action so these are all sesat tping so

467
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,558
that might be a little U more risk of

468
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,599
developing

469
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,038
uh resistance but the fact is when we

470
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,399
have these with these are really

471
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,119
terpenoids when we have these oxygens at

472
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,080
least with fungi we found that they're

473
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:45,158
more fungicidal typically with these

474
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,839
oxygens and so we don't know exactly

475
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,919
what the risk of resistance for this is

476
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:55,399
we have not done the experiment where we

477
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:57,240
go back and uh take the m and and make

478
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,559
them and go back and and start looking

479
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,200
at generation after gener generation

480
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:02,879
I've been doing this work on insects I'm

481
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,919
a plant pathologist so that was just

482
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,919
beyond what I wanted to

483
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,480
do it's hard to see out there I can't

484
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,480
see anybody all right
