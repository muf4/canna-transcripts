2
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,960
so I think to start it would be great if

3
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,600
you could tell us what inspired you to

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,480
undertake this study of cannabis and

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:30,039
focus on developing a gene expression

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:33,039
database okay um well I would say that

7
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,558
the recent changes in the regulation of

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:39,839
cannabis use and cultivation around the

9
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:42,640
world have opened up opportunities to

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,879
research with the species to be

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,320
condensed more broadly so this has lead

12
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:53,320
to a rap increase in the amount of

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,558
information available about

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,238
cannabis so including earna sequence

15
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,479
data and however these data are often in

16
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,518
the RO

17
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:08,920
form uh meaning that the while the ear

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,520
A6 sequence files are available in

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,799
public databases for example uh without

20
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:16,840
proper futuring and Analysis they aren't

21
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,960
very

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:24,879
affirmative so and addition to this um

23
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:29,399
not all of this um data are linked to

24
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:32,599
published scientific studies so this

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,399
this is where the idea of the Cannabis

26
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:38,839
expression Atlas came in uh the goal was

27
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:42,719
to create a database that translates the

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,320
earic data so it's speak um transforming

29
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:50,359
R sequence information into easy to use

30
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:53,118
and refined data to anyone interested

31
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:55,239
in great so you're you're you're

32
00:01:53,118 --> 00:02:00,039
Translating that data to make it more

33
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:02,199
useful yeah excellent um so one thing

34
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,320
noticed when I I was reading through the

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,159
the abstract in the paper is that you

36
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,679
chose to use the Jamaican lion reference

37
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,840
which again near and dear to our heart

38
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,318
at medicinal genomics uh our team is the

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,159
one who who put that together so how

40
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:20,479
does that reference benefit the

41
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,680
study um well um during my Nisha

42
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:27,399
research I realized that there was no

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,319
consensus about uh which reference

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,159
genome to use in cannabis research so

45
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:37,119
this made me want to look further

46
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,560
to available genomes for these species

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,039
to choose the most suitable one for

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,239
using our

49
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,679
study so I found that most of other

50
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,439
genomes came from female plants and were

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,120
from type one or three

52
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:58,959
chemotypes and that's mean that's when

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:03,239
the JAMA genome called my attention

54
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:07,000
because first it's a type two her so

55
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:11,360
which means that has the both gcas and

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,360
cbdas gen active and additionally both

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,480
male and female plants were sequenced

58
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,239
and the researchers from the medic

59
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:23,238
genomics had identified a Rion

60
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,920
corresponding to the Y

61
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,560
chromosome and this is uh a key feature

62
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,438
compared to other available genomes

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,318
because

64
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:37,079
which uh as I mentioned are all from

65
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:40,399
female plant so using this genome as

66
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,760
reference uh allow us to enrich our

67
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,280
database and identify Express terms for

68
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:50,519
why chromosomes and genes for example

69
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,680
and which can be very useful for helping

70
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:57,680
researchers to better understand sex

71
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,680
differentiation in canis for example

72
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:12,359
