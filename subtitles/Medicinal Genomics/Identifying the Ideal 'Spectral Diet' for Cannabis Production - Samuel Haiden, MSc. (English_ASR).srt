1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,419
hi I'm here to bring you guys back to

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,039
the world of cultivation my name is Sam

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,320
Hayden I work for the agricultural

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,178
biotechnology Lab at the University of

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,620
Connecticut

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,320
um I'd like to thank can Med for

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,439
inviting me and of course my Pi uh Dr

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,339
Gerald Berkowitz for funding me for this

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,339
wonderful Adventure

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,599
um so first I'd like to just go over a

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,260
little bit about what we do in the lab

12
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:34,200
our lab mostly deals with the regulation

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,359
of gene expression in cannabis and we

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,820
also study uh Gene

15
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,640
Gene function

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,378
um so what you're seeing here is some

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,780
work that we've done characterizing

18
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:49,259
transcription factors that induce

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,000
trichome morphogenesis in cannabis one

20
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,058
of these is a MIB transcription Factor

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,640
called mixta which is the focus of my

22
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:59,939
Master's thesis on the top left here

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,359
you're seeing a transient expression

24
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:06,179
study in the Oceana benthamana where we

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,700
showed the nuclear localization of this

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,860
protein

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,680
on the right you're seeing qpcr results

28
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:16,379
for the expression pattern of this Gene

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,700
over uh seven weeks of flowering and you

30
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,679
can see that it's peaking right about

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,500
the time the cannabinoid biosynthesis

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,020
tends to ramp up

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,420
and then um the bottom two photos you're

34
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:31,438
seeing are scanning electron micrographs

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,719
of trichomes of nicotiana tobacum leaves

36
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,578
and on the left you're seeing a wild

37
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,140
type Leaf

38
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,539
um with a normal distribution of

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,700
trichomes and normal branching in the

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,939
trichomes more importantly and then on

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,640
the right you're seeing a tobacco leaf

42
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:51,539
that is stably transformed and over

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,280
expressing this cannabis protein and

44
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,060
what you're seeing is a significantly

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,680
increased number of trichomes and also

46
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,740
increased trichome branching which I

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,439
think is the more important find there

48
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:07,859
um and so basically this is an example

49
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,959
of just what we do we we do expression

50
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,719
in heterologous systems to identify Gene

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,180
function and we use a lot of qpcr to

52
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,400
determine how these genes are regulated

53
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,219
how their expression is regulated and

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,080
what their expression patterns are we

55
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,000
are also interested in yeah enzymes

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,580
involved in cannabinoid biosynthesis

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,840
like Lauren Sands she's also from our

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,300
lab gave a presentation on pt4 so

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,219
interesting to note too is that all of

60
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,260
these genes are coordinated in this

61
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,000
wonderful Symphony

62
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,979
um and that you know cannabinoid

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,800
biosynthesis isn't actually just as

64
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,780
simple as the biosynthetic enzymes

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,300
because those enzymes themselves are

66
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,818
controlled by trichome genes which are

67
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,219
controlled by flowering genes so there's

68
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:56,280
really a complex system here and that's

69
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:59,098
more or less what we study

70
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,560
this here is made by Peter apicella he

71
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:03,959
was a student in our lab and he utilized

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,620
some of my data to create a correlation

73
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:11,280
Matrix which shows how this mixed Gene

74
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,560
it's labeled here as tfy is tightly

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,658
correlated with um

76
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,180
very important genes and cannabinoid

77
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:20,280
biosynthesis namely being adrenal

78
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,560
pyrophosphate synthase and Olive atolic

79
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,180
acid cyclase many of you here probably

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,878
know that those are the precursors for

81
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,920
cbga and we found the that the

82
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,479
expression of this mixed Gene was

83
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,339
actually tightly correlated with the

84
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,158
expression of those two genes which to

85
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,200
me was interesting because we've seen

86
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,299
from other research that cannabinoids

87
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,179
aren't really produced until the

88
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,439
trichome produces a stock so I'm

89
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,140
actually interested in seeing what

90
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,060
trichome genes are initiating the

91
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,098
development of the stock which may be

92
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,158
also thereby activating cannabinoid

93
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:54,798
biosynthesis genes but this is just a

94
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,899
good way to illustrate

95
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,140
the symphony again the of all of these

96
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,420
different enzymes and products that are

97
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:07,018
working in coordination to generate

98
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:10,139
these cannabinoids that we love so much

99
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,239
so moving on from what we do

100
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,818
um I'm going to talk about I'm going to

101
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,620
get into this spectral diet question I

102
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,918
mentioned genetic expression the

103
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,600
regulation of gene expression because

104
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,180
um what we're how we're looking at

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,300
spectral diet is a means of manipulating

106
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:32,100
gene expression in order to accomplish

107
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,918
crop steering outcomes so we hear this

108
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,680
buzzword a lot achieving full genetic

109
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,959
expression we want to achieve the full

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,699
expression of the genetic potential of

111
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,739
the plant people throw that term around

112
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,600
a lot and I don't think that they fully

113
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,800
understand what that means

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,960
um but we're going to get to the bottom

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,759
of it

116
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,258
so the way I look at it and the way many

117
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,939
people look at it is that you're

118
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,759
breeding in genotype selection is where

119
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,779
you determine the roof the potential to

120
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,479
you

121
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,939
can hope to live up to

122
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,399
um and in and the way to do that is by

123
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,978
removing limiting factors so limiting

124
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,978
factors being par nutrition uh

125
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:13,918
transpiration rates via VPD making sure

126
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:16,258
your CO2 levels are all adequate

127
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,879
um so theoretically by removing these

128
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,580
limiting factors we're allowing the

129
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,899
plant to achieve its fullest potential

130
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:25,198
foreign

131
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:27,179
and uh then after you've removed all of

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,620
these limiting factors what's next at

133
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,259
that point we're talking about crop

134
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,139
steering we're talking about actually

135
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,879
pushing that roof and increasing the

136
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,759
potential that we can hope to live up to

137
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,800
by modifying

138
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,439
um the way that the plant grows with

139
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,960
environmental signals and cues and a lot

140
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,439
of these cues uh deal with genetic

141
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,439
regulation

142
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,038
um so spectral diet is a method of crop

143
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,418
steering arroya defines this as being

144
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,978
the Strategic adjustment of the

145
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:57,680
environment to encourage plants to grow

146
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:01,379
in a specific pattern

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,840
so again we're we're trying to control

148
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,699
these growth patterns by controlling

149
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,519
gene expression because gene expression

150
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,740
is at the base of so much of this the

151
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,299
rapidity at which a flower starts to a

152
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,038
plant starts to flower is often

153
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,139
determined by the expression levels of

154
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,300
certain genes at certain times and how

155
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,918
they're regulated

156
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,360
um so one of the first examples I ever

157
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,599
saw of this was back in my medical

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,120
growing days when my gurus back then

159
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,539
would insist that we swap out every

160
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,579
other HPS with a CMH and this was really

161
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:34,860
common and It produced better flowers

162
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,240
nobody really knew why

163
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,759
um but we all presumed that it was

164
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,120
because of the wider spectral range that

165
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,639
you see in the metal halide spectrograph

166
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,740
there as opposed to HPS which is mostly

167
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,418
yellow

168
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,740
um and there wasn't really data behind

169
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:51,659
that people just did it because it

170
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,160
worked and I think that what we're

171
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,860
finding is there's actually maybe some

172
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,080
data to support that and then on the

173
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,199
left picture here you're seeing

174
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:04,318
um a greenhouse being supplementally lit

175
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,840
by red and far red LEDs this is a

176
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,539
strategy that's taken up by ornamental

177
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:13,019
Growers lots of Growers because red to

178
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:15,000
far red ratios affect the downstream

179
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:18,000
expression the expression of genes

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,959
Downstream of phytochrome which is

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,839
something I'm going to start talking

182
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,359
about in a moment but these strategies

183
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,818
have been taken up by other uh

184
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,520
Industries not only in terms of what

185
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,979
what spectral diet to give the plant at

186
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,939
a consistent rate but also ways that we

187
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:38,939
can give little shots of

188
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:40,978
um different wavelengths to elicit a

189
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:44,699
different response and this is a very

190
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:46,079
complex wide-reaching subject DLI photo

191
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,360
period fluency

192
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,359
Etc but what we're focused on in this

193
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,660
study reductive of course is blue to Red

194
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,180
ratios and red to far red ratios

195
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,460
and those ratios are known to affect two

196
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,120
signaling molecules in the plant known

197
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,739
as phytochrome and cryptochrome

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,360
um it turns out as it happens I think

199
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,460
that cryptochrome may actually be the

200
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,199
more important signaling molecule in

201
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:13,019
activating flowering

202
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,319
but uh we originally were pursuing red

203
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,060
far red ratios and phytochrome

204
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,160
phytochrome activity because it's very

205
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,680
well studied and because it has been

206
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,020
shown to be the origin of the shade

207
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,000
avoidance response if many of you have

208
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,740
heard of that I'm not sure but basically

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,538
the shade avoidance response is when the

210
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,060
plant registers that it's under shaded

211
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:35,399
light because of the increased ratio of

212
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,439
far red far red having a lower energy

213
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,620
and a longer wavelength is able to

214
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,080
penetrate deep into the canopy and red

215
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,940
light is not so the plant has evolved to

216
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,940
know that when it gets a lot of far red

217
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,160
that it's in the shade and so this

218
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,140
phytochrome molecule becomes inactivated

219
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,958
and that results in what's known as the

220
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,240
shade avoidance response where the stem

221
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,419
elongates and it attempts to escape that

222
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,860
poor light to get to the good light so

223
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,179
knowing that that was happening we

224
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,278
thought that this might be a good

225
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,439
candidate to Target for manipulation to

226
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,778
see if we can affect gene expression

227
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,180
also on the right you're seeing a

228
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:14,539
diagram of the current model for

229
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,639
flowering initiation and arabidopsis

230
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:19,439
which is a long day plant and that's

231
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,080
interesting to note because most of what

232
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,420
we know about these signaling Pathways

233
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,700
has been studied in arabidopsis which

234
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:29,039
has a different mechanism of flowering

235
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,339
than short day plants or cannabis right

236
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,740
and in general short day flowering is

237
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,459
much less well understood much less well

238
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:41,159
studied however

239
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:42,419
rice is a very good model species that

240
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,458
we can use to understand that because

241
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,199
it's also a short day plant and a model

242
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,599
species that has been heavily studied

243
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,620
and from that data from that literature

244
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,899
we know that Constance and ft are two

245
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,778
genes Downstream of both phytochrome and

246
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,399
cryptochrome which initiate flowering

247
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:00,600
and

248
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,839
um

249
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,540
and those two genes we we've actually

250
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,180
gone ahead and studied those in uh in in

251
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,679
in further studies but basically the

252
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:13,379
point is that these two genes although

253
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,778
they're present in uh short day plants

254
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,919
like Arab sorry like cannabis or rice

255
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:20,879
they have a slightly different signaling

256
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,458
methodology a different a different

257
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,019
signaling pathway and

258
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,879
um I think that creates a lot of good

259
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,500
opportunities for research because in

260
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,299
studying cannabis flowering we can learn

261
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,839
more about how short day plants flower

262
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,838
in general

263
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,779
um so why are we doing this hasn't this

264
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,278
already been done didn't Bruce bugbee

265
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:41,039
already cover all of this

266
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,659
uh it's a good question what have so the

267
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,699
question I have to ask myself is why

268
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:46,740
bother what what have previous studies

269
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,600
lacked and I think this is actually kind

270
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,419
of glaring like a big problem because

271
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,159
I've noticed that um most studies done

272
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,278
on light wavelengths are done using

273
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:58,919
different fixtures we're comparing HPS

274
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:01,320
to metal halide to different LED arrays

275
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,899
and generally there's a lot of variables

276
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,200
we're not just testing one variable

277
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,659
these these spectral diets vary in many

278
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,879
many different ways for instance this is

279
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:15,240
an example of a popular study which made

280
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,799
the conclusion that Inc sorry I say this

281
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,278
the three graphs you see at the bottom

282
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,319
are referring are a study that was done

283
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:23,838
which implied that the increasing blue

284
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,720
Photon fraction

285
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,339
decreases yields and um but if you take

286
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,259
a look at these graphs you'll see that

287
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:33,839
from left to right the blue Photon

288
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:36,659
fraction increases but the red Photon

289
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,860
fraction actually decreases so I'm

290
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,559
wondering how we're able to make

291
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,259
conclusions absolutely about blue Photon

292
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,419
fraction when there are other variables

293
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,419
that are also changing which have a

294
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:51,019
synergistic effect so I'm not confident

295
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,278
in these data I'm not confident that

296
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:54,600
decreasing blue Photon or increasing

297
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,240
blue Photon fraction will decrease

298
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,519
yields because we for instance we didn't

299
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,700
keep the red light constant in this case

300
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,700
the red light decreases and so the blue

301
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,278
to Red ratio is actually decreasing in

302
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,899
each of these so theoretically if you

303
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,000
wanted to you could possibly say that

304
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:16,200
the decreasing blue to Red ratio is

305
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,600
what's causing these yields yield losses

306
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,100
um I want to shout out to Adaptive so

307
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,139
the way we're getting around this is

308
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,778
that adaptive growth Technologies has

309
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:28,259
donated these lights to us which enable

310
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:30,360
us to use the exact same fixture with

311
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,879
different diode with the with the same

312
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,980
diode arrays but then to either turn on

313
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,259
or off different diodes in those lights

314
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,039
so we can control all of the different

315
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,838
spectral ratios except for one and so

316
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,199
that's what I think that's the advantage

317
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,880
we have at abl over other labs that are

318
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,778
trying to do this

319
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,600
um

320
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:54,480
so it's ironic that I say that because I

321
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,339
handed this off to a student who

322
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,200
um was going to pick up the project and

323
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,680
didn't and I asked them to set this up

324
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,259
to study high red ratios versus low red

325
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,419
ratios and they did that Unfortunately

326
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:08,578
they did not control for the blue to Red

327
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,199
ratio which was exactly the issue we've

328
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:12,899
been talking about so you can see here

329
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,778
there's a low in T1 the top figure

330
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,639
there's a there's a low red to far red

331
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,539
ratio meaning there's a lot of far red

332
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,879
light

333
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:21,980
but there's also a high blue to Red

334
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,600
ratio

335
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,278
and I'm almost happy he did this it was

336
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,980
a mistake but it ended up showing us

337
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:31,259
something that's worth knowing

338
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,259
um so because basically there's two

339
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,720
variables low red to far red high blue

340
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:38,578
to Red in the top figure compared to the

341
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
bottom and the results of this were

342
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:41,879
interesting they were very exciting

343
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,040
because we actually saw a pretty

344
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,500
significant increase in flower biomass

345
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:49,199
the leaf surface area is a phenotypic

346
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,899
change which is maybe not as important

347
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,500
but a significant and large increase in

348
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:57,059
flower biomass was was the result of

349
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,100
this treatment

350
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,958
and so the question becomes which of the

351
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,600
two variables is responsible for this

352
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,159
change is it the low red to far red

353
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,839
which is the opposite of what we

354
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,299
expected we thought that the low red to

355
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,820
far red would decrease yields

356
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,319
um or is it the blue to red and so that

357
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,660
is what we need to study now and that's

358
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,459
what we've continued to do so this is a

359
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,559
new experiment where I picked this up

360
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:23,638
and I controlled for the blue to Red

361
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:25,439
ratio and I manipulated only the red to

362
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,639
far red ratios

363
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,279
um because those are the two that we

364
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,278
consider to be biologically significant

365
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:34,980
and the result of this was

366
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:37,559
absolutely no change sorry for the

367
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,180
letdown not very exciting but basically

368
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,819
what we found is that red to far red

369
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:44,879
ratios are having no considerable impact

370
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,980
on yield but that also leads us to some

371
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,078
other interesting conclusions

372
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,759
so

373
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,159
um what we did also do is we studied the

374
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,899
cannabinoids and we found that this is

375
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:58,740
fresh flowers so all that was present

376
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:01,440
was the cbga thca and cbda we found no

377
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,299
change in cbda however by week six in

378
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,279
the high red to far red treatment we

379
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,740
actually saw a statistically significant

380
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,480
increase in cbga

381
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,579
um that's interesting because it

382
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,278
indicates there might be some gene

383
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,019
expression effect but it's also

384
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,419
interesting because we see that although

385
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:21,060
there's an increase in cbga there's no

386
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:23,578
increase in cbda we are concerned with

387
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:26,759
what's the rate limiting step in

388
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:28,739
cannabinoid biosynthesis and this kind

389
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,000
of gives us some information to chew on

390
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,000
to think about that

391
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,860
and again this is the same data but this

392
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,360
is on the composite dry flower so

393
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,220
instead of with the fresh flower we just

394
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,259
took the terminal flower with this

395
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,300
composite measurement we took each plant

396
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,278
dried and milled the whole plant

397
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:50,338
together and measured that composite

398
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,078
sample and we still find that there's

399
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,899
actually an even greater increase in

400
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:57,000
cbga in the composite sample

401
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,519
um however no change in anything else so

402
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,958
overall not that exciting but there's

403
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,440
more

404
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:07,559
so um I mentioned these genes that are

405
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,480
flowering genes that are Downstream of

406
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,099
cryptochrome and phytochrome and these

407
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,320
are also very interesting targets for

408
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,120
breeding and for potential biotechnology

409
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,000
technological work

410
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,799
um because these genes are what signal

411
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,379
the plant to start flowering

412
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,359
and this was interesting because in like

413
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,639
I said we are trying to manipulate gene

414
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,079
expression using spectrums

415
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,698
um not only to understand how to better

416
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,519
cultivate the plant but potentially to

417
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,319
better understand how the gene functions

418
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,940
or sorry how the plant functions and

419
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,639
what genes are doing and how they're

420
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,480
activating these flowering Cascades and

421
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,899
so interestingly enough we found that

422
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,039
Constance and ft expression were changed

423
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:48,440
significantly from the from this light

424
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,759
treatment

425
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,279
but more importantly this is the first

426
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,419
time that anybody's actually character

427
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,820
characterized the expression patterns of

428
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:59,039
these genes in cannabis so I'm pretty

429
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,379
excited to say that the expression

430
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,958
patterns of these genes so far line up

431
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:05,818
quite well with the rice model and so I

432
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,279
feel like we could actually use the rice

433
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:10,318
model to try and understand

434
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,259
um how to which which genes are actually

435
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,818
important for flowering in cannabis and

436
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:17,099
this is evidence to suggest that that

437
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:20,159
would actually be a good comparison

438
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,438
uh foragen is a critical night length

439
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,900
gated uh Gene and you can see that

440
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,459
before flowering at Day Zero uh its

441
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,740
expression was basically nothing and

442
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,600
then it increases to six thousand and

443
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,359
twelve thousand fold in the first week

444
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,219
of flowers so that indicates that

445
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,639
that these genes are probably important

446
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,319
however I will say that the sad thing is

447
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,759
that we although we saw the change in

448
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,099
expression of these genes we saw no

449
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,900
change in yield so

450
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:48,119
um in terms of commercial value maybe

451
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,160
we're not there yet but

452
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,719
um I think it's interesting to note that

453
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,720
although these genes expression were

454
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,660
changed they had no effect on yield

455
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,620
and so um coming to the end of the talk

456
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,419
here

457
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,399
um this is what we're doing right now as

458
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:05,880
we speak and I think that this will be

459
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,380
our our our best experiment because

460
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,360
um in the first experiment we had two

461
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,700
variables uh in the in the same

462
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,639
experiment in the second experiment we

463
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,200
had we reduced that to one variable and

464
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,140
in this experiment we're testing the

465
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,519
other variable and we saw an effect in

466
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,840
the first one no effect in the second

467
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,700
one I expect we'll see some change here

468
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,558
in contrast to the other study that I

469
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,080
mentioned I believe that in this case

470
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,940
the increasing blue Photon fraction will

471
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,439
actually increase yields and the reason

472
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,140
for that is that we've kept the red

473
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,240
constant so what we're looking at rather

474
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,340
than the total fluence at any different

475
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,160
wavelength we're actually looking at the

476
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,538
ratio of one wavelength to another which

477
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,759
I think is the more biologically

478
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:49,079
significant

479
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,700
factor to look at

480
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,579
um so I'm really excited about this I

481
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,580
think it's going to turn out great and

482
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:58,798
um this is I don't know and this is just

483
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,538
a photo of that happening right now in

484
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,700
our grow tents you can see on the right

485
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:04,859
you've got a much Bluer sort of looking

486
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,660
spectrum and on the left you've got this

487
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,819
white red it looks a little bit more

488
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,919
like what an HPS would

489
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:12,418
um because that's actually more similar

490
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,038
to what an HPS Spectrum actually looks

491
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:17,160
like

492
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:19,259
um so yeah in conclusion uh red to far

493
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,740
red seem to have no effect except for

494
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:24,240
increasing cbga which is interesting

495
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,759
um and although the expression of

496
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,538
constance and ft were changed it had no

497
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:32,279
impact on yield whatsoever however ft

498
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,319
and Constance have very similar

499
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,558
expression patterns in cannabis as they

500
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,720
do in rice so that's exciting and also

501
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:42,599
we believe that the increasing blue to
