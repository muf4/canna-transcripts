1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,669
hello someone once told me that the best

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,160
pitches comes from heart

3
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:16,199
unfortunately my heart speaks Hebrew so

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,629
it's gonna be a bit of a struggle but

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,710
we're all in this together and I think

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:25,948
we'll make it my name is Amir : I'm from

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,480
Israel 26 years old and a third year

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,410
medical student at the Hebrew University

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,850
in Jerusalem I've come here today to

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,320
present you a brief account of my

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,320
personal connection with medical

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,109
cannabis in terms of both my future

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,280
status as a medical team member as well

14
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:46,409
as my currently status is patient

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,590
treated within Israel cannabis medical

16
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:51,808
program at the age of 20 about 6 years

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,420
ago and in the middle of my military

18
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,939
service I began feeling ill I lost

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,289
weight had abdominal pains and a

20
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,349
decreased ability of properly

21
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,349
functioning in view of rather typical

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,909
military service further personal

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,030
complaints were delayed for several

24
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,819
months until it became clear that indeed

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,129
something was seriously wrong so they

26
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,408
sent me to some laboratory testing staff

27
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:19,379
and following the series laboratory

28
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,600
tests and colonoscopy I was fine I was

29
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,868
informed about the diagnosis Crohn's

30
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,509
disease IBD and so medical treatment

31
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:31,129
consisting of steroids was initiated at

32
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,810
once and after a two-week period of

33
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:38,149
steroid treatment which wasn't effective

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:41,640
at all my doctors put me on an tighten

35
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:45,478
also called Remicade and following

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,689
several sessions of on this drug it was

37
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:51,149
seemingly a slight improvement but the

38
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:53,250
ball Tory tests results as well as my

39
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,269
general well-being was it wasn't perfect

40
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,549
maybe 80% of something like that at this

41
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:01,078
time my grandfather professor Ralph Alma

42
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,990
shulam who I'm sure some of you have

43
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,750
heard about and was personally engaged

44
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,269
and actively participated in study

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,269
concerning Crohn's disease and medical

46
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:14,909
cannabis so after a discussion between

47
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:15,430
my doctor my grandfather and myself we

48
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:18,818
have this

49
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,760
adding medical cannabis to my biological

50
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:23,979
treatment regime the cannabis train

51
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,348
which I'm treated with contains a

52
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:28,959
relatively small amount of THC and a

53
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:31,899
high content of CBD the ratio is about

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,968
four to one something like that and

55
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,819
which on the basis of earlier data was

56
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:41,829
found to have some anti-inflammatory

57
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:43,780
effect so right now I'm feeling fine

58
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:46,420
this treatment regime among whom I now

59
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,239
to more than continue continues four

60
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:51,908
years of remission both clinically and

61
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,829
also laboratory and others in some minor

62
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:56,348
scarring at the terminal Illium as a

63
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:59,169
testimony of prior information I am in a

64
00:02:56,348 --> 00:03:02,668
completely normal non clinical state of

65
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:04,930
any of both the pathological signs and

66
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:13,659
silent symptoms which I previously

67
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:17,408
suffered from thank you beside being a

68
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:19,628
medical student and patient I'm also a

69
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:22,149
research assistant at the Hebrew

70
00:03:19,628 --> 00:03:24,908
University cannabinoid Research Centre

71
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,799
I'm I mainly focus on liver cirrhosis

72
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:30,668
but this is not for today for another

73
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,159
time so in a way cannabis plays an

74
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,729
important role in both my personal life

75
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,739
my work and my studying and I think that

76
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,620
puts me in a rather unique position in

77
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,959
which I can see a little bit of every

78
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,479
aspect of the Israeli medical cannabis

79
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,250
program and today I'm very fortunate of

80
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,400
being here with you and discussing a

81
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,539
number of related issue and the first

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,669
thing I want to talk about is the

83
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:57,789
medical cannabis program and most

84
00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:00,400
certain that dr. door presentation gave

85
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:03,098
you more than enough so I'm intending

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,269
intend to limit myself to just a few

87
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:09,578
topics from my point of view the first

88
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,889
thing is that is the research that

89
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:13,989
Israel consists such a pioneering

90
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,569
nations and many fold the aspect of

91
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,370
medical cannabis regarding from the

92
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:22,240
discovery of the endocannabinoid system

93
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:24,788
itself to the recent research regarding

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,939
epilepsy as dr. door said and much much

95
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:28,729
more and

96
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:31,610
I think that the advanced research

97
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,670
enables a relatively quick approval of

98
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,259
new indications for the patient and the

99
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,379
connection between the scientific

100
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:42,699
community and regulatory body is very

101
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:45,860
tight and beneficial for the patients

102
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:49,810
the other thing is the governmental

103
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,759
control and especially the thing that

104
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,910
the program in Israel is right now a

105
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,579
non-profit the payment is fixed you pay

106
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,550
about $100 a month regardless of the

107
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:03,889
amount you're prescribed to I am

108
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,800
entitled training runs a month which is

109
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:09,259
I think the minimal amount as most IBD

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,949
patients receive the cannabis for the

111
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:14,779
inflammation and not the pain and I pay

112
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:16,879
as much as someone who's getting the

113
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:19,669
hungry gram and the reason is that the

114
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,550
payment is limited for merely covering

115
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,110
expenditures associated with matters of

116
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,430
growth cultivation shipment and supply

117
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,889
and I think that the government of

118
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,819
financial support together with the not

119
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:37,339
so small number of commercial companies

120
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:39,349
involving in supplying them the drug and

121
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:43,250
it leads to an affordable high quality

122
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:45,590
drug product level in terms of a

123
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,480
relatively negative aspects there are

124
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:49,159
also a number of issues and among them

125
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,950
the particular issue of restrictive

126
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,840
regulation like dr. door said all

127
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,639
prescriptions have to be reviewed and

128
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,979
confirmed by a medical committee at the

129
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,139
Ministry of Health in your initial

130
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,780
applications as well as any subsequent

131
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:05,509
prescriptions renewal requests and over

132
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,659
the years the license the number of such

133
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,399
applications has rapidly increased and

134
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,410
it's been a struggle for for the

135
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:18,379
Minister of Health to keep up with the

136
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:20,870
pace and so it may cause delays in

137
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:23,449
renewal and cause problems to some of

138
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:27,680
the patients and this is the problem of

139
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:29,659
centralized medicine and furthermore in

140
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,790
such a most relevant topic is that in

141
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,240
Israel like here in the States cannabis

142
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,039
is regarded as a class 1 drug a thing

143
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,470
that puts a lot of restrictions on both

144
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:43,399
the patients and researchers on

145
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,710
this film now I would like to devote a

146
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,709
few sentences as to medical cannabis

147
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:50,839
related issues and its contents within

148
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:56,689
the study program at our medical school

149
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:58,969
in Jerusalem the sprout recent years our

150
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:01,639
style program included several hours

151
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,730
about cannabis especially in our

152
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,759
pharmacology course primarily in terms

153
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,990
of its potential and elective properties

154
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,120
furthermore particular emphasis was

155
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,430
placed on the investigation concerning

156
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,600
the involvement of the endocannabinoid

157
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:21,949
system and its therapeutic applicability

158
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,020
in cases of chronic pain instead of

159
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,519
alternatively in combination with the

160
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:27,349
opioid treatment which is a very

161
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,899
high-profile research nowadays I don't

162
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,629
need to tell you that this likewise

163
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,779
included some clinical presentation with

164
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,000
patients that came to to class to a

165
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:40,039
lecture hall bigger than that to tell

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,990
all of us about their treatment regime

167
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,840
and then they told us that some of them

168
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,030
are treated with opioids some with

169
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,539
opioids and cannabis which allow them to

170
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,219
reduce significant significantly

171
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,860
significantly the number of opioids

172
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,960
being taken and some can manage the pain

173
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,379
with cannabis alone which I think that's

174
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,379
remarkable

175
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:04,399
so based on all of those presentations

176
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,500
and classes it became clearly evident

177
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,889
that medical cannabis does not represent

178
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,740
a magical drug but rather an effective

179
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,659
therapeutic mean of reducing pain among

180
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,090
others in things of course

181
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,189
and although requiring further

182
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:21,859
scientific investigation and research

183
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:25,129
towards showing its full spectrum and

184
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,470
pharmacological profile it ought to be

185
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,759
noted that in the course of those

186
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,910
clinical presentations

187
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:35,479
it appeared that some of the attending

188
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,849
physicians it was a considerable

189
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:41,570
variability as to their knowledge in

190
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,430
this specific area and I myself am fully

191
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,060
confident that any future medical

192
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:48,839
generations in Israel

193
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:52,619
at least we'll be better equipped to the

194
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:55,290
knowing like having the required

195
00:08:52,620 --> 00:09:00,690
profound and basic scientific knowledge

196
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:03,689
about cannabis so at the end what indeed

197
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,000
can be expected in the future it is my

198
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,280
opinion that for most among the most

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,590
relevant topic and appointing the

200
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,579
prevailing therapeutic and even

201
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:16,950
commercial aspects of this field is that

202
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:21,150
still we need a lot of more a lot of

203
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:23,750
research especially the thing that I

204
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:27,990
think is most important in recent future

205
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:30,000
regarding research is that effective

206
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,539
treatment which means strain to

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,389
indication and route of administration

208
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:39,240
which it presently is primarily based on

209
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:42,330
inhibitory or smoking or vaping route

210
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,389
and thereby raising possible health

211
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:48,180
health risks and damages the second

212
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:51,090
thing is an additional highly relevant

213
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:53,309
topic is education medical education in

214
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,139
Israel the recognition as to the

215
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:58,619
applicable respective importance and

216
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:01,379
relevance has already begun and thus

217
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,019
through the overall issue of medical

218
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:06,659
cannabis usage and medical needs are

219
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:09,870
presently dealt in ever-increasing rate

220
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:12,209
and accordingly I think that a properly

221
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,700
trained an informed physician in this

222
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:17,730
particular area will undoubtably

223
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,100
be better equipped to offering the most

224
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,610
relevant treatment for his or her

225
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,680
patients so I think that if you're going

226
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,050
to invest in something in the near

227
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,689
future it should be medical education

228
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:33,719
and effective safe route of

229
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:36,630
administration and I want to thank you

230
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,440
all for listening to my story today have

231
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,439
a nice day thank you

232
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:47,198
you
