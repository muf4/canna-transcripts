2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,960
talking about scalping rates what is

3
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:22,439
that in well what is that right sculping

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,240
is a term used in the beverage industry

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,439
for a long time it is it describes the

6
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:30,479
process of active ingredients in the

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,119
beverages attaching

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,480
to the packaging because the packaging

9
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:39,558
material could be hydrophobic right it

10
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:42,398
lacks oil so when you have a oil like uh

11
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,238
ingredients it may stuck to the liner

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,640
right and then lose its potency in the

13
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,119
liquid so that that process cost go okay

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,239
well that's a good segue because we're

15
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,519
going to talk about packaging next so

16
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,198
yeah so maybe talk about some of the

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,760
different liner types that are available

18
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,479
and how they can sort of affect that

19
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:02,280
those scalping rates great um funny

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,118
enough I just published a article last

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,719
Friday talking about ciner types and uh

22
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:14,158
yeah the ciner is kind of a a big issue

23
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:16,759
for the whole industry um and we have

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
six years ago in California nobody's

25
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,478
using can everybody's using glass

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,240
because all the infusion technology are

27
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:26,599
not stable in a can and I think this is

28
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:29,118
the first issue verosa have helped comp

29
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:32,798
the industry solved um we we were

30
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:35,399
working with B PPG all the Big King

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,560
companies and ler companies we test all

32
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,759
their generations of liners and we

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,719
summarize okay and we improve our

34
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,239
formula we summarize okay what formula

35
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:49,519
Works in what liner and so today I think

36
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,158
we can confidently make a 12 months

37
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,000
stable beverages with a good emotion in

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,880
a good liner a good combination but at

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,159
the same time when the H beverages

40
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:04,239
brands are uh going to the market in the

41
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,280
very uh fast speed right they they get

42
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,118
what they can get right which is

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,759
understandable as a market um but

44
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,878
sometimes that leads to a NE lack of the

45
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:18,000
quality of the liners so we have seen

46
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:21,639
issues that clients U picked the wrong

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,400
liners and the wrong liners will lead to

48
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:28,399
much higher pocy scoping right um and

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,439
those are the continuous issues verosa

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,360
is is wanting to educate our

51
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:36,598
CL great so now did I hear correctly

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,000
that this isn't so much an issue with

53
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:43,919
glass yes you're right and so what are

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,360
some of the advantages of using cans

55
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,598
versus glass I mean if you don't have

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,280
the issue with glass why don't we see

57
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:52,679
more Brands using glass right I think

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,800
it's the um the heaviness of the

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,480
logistic shipping and the recyclability

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,360
right and uh I think those are the two

61
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,719
un

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,040
cost great okay so in addition to

63
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,318
scalping one of the other things that

64
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:12,598
you mentioned was um oxin oxygen Ingress

65
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:15,238
and kind of leading to that oxidation so

66
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,959
how how is that a factor interesting

67
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,080
yeah so like I said oxygen is kind of

68
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,439
the big enemy for cannabis

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,879
beverages actually

70
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:29,318
um I I advocate for our industry to use

71
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,280
beer as a benchmark because when you

72
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:32,158
make a beer

73
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,239
if you have high oxygen the flavor will

74
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,759
change dramatically right in a very

75
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,840
short time um so beer industry has

76
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,798
perfected their practice on lower the do

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,200
dissolve oxygen during the production

78
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,239
right so uh that's why what we Advocate

79
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:51,280
our co-packer of the canas beverage to

80
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,360
follow the practice of beer so imagine

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,360
you have a um packaging that has low

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,560
oxygen to start with right but if the

83
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,560
packaging somehow allows oxygen to come

84
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,479
in

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,199
from its seal or from the the body or

86
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,679
from anywhere then it doesn't matter you

87
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,000
have a low do to start dissolve oxygen

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,719
will continue to climb up and then the

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,040
aoid will be continuously to be uh

90
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:19,680
oxidized right so that's where we we we

91
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,919
see this potential issue especially from

92
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,079
pet bottles because pet the whole bottle

93
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:29,839
will allow oxygen com in constantly but

94
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,800
not only P some glass bottles with u you

95
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:37,599
know Chell resistant cap right or even

96
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,840
some k u with a a special lits right May

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,439
potentially Ingress oxygen so we are

98
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,758
having some research collaboration with

99
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:50,160
a lab right now uh to to further look

100
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,280
into this this is um this seems to be a

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,080
easy concept to understand but actually

102
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,119
it's very complex to test because you

103
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,839
have to remove the oxygen you have to

104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,360
control the environment so it's the this

105
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,959
is a nearly a year process right now

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,960
with the with our testing Partners so

107
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,959
stay tuned for this data

108
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:23,949
