2
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,838
how do you think Gene editing will shape

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,838
the future of the Cannabis

4
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:23,480
industry

5
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,359
um I I think I think and I'm GNA

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,760
probably use these both hand inand

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,359
whether it's Gene editing or whether

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,239
it's genetically modifying something um

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,320
again I think we can get to end end

10
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:38,000
points quicker um I think we can start

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,159
thinking out of the box as far as what

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,558
we might be able to do with the cannabis

13
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,199
plant like I said you know for 80 years

14
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,198
we haven't done any research really or

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,120
not not much research I shouldn't say

16
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,679
any

17
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,718
because breeding breeding cannabis for

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,920
THC was remarkable right we've got

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,879
plants that are 30 plus THC plants and

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,439
that's all through through breeding and

21
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,479
and trial andur and stuff um but

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,320
thinking about

23
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,200
what the plant may not may not do on its

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,799
own very well I'm thinking about some of

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,680
the rare canabo that a lot of the you

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,000
know I saw last year at canm people were

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,560
interested in

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,879
CBG

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,600
CBC some of the thcv or CBD vs you know

30
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,478
things that the plant doesn't make very

31
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,280
much of we might be able to breed that

32
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:27,118
might be able to you know through many

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,478
years and many iterations of breeding

34
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,640
get to that point but I think with all

35
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,679
the information we have um with the Pang

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,560
genome out there now we can really

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,640
narrow down on how to make a plant

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,560
that's got you know uh 15 to 20% CBC

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,280
which you know we don't have something

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,879
like that now I think uh uh

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,718
pharmaceutical companies would be really

42
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,640
interested to see you know what that

43
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:56,000
could do um make a plant that's disease

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,560
resistance has disease resistance PM is

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,680
is is out there hopl and vroid is out

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,719
there you know are there there ways we

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,560
can quickly try to uh change the plant

48
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,919
so that it's so it's doing something it

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,000
wouldn't normally do uh on its own um

50
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,439
and then not to speak of all the other

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,919
all the other things I think um that are

52
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,560
outside the medical world right uh right

53
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,919
the industrial hemp I think is gaining

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,239
huge Steam and I it's it's all a matter

55
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,159
of time before we're growing hemp just

56
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,920
like we're growing uh corn and soybeans

57
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,239
I think excellent yeah and so you

58
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,878
mentioned the service that you offer

59
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,959
there at the University of Wisconsin

60
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,679
where you will'll actually do sort of

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,719
Gene editing um for companies or

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,439
researchers or things like that so I

63
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:46,239
mean if you can divulge what sort of

64
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:49,400
traits are they interested in in uh

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,239
creating yeah um so so we do we do work

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,920
for other people but we also have some

67
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,519
internal work going on as well and

68
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,559
that's what I'll I'll be presenting at

69
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:01,158
at canmed this year um but I hear a lot

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,878
of people uh like what I just said are

71
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:05,679
interested in a lot of the rares um or

72
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:08,039
something that you know the the plant

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,959
just doesn't produce very much of um

74
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,120
I've heard can flavens talked about

75
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,439
quite a bit you know can flaven a and b

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,480
plant makes just a just a little bit of

77
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:20,639
it but they've been implicated at a lot

78
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:24,079
of different you know potentially cancer

79
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,759
cancer research um all kinds of stuff um

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,120
and a lot of their rares as well you

81
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,560
know inflammation I hear a lot of that

82
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,640
for CBC CBG

83
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:39,519
um and then uh other interests might be

84
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:42,598
uh nutrition uh you know seeds hemp

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,360
seeds can can we uh make them even more

86
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,158
nutritious than they are can we add

87
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,720
certain amino acids that may not be

88
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:54,959
there for chickens for instance um and

89
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,959
then you know Industrial Hemp again uh

90
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,360
can can we can we make uh you know the

91
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,759
hemp plant uh sequester heavy Metals

92
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,360
more than it does because we know it

93
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:08,158
does somewhat can we make it even better

94
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,159
um capturing carbon H has a wonderful

95
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:14,239
you know it's a it's a wonderful

96
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:17,238
sustainable plant and it's got a huge

97
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:22,160
root mass um and I think it's be a great

98
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:22,159
Target for capturing carbon wow

99
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:35,880
[Music]

100
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,879
