1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
good

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,039
uh thanks for having me so as a child

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,719
neurologist

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,638
it makes sense that we don't really come

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,359
into this profession with much

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,118
uh information or knowledge on cannabis

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,800
it's not part of our normal curriculum

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,719
certainly not taught in medical school

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
uh nor through residency

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,799
so where where do we learn this and it's

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,400
very simple as a pediatric neurologist

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,400
everything we learn that's decent

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,079
usually comes from the moms that we see

14
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,079
so any any of the good ideas that i've

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,280
really come across uh have typically

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
come from moms

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,600
i've seen some dads who've had ideas

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,320
also

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,558
i know and i'll leave it at that um

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,679
i'm a i'm a dad so i can i can get away

21
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,799
with that so

22
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,558
the the uh so my first experience here

23
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,439
really came from a mom who

24
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,039
was absolutely brilliant who came to me

25
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,839
with her son with autism who's

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,520
experiencing

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,160
uh significant challenges with

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,399
aggression so he was

29
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,558
at that time he uh he was coming to me

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,560
with reports from school he was

31
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,759
uh he was roughly eight years old at

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,879
that time but he was coming to me with

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,560
reports from school saying that they

34
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,959
were making no progress

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,118
he was having somewhere between 50 to

36
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,759
300 aggression aggressive episodes per

37
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,280
day

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,519
those would include things like biting

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,478
kicking trying to run out of the

40
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,200
classroom

41
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,560
the teachers had to wear taekwondo pads

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
just to protect themselves from the

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
biting

44
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,879
and his plan his individualized

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,439
education plan

46
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,798
was not be able to be followed it was

47
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,239
something that

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,799
he simply could not uh you know meet any

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,158
of the

50
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,079
goals that were being set for him

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,000
because the aggression overshadowed

52
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,919
everything else that was happening so we

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,959
talked about the standard approaches so

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,719
at that time it was a relatively uh

55
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,798
recent article from the new england

56
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,959
journal showing benefit for

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,399
respond for aggressive behaviors and

58
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,959
autism

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,478
the mom knew the article inside out she

60
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,559
she had read it and she'd reviewed it

61
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,718
and she had her own criticisms

62
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,519
which were quite good i have to say so

63
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:08,560
one of them was that it only enrolled of

64
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,719
49 children in the treatment arm and it

65
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,680
only followed them over eight weeks

66
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,318
and there really hadn't been and there

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
still aren't

68
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,000
very good long-term data for this this

69
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
issue

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
of aggression and autism is something

71
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,200
that is is a major epidemic

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,199
now we're seeing um when when you think

73
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,958
of when the autism epidemic hit

74
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,359
uh it was something that really picked

75
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,000
up 15 to 20 years ago

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,680
now we're seeing 15 to 20 year olds and

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
through adolescence we're seeing that

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,480
the

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
issues in autism do change over time so

80
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,759
the the young children

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,519
that we're seeing many times through

82
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,318
adolescents start to develop

83
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,759
increased aggressive behaviors this is

84
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,238
more commonly seen in boys

85
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,518
but we do see it in girls as well and a

86
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,719
lot of the boys who i've seen with this

87
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,719
had a history of of

88
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,159
regression autistic regression when

89
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,158
they're about two years old

90
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,199
many of them have history of epilepsy as

91
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,000
well

92
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,639
and when you look at what this does to

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,039
families

94
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,318
to the individual to the schools it's

95
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,719
it's a major challenge

96
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,238
it's not a minor thing at all and so

97
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,359
what happens with a lot of the kids

98
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,759
because i've seen many of these kids

99
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
who've

100
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,759
come from a background where they were

101
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,360
put on antipsychotics is the most common

102
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,479
side effect that you may know is weight

103
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,040
gain

104
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,079
so i can think of another patient that

105
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,840
came to me

106
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,159
who was at that time about 15

107
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,840
and he had gone up on through the use of

108
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,199
antipsychotics he had gone from about

109
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,080
150 pounds to

110
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,598
close to 300 pounds so now now he was

111
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,200
not only aggressive but he was

112
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,439
he could have actually played in the nfl

113
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,798
speaking he might that might be um

114
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,799
he could have been an offensive tackle

115
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,480
himself not only was he aggressive he

116
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,319
was a 300 pound aggressive

117
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,039
kid he was about six foot four 300

118
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,878
pounds non-verbal

119
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,400
he's but he's like my lovable grizzly

120
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,840
bear though he's a little like a grizzly

121
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,200
bear he he'll give you a hug

122
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
he's the sweetest kid he's got the

123
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,359
greatest heart but the aggressions of

124
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,000
course when you're 300 pounds and most

125
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
of the workers

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,719
in many of the schools that treat and

127
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,040
deal with children with autism

128
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,719
many times you see mostly women at those

129
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,560
schools and not many of men not many of

130
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,759
whom are six for 300 pounds to match

131
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,878
this guy

132
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,000
so it's frightening a lot of the moms so

133
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,079
that patient's mother

134
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
happened to weigh about 100 pounds uh

135
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,799
and when he became aggressive he would

136
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,759
hit her

137
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,319
violently uh in the head um i have other

138
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,639
moms

139
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,360
who are covering their scars uh with

140
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,840
makeup

141
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,840
and and i'm you know it's it's awful i

142
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,959
have moms who come to me who are afraid

143
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,239
to bring their kids to the emergency

144
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,359
room because they're afraid that their

145
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
their their husbands are going to be

146
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360
suspected for for abusing them but it's

147
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,000
it's their sons

148
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,120
uh so there's there's an epidemic now of

149
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,079
women who are abused

150
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,280
by their sons with autism it's uh it

151
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,758
isolates a family

152
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,679
uh it brings massive anxiety to the

153
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,879
family massive dysfunction

154
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,959
uh can often result in divorce and then

155
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,800
of course in and whenever that occurs

156
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,198
it's it's the mother who's left alone to

157
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,800
cure for uh these challenges and

158
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,720
when you think of as children transition

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
towards adulthood

160
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
uh what you know what are the placements

161
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,319
for

162
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,680
a 22 year old violent or aggressive

163
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:20,159
nonverbal obese uh boy

164
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
and there really are none uh that exists

165
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,039
so

166
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,960
so we have we have a major challenge now

167
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,759
facing us with what happens

168
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,959
in the adult world so i have quite a bit

169
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,479
of i'm a really a pediatric

170
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,478
epileptologist by training

171
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,680
so i see and treat epilepsy that's my

172
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,800
specialty but

173
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,199
in doing so i've sort of accumulated

174
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,680
a large population of kids with autism

175
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,600
and aggressive behaviors and i had found

176
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,600
that my own experience in the use of

177
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,320
antipsychotics anti-depressants

178
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,840
was really limited we still faced major

179
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,680
challenges in terms of

180
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,758
improving those core symptoms and the

181
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,079
most important thing to note is that

182
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,120
the use of antipsychotics although they

183
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,879
had been shown in those

184
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,240
trials to reduce the aggressive

185
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,839
behaviors they really did nothing for

186
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
the core symptoms of autism

187
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,519
they didn't improve social relatedness

188
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,280
or communication

189
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,560
which are huge parts of what we want to

190
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,000
do the other the other thing too is the

191
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,160
increased appetite

192
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,759
in many kids drives because the child's

193
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,360
hunger is driven

194
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,639
you actually sometimes paradoxically

195
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,160
increase aggression because there are a

196
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,879
lot of aggressive episodes

197
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,560
driven towards food-seeking behaviors so

198
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,639
the refrigerator has to be chained

199
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,519
sometimes so this mom so the first mom

200
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,280
uh we worked together on this this was

201
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,839
sort of a journey it was new to me this

202
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,439
was in

203
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:37,519
uh she came to me in about 2005 uh when

204
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,800
this whole field of cannabis was very

205
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,120
unknown to me

206
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
uh she presented many good ideas we

207
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,519
started first with marinol

208
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,399
as as a treatment it actually worked for

209
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,198
a short time but

210
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,399
started to lose efficacy and then we

211
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
discussed

212
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,399
whether she could find a grower which

213
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,079
she did at that time

214
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,758
i was seeing her in rhode island at the

215
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:01,279
time which rhode island

216
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,439
had medical legalization in 2006 2007

217
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,638
in that range but we still didn't have

218
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,478
dispensaries that could work with

219
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,639
children that were open

220
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,000
but over time she's published the mom

221
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,680
has published on this so she did a

222
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,360
series for slate magazine

223
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
called why i give my nine-year-old

224
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,038
autistic son pot

225
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,038
and the series has now been in four

226
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,839
parts i recommend reading it it's it's a

227
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,439
great

228
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,879
uh description of her journey her

229
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,560
personal journey with this

230
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,560
and she's very honest it's not a

231
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,399
complete fix and that's not what she

232
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,959
presents but it's given

233
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,239
her family and her life the ability to

234
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,159
towards

235
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,360
something approaching normalization they

236
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,280
don't have to

237
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,720
to live in fear of those violent

238
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,399
aggressive outbursts every moment her

239
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
son's actually performing much better in

240
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,879
school

241
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,719
finally making progress finally

242
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,478
communicating and

243
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,000
it's it's really turned their lives

244
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,758
around

245
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,199
so as part of the experience in treating

246
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,319
patients with epilepsy

247
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,960
of course the epilepsy world really

248
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,479
opened up

249
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,799
very quickly after sanjay gupta's

250
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,680
documentary and the number of phone

251
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,079
calls was

252
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,160
tremendous and actually if you look at

253
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,038
the rates of autism and epilepsy

254
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,439
combined

255
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,639
there there's very common overlap so as

256
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,240
many as 25

257
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
of children with autism will have

258
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
epilepsy many kids

259
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,000
somewhere around 15 of all kids with

260
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,639
epilepsy have an autism spectrum

261
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,478
disorder

262
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,240
depending on the study you look at so

263
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,360
these two are shared in common

264
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,079
uh very commonly you see two peaks in

265
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,000
terms of

266
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,839
when these present so you have some

267
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,360
patients who first present with epilepsy

268
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,439
and later autism

269
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
that would be typical for a typical

270
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
example would be a child with

271
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,359
infantile spasms or dreve syndrome

272
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
that's very common to see

273
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
they have their their seizures present

274
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,399
at a very young age

275
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,399
and then you have some who present with

276
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,159
epilepsy much later so some who first

277
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,440
had autism and later epilepsy

278
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,600
and there's a variety of different

279
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,160
situations where that could occur

280
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,879
and so of the children with epilepsy who

281
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,519
were medically refractory to treatment

282
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,000
which is by the way roughly 30 percent

283
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,440
of

284
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,039
and so you're looking at the total

285
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
epilepsy population

286
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,480
in childhood is close to one percent of

287
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,600
which about

288
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,278
a third are medically refractory uh it's

289
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
kind of similar in autism too many of

290
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,679
them are

291
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,800
many the core symptoms are trying to

292
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,079
treat the children are medically

293
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,120
refractory they just don't respond to

294
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,839
the traditional

295
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
treatments so so there's a lot of

296
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,040
overlap in these conditions so as i

297
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,919
start to see more epilepsy patients and

298
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,719
i've now

299
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,000
treated uh in the range of about 40 to

300
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,120
50 for epilepsy

301
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,839
within that population i have

302
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,320
more than a handful that have also had

303
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,680
autism and

304
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,760
had poor symptoms of uh of

305
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,120
aggression as being one of the major

306
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,000
components of what we were trying to

307
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,080
treat

308
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,559
uh and of those i compiled my data which

309
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,800
i

310
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,079
had slides for you but we we're looking

311
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,679
at roughly 80

312
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,278
or more that have seen some improvement

313
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,679
in the behavioral aspects

314
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,039
not just in the seizures so it's it's

315
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,799
you're seeing a combined

316
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,559
improvement and and this is a very

317
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,399
important population i think to look at

318
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,078
for many reasons

319
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,879
one is that the autism and epilepsy

320
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:10,958
co-population

321
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,039
they share some underpinnings so it's

322
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,000
not these are not two separate disorders

323
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,559
this is really

324
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,679
there's one single unifying diagnosis

325
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,958
here and you're seeing a variety of

326
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,559
different diagnoses

327
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,399
and it becomes increasingly important to

328
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,159
understand what the nature of that

329
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,919
underlying diagnosis is and how each

330
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,719
individual may respond

331
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,479
so examples and there are many but one

332
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,680
of the most common examples that we look

333
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,278
at would be fragile x

334
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,799
which is really a an issue of

335
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,559
neurotransmitters

336
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:40,639
so amg receptor and so

337
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,399
in those cases in fragile x in

338
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,439
particular you see mouse models that

339
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,320
have shown

340
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,680
a response in terms of in terms of some

341
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,480
of the features of anxiety

342
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,599
uh to to cannabis as a treatment to

343
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,360
cannabidiol

344
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,639
as a treatment and so there may be

345
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,320
specific uh

346
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,480
therapies geared towards fragile x in

347
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,959
particular for other

348
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,480
types of conditions you have you have

349
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,479
mtor conditions such as tuberous

350
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
sclerosis or neurofibromatosis

351
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,920
another very common population that has

352
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,480
both autism and epilepsy

353
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,958
and again mtor is listed on the pathways

354
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
that we had seen earlier today

355
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,559
you have neuroimmunologic conditions

356
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,240
things like

357
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,838
nmda receptor encephalitis

358
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,360
very rare condition but there are many

359
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,640
other types of auto antibodies that

360
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,399
might contribute to both

361
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,399
epilepsy and autism things like

362
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,600
anti-thyroid antibodies or anti-gad

363
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,200
antibodies

364
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,360
and again looking at the now i mean

365
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,920
interestingly anti-gad antibodies gat

366
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,959
is an important component of gaba

367
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,919
synthesis

368
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,559
and anti-gad antibodies are causative

369
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,958
for type 1 diabetes which we saw earlier

370
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,359
today

371
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,239
slides of improvement in not only that

372
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,399
but they can also

373
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,759
lead to refractory epilepsy in some

374
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,759
patients

375
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,559
and so as you go through these of course

376
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,078
draeva or scn1a there's a fair

377
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,838
percentage of patients this would be

378
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,439
more of a channelopathy condition

379
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,040
sphere percentage of patients in drev

380
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,399
who also have autism

381
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,559
and it's going to become critically

382
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,559
important to follow those developmental

383
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,000
outcomes as many of them are treated for

384
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,719
their epilepsy

385
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
so in terms of what's needed uh for this

386
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,440
so

387
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
as we think about designing studies it

388
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
becomes critically important to

389
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,799
look at development as one of the

390
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,639
outcome measures

391
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,958
if you ask many of the parents that i

392
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,440
see what is the single most important

393
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,799
thing if i could fix one thing

394
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,160
i'd say more than half would say it's

395
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,599
not the seizure it's the development

396
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,000
that they'd want fixed

397
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
and so so if if we can improve

398
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,759
development

399
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,919
and seizures that would really be

400
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,360
revolutionary right now the medications

401
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,559
we have for seizures do nothing for

402
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
development

403
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,759
and so to have anything that would

404
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,879
actually improve both would be

405
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,399
would really be a major change so

406
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,919
we have to follow development in all

407
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,200
these studies that's not an outcome

408
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,479
that's currently being looked at but

409
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,839
it's an important one

410
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,879
the other thing that would be critically

411
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,760
important to follow would be the

412
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,838
importance of

413
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,679
eeg abnormalities so what we call spike

414
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,320
wave discharges that you see

415
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,919
on eg when you're not seeing seizures

416
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,278
the frequency of those spike waves and

417
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,039
how that translates to

418
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,559
developmental outcome and developmental

419
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,319
improvement will be another important

420
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,078
outcome measure to to look at

421
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,000
we don't have enough data there but i i

422
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,439
have for my epilepsy population i have a

423
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,039
fair number where i've done before and

424
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
after eegs

425
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,879
and i'm in the process of counting

426
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,320
spikes which is not a very fun task to

427
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,559
do

428
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,079
it's a bit laborious but it's i think

429
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,919
important to understand what are the

430
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,039
effects of the eg not just the seizure

431
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,759
counts

432
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,399
and so those outcome measures coupled

433
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,078
with

434
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,240
better detailed understanding of the

435
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,078
genetics and the underlying

436
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
underlying mechanisms of each child so

437
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,879
we can better understand

438
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,800
what works best for each child and

439
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,519
the thing i'd leave you with is that in

440
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,479
autism as well as epilepsy we really

441
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,000
each child is completely unique and is

442
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,959
completely individual

443
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,958
and so think of snowflakes in this case

444
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,719
and i like to think of a butterfly as a

445
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,719
great analogy because we hope

446
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,920
to see that metamorphosis and and see

447
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,720
the child sort of

448
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,319
take hold and grow wings and so

449
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,320
development again remains a

450
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
critical piece but each child is so

451
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,800
unique and so trying to determine

452
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,759
that individualized medication for each

453
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,198
child is

454
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,958
something that has become far more

455
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,639
complex

456
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,000
and and we can't really do that without

457
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,519
that understanding of their

458
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,039
individual biological underpinnings so

459
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,360
that's the uh synopsis and i did have

460
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,039
some

461
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,079
really great diagrams and slides and

462
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,559
pictures if you can believe me so

463
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,559
appreciate it

464
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,440
we do have a couple minutes for some

465
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,639
questions so if you have a question

466
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,360
please step up to the microphone

467
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,919
hi i'm kirsten velasco i just want you

468
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,240
to

469
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,198
specify when you say you have results

470
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,120
from

471
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,719
let's say clinical trials or just single

472
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,919
trials you say

473
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,199
cbd and i think all of us want to know

474
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,399
is this a whole plant

475
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:05,519
is it isolated 98 is it synthetic

476
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,440
thank you sure so um okay so

477
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,879
what i'm referring to in my own patients

478
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
who i've seen and treated

479
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,000
i've worked with the slater center uh in

480
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,599
rhode island uh

481
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,879
with so for the patients when i was

482
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,079
practicing in rhode island i'm still

483
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,519
licensed there

484
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,078
we worked with the compassion center

485
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,639
very closely primarily many of the kids

486
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,638
were

487
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
for epilepsy many kids initially started

488
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,720
with ac dc

489
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,078
usually in about a 20 to 1 ratio a lot

490
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,399
of them are now using a strain called

491
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,439
auto number two which is a little bit

492
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,958
more like a 30 or 40 to 1 ratio

493
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,320
of cbd to thc typically in epilepsy

494
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,159
we would start you know i'd say

495
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,839
the standard approach uh that we would

496
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,639
use would be to start them around a 20

497
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,440
to one ratio

498
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,159
and increase them first to you know we'd

499
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,279
start around

500
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,958
a quarter milligram per pound per day

501
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,320
do that for about a week or two go to

502
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,758
half go to

503
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,199
three quarters and then to one milligram

504
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,079
per pound per day usually as you get to

505
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,519
about one

506
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,679
milligram per pound per day you start to

507
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,519
see benefit but we

508
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,679
bring that up to somewhere in the two to

509
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,639
three milligram per pound per day range

510
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,399
for a lot of kids

511
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,600
it depends on the individual and then as

512
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,559
you get to those ranges depending on

513
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,680
their response you may

514
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,119
choose to add thc to their regimen

515
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,159
and so that's just a rule of thumb

516
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
approach and of course then we're

517
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,360
checking their levels of other

518
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,399
anti-seizure meds

519
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,000
we're following eg data and also

520
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,320
carefully monitoring their their seizure

521
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,360
control uh so i have when i talk about

522
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,959
data i'm just talking about my own

523
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,440
patients i'm trying to compile

524
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,518
what my own experience has been these

525
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,440
are the most refractory patients

526
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,440
and and i don't want to understate the

527
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,720
importance of this a lot of kids i mean

528
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,240
in drove a syndrome for example

529
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,399
charlotte treve went back

530
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,759
and looked at her original patients and

531
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,799
somewhere around 20

532
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,600
had died by the time they were an adult

533
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,439
a young adult

534
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,360
this is not insignificant this is a

535
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,920
serious serious condition

536
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,440
so i don't want to downplay that but we

537
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,519
we i have seen

538
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,880
uh better than 50 seizure reduction in

539
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,519
the majority of these patients who've

540
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,679
responded

541
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,838
literally to nothing else that's that's

542
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,838
ever come their way

543
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,639
um hi good morning as more of a lay

544
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,038
person and listening to you talk about

545
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,720
an epidemic in autism and aggression

546
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,959
related with autism

547
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
and its treatment could you give me an

548
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,959
understanding though of what

549
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,838
you see as the reason or basis or

550
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,120
causation

551
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,078
of this epidemic oh boy that that's like

552
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,199
a whole other

553
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:32,399
talk that that gets so complex i

554
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,759
but i would just say to simplify it

555
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
we we are a product of our genetics and

556
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,480
environment

557
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,080
and and it would be silly not to explore

558
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
both uh and

559
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,000
so our and our genetics is influenced by

560
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,200
environment epigenetics is a major

561
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,960
factor in in development so i i think

562
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,038
it it's it would be foolish not to think

563
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,240
that both factors play a major role for

564
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,599
most kids

565
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,599
um but as to the specific environmental

566
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,879
causes and we see a variety of genetic

567
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,678
causes

568
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,280
that's complex enough uh as to what

569
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,679
environmental factors might be out there

570
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,798
that's

571
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,798
a whole other talk

572
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,119
good morning the the title of your uh

573
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,559
talk also references legal hurdles i'm

574
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,439
wondering if you could spend a moment or

575
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,759
two

576
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,679
uh explaining some of those hurdles that

577
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,200
you had and how you surmounted them

578
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,120
so that and that too that's sort of a

579
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,400
whole other talk but i'll get into that

580
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,119
a little bit

581
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
so i decided to do something on autism

582
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,239
instead because i actually think that's

583
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
going to be a major growing area but the

584
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,120
legal

585
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,399
challenges to either epilepsy or autism

586
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,119
as a clinician or major

587
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
because first of all the d i have a da

588
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,359
license

589
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,880
and i can't practice or bill without my

590
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:45,678
dea license the dea is a federal agency

591
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,960
uh it for it's specific i'm specifically

592
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,720
prohibited from

593
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,000
recommending or prescribing any

594
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
treatment that is

595
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,519
a schedule one and i to do so i could

596
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,679
lose my license

597
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,879
now that means my language even though

598
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,200
i'm really overs or

599
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,600
nobody hears from the dea do we have any

600
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
agents

601
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,519
i i hope not so okay so before i say

602
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,840
this

603
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,240
so i can't i mean ethically how how

604
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,678
could i have a patient where what we're

605
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,440
being asked to do from the state level

606
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,000
is simply to say this patient

607
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,759
has a qualifying diagnosis and that's it

608
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,440
and have no discussion further as to

609
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,200
what specifically to try

610
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
what does to do how to introduce it what

611
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,798
to do with the other meds

612
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,400
i'm an expert in epilepsy i've seen and

613
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,639
treated a lot of kids with epilepsy i

614
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
kind of know how this goes in terms of

615
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,038
how you introduce a med how you taper

616
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,960
med and and how you follow levels

617
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,160
it would be really unfair for me to put

618
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,038
that part of the

619
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,240
management onto a compassion center or

620
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:41,759
onto a caregiver

621
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,279
it doesn't make a lot of sense i think

622
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,558
we have to be directly involved in that

623
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,000
process but the state

624
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,240
doesn't seem to think that's a good idea

625
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,839
for some inexplicable reason

626
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,798
the second thing that's really important

627
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,639
to me as a clinician is that the

628
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,440
hospitals are not on board with this at

629
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,520
all

630
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,120
hospitals also have d.a regulations they

631
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,319
have a lot of federal regulations a lot

632
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,479
of federal funding

633
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,079
there's zero interest in the hospitals

634
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,240
in dispensing or

635
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,678
holding or having anything to do with

636
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,679
any cannabis product

637
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,038
which means that we're forced to you

638
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,720
have a couple choices you could

639
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,400
have a patient with intractable epilepsy

640
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,798
and suddenly take their meds away

641
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,960
abruptly which as an epileptologist i

642
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,440
could say is not a good idea

643
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,600
and and really risks harming the patient

644
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,880
but that's what we're being asked to do

645
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,399
or or if i actually

646
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
actively recommend that they use it in

647
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,080
the hospital i would get into quite a

648
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,600
bit of trouble with administration

649
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,759
or we could do a don't ask don't tell

650
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,399
policy which is kind of where we've been

651
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,119
but don't ask don't tell it really is

652
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,038
not a

653
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,558
i mean that's a temporary measure that's

654
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,240
not going to play out very well over the

655
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,359
long term we we need something better

656
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,960
and nurses

657
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,199
and doctors need really need to know

658
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,360
what's going on with their patients

659
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,279
because they're this can influence our

660
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,759
other decision making if if we're not

661
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,798
aware of

662
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,919
exactly what's being given so we need

663
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,558
obviously we need this whole thing

664
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,640
corrected and a schedule change would be

665
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:15,200
a huge help to uh clinicians like myself

666
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:15,200
thank you
