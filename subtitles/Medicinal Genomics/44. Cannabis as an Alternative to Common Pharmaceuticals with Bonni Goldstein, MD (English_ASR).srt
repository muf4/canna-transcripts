00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,000

132
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,839
back on episode 4 of the podcast where

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
we talked about cannabis medicine for

134
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,758
pediatrics great episode one of our most

135

downloaded episodes so any listeners who

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,800
maybe came later to the podcast and

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,479
haven't had a chance to go back and

138
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
listen to that i'll put a link in the

139
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,120
show description definitely check that

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,478
out

141
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,840
but today

142
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,680
we're going to talk about a few

143
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,839
different examples where cannabis can be

144
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,720
used to replace some medications you

145
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,399
might have in your own medicine cabinet

146
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,720
now some of these are over-the-counter

147
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,038
drugs others are prescriptions but

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,280
nevertheless bonnie you've identified

149
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,000
some common conditions where cannabis

150
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,239
may be a safer or more effective option

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,079
than traditional pharmaceuticals so

152
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,079
maybe a good place to start is with a

153
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,800
drug that i bet is in everyone's

154
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:21,599
medicine cabinet and that's nsaids

155
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,400
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

156
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
you're aleve your ibuprofen motrin

157
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,478
tell us why cannabis might be a good

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,038
substitute for these drugs

159
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,560
sure and just to add in there are also

160
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,079
prescription

161
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,079
nsaids like moloxicam and diclofenac so

162
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,079
it's always good for people to

163
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,959
always anytime you get a prescription go

164
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,038
online look up what kind of drug it is

165
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,159
and read about the side effects just

166
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,599
doesn't mean you're going to have the

167
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,319
side effects but it is good to read

168
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,639
about it so um what we know about nsaids

169
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,400
of course they're very common

170
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,160
um you know we

171
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,159
you go for a run and you know you're

172
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,479
gonna pay for it later you pop a couple

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,720
of ibuprofen or something like that and

174
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,800
so i think we don't really think about

175
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,319
them very much but we know that nsaids

176
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,439
can disrupt

177
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,919
uh the gi tract and cause you know

178
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,079
stomach ache for some people

179
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,598
can aggravate heartburn for a lot of

180
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,240
people

181
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,800
and even now because of that heartburn

182
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,439
there's even now nsaids that come with

183
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,918
antacids attached to them so like a two

184
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,519
in one and the problem with antacids if

185
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:28,959
you use those long term is you buy a

186
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,519
whole new slew of problems including

187
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,120
dementia you can get kidney stones so

188
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,198
um but

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,879
one of the main things that

190
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,639
nsaids do is that's pretty severe

191
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,079
is to cause stomach ulcers which if

192
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,759
you're not familiar with an ulcer is

193
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,318
it's basically a hole in the lining of

194
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,560
your stomach or your intestines and

195
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,240
it can even cause a perforation meaning

196
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,319
a hole all the way through which can be

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,280
very dangerous in fact i had an elderly

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,120
patient

199
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,679
years and years ago who came to me and

200
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,680
said you know the first time we met um

201
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,840
he said that he could no longer take

202
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,918
nsaids because he had

203
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:08,478
a perforated stomach ulcer he fainted in

204
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,359
the um grocery store

205
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:14,318
he got hauled off to the hospital and he

206
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,759
had emergency surgery for a perforated

207
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,400
stomach ulcer

208
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,720
from taking long-term nsaids so it does

209
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,719
happen it's it's not as rare as one

210
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,919
would think in fact there was a study

211
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,960
back about 15 years ago that looked at

212
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,878
chronic nsaid users and 71

213
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,799
of people who were chronic users like

214
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,278
you know daily maybe a couple doses a

215
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,639
day had evidence of gut injury so you

216
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,479
know no joke there other very important

217
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,399
symptoms that you can or side effects

218
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,480
you can get from nsaids to which nobody

219
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,519
really even seems to know about are

220
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,200
strokes

221
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,278
heart attack and increased risk of

222
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,278
cardiovascular death especially when

223
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,159
used for a long time

224
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,320
so

225
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,600
i always tell people you know your back

226
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,920
hurts and you want to take some

227
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,278
ibuprofen that's fine or you have an

228
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,838
injury for a few days but long term

229
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,200
probably not the safest medicine in

230
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,519
terms of that

231
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,278
in terms of its profile and one other

232
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,639
thing too there's negative effects on

233
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,879
the kidneys

234
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,039
and a number of years ago

235
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,958
there was this initiative called

236
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,799
choosing wisely and if you people

237
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,719
listening want to google just you know

238
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,559
google choosing wisely

239
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,959
initiative and you'll see that what

240
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,278
happened was

241
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,518
this group went to various specialists

242
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,759
and said give us the top five things

243
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
that were you know primary care doctors

244
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,480
are kind of missing on out on like

245
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,320
meaning

246
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
they go to an orthopedic surgeon and say

247
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,399
what's the top five things that maybe

248
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,919
the primary care doctor shouldn't be

249
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,320
doing in the face of back pain but

250
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,639
anyway one of the things that kidney

251
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,760
doctors put on their list

252
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,838
was

253
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,159
for people who have high blood pressure

254
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,480
or diabetes not to use nsaids and i

255
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,719
can't tell you how many people i know

256
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,200
who have high blood pressure and or

257
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,959
diabetes and take nsaids it can damage

258
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,480
your kidneys it can negate your blood

259
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,319
pressure medicine you have to be very

260
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,480
careful so um you know look the fda

261
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,959
released a black box warning on nsaids

262
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,759
back in 2005 and if you're not familiar

263
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,479
with the black box warning it is

264
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:19,120
an extra special warning saying you know

265
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,639
buyer beware and when the fda does that

266
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,720
that means there is

267
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,879
it's a serious thing so we want to just

268
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,079
be very careful with

269
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,799
you know

270
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,679
kind of chronic heavy use of nsaids

271
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,719
right

272
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,078
and so

273
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
when we're talking about maybe cannabis

274
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,319
being a replacement here for nsaids is

275
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,559
it more for that use case there like for

276
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,079
managing chronic pain or could cannabis

277
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,399
actually be used to

278
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,399
relieve acute pain

279
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,879
well so the studies support the use of

280
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,240
cannabis for chronic pain but more so

281
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,799
remember nsaids really target

282
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,519
inflammation they work on

283
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,278
stopping a pro-inflammatory compound

284
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,240
called prostaglandin

285
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,078
um

286
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,759
by blocking the enzymes that make

287
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,479
prostaglandin those are called cox

288
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,278
enzymes cox and so

289
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,039
um

290
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,120
when you're using nsaids you really are

291
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,240
targeting inflammation well look

292
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,078
cannabis

293
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,759
all these compounds in cannabis right

294
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:16,639
cbd cbg cbda thc they're all potent

295
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,559
anti-inflammatories this is not even up

296
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,759
for discussion anymore there's multiple

297
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,039
studies that clearly show

298
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,519
anti-inflammatory effects so

299
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,838
um when somebody comes with acute pain i

300
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,480
have to be honest this research doesn't

301
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,519
support the use of acute pain but i have

302
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,680
patients who let's say will have surgery

303
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,000
and they'll take opioids for maybe two

304
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,679
days after surgery and they introduce

305
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,440
their cannabis

306
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,879
they're able to get off those opioids

307
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,560
and we know that people stay and we're

308
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,360
going to talk about opioids i hope down

309
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,879
the line here but like you know if

310
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,360
studies show that if you're on opioids

311
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,039
for two weeks you're likely to have some

312
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,800
dependence and that's kind of gets to

313
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,879
the slippery slope of dependence and

314
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,958
addiction at that point so having

315
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,799
cannabis on board

316
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,518
helps with that inflammation and it does

317
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,919
seem to help with acute pain i've had a

318
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,519
fair amount of patients um

319
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,799
tell me that it helps with acute pain

320
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,240
and i don't disregard that i do think

321
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,639
that

322
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,560
research has lagged behind our clinical

323
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,200
experience and so

324
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,199
it would be helpful to be able to do

325
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,240
studies in humans right because we're

326
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,920
still prohibited so i think the answer

327
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,480
from research is still not there but

328
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,639
certainly clinically i see that

329
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,000
interesting okay so if there's someone

330
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,399
listening now who's maybe using nsaids

331
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,759
somewhat regularly and maybe is a little

332
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,759
alarmed about some of the things that we

333
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,838
talked about and is thinking about maybe

334
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,759
trying cannabis as a substitute what

335
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,320
kind of products should they be looking

336
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,480
for maybe in terms of the cannabinoid

337
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,040
profile or even just you know the the

338
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,600
route of administration sure so um

339
00:12:53,039 --> 00:13:00,879
because all of these compounds so cbd

340
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,240
thc cbda thca cbg cbc i mean i could go

341
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,159
on and on right

342
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,759
um lots of different so remember the

343
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,439
plant has over 140 different

344
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,559
cannabinoids that have been described

345
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,639
there's what we call the main

346
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,879
cannabinoids and some minor cannabinoids

347
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,839
there they're available people you can

348
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,399
get them um all of those that have less

349
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,480
than 0.3 percent by weight thc are

350
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,078
usually available online and it is buyer

351
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,600
beware so make sure you check test

352
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,078
results but

353
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,680
you could really dial in your own

354
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:32,559
um regimen there is no one regimen so

355
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:35,039
some people like cbd and are low-dose

356
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,199
responders for people who find low doses

357
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,360
don't work that well escalate the dose

358
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,759
and see if you can find a cost-effective

359
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,440
dose that can help but what i have found

360
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:48,879
is that combination so cbd plus

361
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,440
its precursor cbda can be a very nice

362
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:54,480
combination for inflammation because

363
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,519
they both are potent anti-inflammatories

364
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,079
what we know about cbda and thca which

365
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,759
are the more are the raw cannabinoids so

366
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,559
those are the compounds that come from

367
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,078
the fresh plant before they're heated up

368
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,319
we used to think you have to heat them

369
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,799
to activate them but they actually have

370
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,000
potent anti-inflammatory effects in the

371
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,078
raw form

372
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,039
i find that combination can work really

373
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,919
well cbda plus thca

374
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,319
and of course thc thc is a potent

375
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,360
anti-inflammatory

376
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,240
and

377
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,800
so

378
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,560
kind of playing with each one to see

379
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,719
what works best

380
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,479
we have a saying that people are

381
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,199
probably tired of hearing by this point

382
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,959
start low go slow but i'm going to steal

383
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,399
from dr dustin sulak one of my

384
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,278
colleagues who says don't be afraid to

385
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,839
go all the way so you can push the dose

386
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,799
look i have people just recently treated

387
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:50,000
someone one of my long time patients

388
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,399
who uses cannabis for like wellness he's

389
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,720
89 90 years old

390
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,039
he's in general pretty good shape takes

391
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,199
cannabis in a tincture form but he

392
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,278
recently developed gout

393
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,439
which if you're not familiar is a very

394
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,240
painful condition where uric acid builds

395
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,800
up in your joint just wreaks havoc you

396
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,198
know um so

397
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,958
he had seen a number of doctors they all

398
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,120
gave him medicines that he didn't want

399
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,278
to take that a list of side effects

400
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,120
so i encouraged him to try cbda at very

401
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,879
high doses

402
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,320
and what does that mean he took 100

403
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,759
milligrams in the morning and 100

404
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,320
milligrams in the evening and within

405
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,000
about five days his gout was it gout

406
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,879
pain was resolved

407
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,919
and

408
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:34,639
he called me to tell me i can't believe

409
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,519
that this worked and it worked so well

410
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,560
so

411
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,320
i

412
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,000
encourage people to try different things

413
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,680
don't be afraid to go high on the dose

414
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,278
of course thc

415
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,239
there's a much smaller window for dosing

416
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,159
and

417
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,680
you want to kind of tip toe up a little

418
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,159
more slowly so you don't have an

419
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:55,198
unpleasant experience but all of these

420
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,039
can be helpful for anti-inflammatory

421
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,039
effects and one thing that people

422
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,039
shouldn't be afraid of is using blends

423
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,879
because it appears that you can get away

424
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,278
with lower doses

425
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,919
because these compounds work what we

426
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,720
call the entourage effect or synergy and

427
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:13,360
they can enhance each other's benefits

428
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,560
and minimize the the risk of having to

429
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,720
take you know much higher doses

430
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,119
yeah absolutely and i recently talked

431
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,399
with um dr david miri who i'm sure you

432
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,198
know from the

433
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,759
um the the conference circuit and he was

434
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,319
talking about how the cannabinoids can

435
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,639
work on similar receptors and sort of

436
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
overlap in and sort of complement each

437
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,560
other with the whole entourage effect so

438
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,160
that makes perfect sense that um using

439
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,359
sort of more of a whole plant extract

440
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,439
that has

441
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,039
a wider breadth of cannabinoids could

442
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,240
could give a better

443
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,039
result

444
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
so i think a good segue here um would be

445
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,360
to talk about opioids since you already

446
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,480
touched on it and it also being a pain

447
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,680
reliever um let's talk a bit about

448
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,000
um opioids how does

449
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,679
their use differ from folks who are

450
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,919
using nsaids

451
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,599
and again how can cannabis be a good

452
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,798
substitute there

453
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,678
right so

454
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,240
they both fall under the category of

455
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,000
pain relievers right right but nsaids

456
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,078
are working more

457
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,480
as an

458
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:21,599
anti-inflammatory by blocking

459
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,318
production of pro-inflammatory compounds

460
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,159
and opioids work more by blocking

461
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,000
actually working through the central

462
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,000
nervous system your brain

463
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,160
and through your spinal cord by blocking

464
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,079
the pain messages that the body is

465
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,120
sending to the brain

466
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:39,599
and so um now interestingly enough

467
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,359
opioids are anti-inflammatory in their

468
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,480
effects there are some studies that show

469
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,119
that but they're not really used for

470
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,360
anti-inflammatory they're really used

471
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,719
for those types of pain that are

472
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,959
considered

473
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,360
you know difficult to control type of

474
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,640
pain you know cancer pain

475
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,639
post-surgical pain

476
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,038
when you read the research though you

477
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,519
know we know that people are using

478
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,759
opioids for long-term chronic pain

479
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,519
relief but they don't really work that

480
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,279
well for that and there's multiple

481
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,200
studies have come out and said we got to

482
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,359
find something else and you know

483
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
cannabis is a great option

484
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,839
um in that

485
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,480
uh

486
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:23,519
both canon cannabinoid receptors and

487
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,960
opioid receptors are kind of located

488
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:30,240
anatomically close together in

489
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,240
our brains and what's interesting about

490
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,279
that is that they can influence each

491
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,880
other

492
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,839
and so

493
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,000
um

494
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,918
remember opioids have the dangerous side

495
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,679
effect of

496
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,440
blocking your ability to breathe right

497
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,519
the what's called what we call in the

498
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,679
medical world respiratory depression

499
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,558
stops you from breathing if you take too

500
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,320
much

501
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,399
um and what's interesting about this

502
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,480
kind of combo of the receptors is that

503
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,320
if you target each receptor opioid

504
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,360
receptor and cannabinoid receptor you

505
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,359
can get again a kind of synergy because

506
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,599
we know that opioid receptors and

507
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,719
cannabinoid receptors can influence each

508
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,399
other

509
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,679
there's a lot of really interesting

510
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,679
research

511
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,519
looking at it and the science of it is

512
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,720
very complex and we definitely need more

513
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,519
research

514
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
but there's no question that people

515
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,798
can either

516
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,240
replace

517
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,279
um

518
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,599
opioids with cannabis or can add

519
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,759
cannabis as an add-on

520
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,918
and minimize the escalation of their

521
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,319
opioid use so remember with opioid

522
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,799
receptors you can develop

523
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,119
dependence and tolerance you might have

524
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,720
to escalate your dose

525
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,839
and that's when you start to get into

526
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,038
trouble

527
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,959
and it's

528
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,279
we have some evidence to show that

529
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,279
cannabis kind of can and i've had i've

530
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,200
have patients like this they take you

531
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,798
know three vicodins a day morning

532
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,120
afternoon and night

533
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,119
and now 10 years in they've never had to

534
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,119
change that dose or even sometimes they

535
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,239
can skip a dose because they've added in

536
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,119
cannabis

537
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,480
um and so i just wanted to quote some

538
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,000
studies because so that people

539
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,839
understand that this has been looked at

540
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,480
in a 2016 survey of almost 1500 cannabis

541
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,759
patients across 18 countries

542
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
86

543
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,359
reported improvement in pain

544
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,880
and 25 substituted cannabis for opiates

545
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,918
that's pretty good numbers right and

546
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,880
it's uh it's a it is a survey but how

547
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,280
else do we measure pain right um another

548
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,960
survey from israel looked at elderly

549
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,798
patients specifically because you know

550
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,200
the older you get the more likely you

551
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,240
are to have pain and chronic pain they

552
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,240
looked at 901 elderly patients

553
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,839
um that started medical cannabis and

554
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,759
93.7 uh percent reported improvement in

555
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,759
pain reduction from eight out of ten

556
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,759
down to four out of ten

557
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:52,558
on a scale and 20 almost 20 were able to

558
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,319
either discontinue or reduce opioids and

559
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,158
sometimes older people if they're not

560
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,399
encouraged by their doctor to reduce

561
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,799
they just kind of stay on their medicine

562
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,159
so one wonders if we you know pushed it

563
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,319
a little bit we probably could get some

564
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,400
of these people off and then another

565
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,918
survey that came out of california last

566
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,320
year 180 patients with chronic low pain

567
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,960
about 50 were able to stop opioids by

568
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,798
using cannabis and remember it has to be

569
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,120
you know you want safe access legal

570
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,879
access and you want lots of products to

571
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,639
be available so you know we're still

572
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,600
fighting that battle a little bit to be

573
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,880
able

574
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,439
but i think cannabis for sure is um

575
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,080
a strategy to help reduce the opioid

576
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,320
epidemic that we have in this country

577
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:37,519
that's excellent and i hope you'll share

578
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,879
links to those surveys and studies um

579
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,960
because we have a nice section at the in

580
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,280
the show description with uh additional

581
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,600
links so people can easily look at i

582
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,399
think that's that's great information so

583
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,639
again it sounds like cannabis is really

584
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,440
um where its place here

585
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,159
is

586
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,880
sort of in the long term use of opioids

587
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,320
again and not so much like you know the

588
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,880
acute use like you were saying you know

589
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,000
a post-surgery type of situation sure

590
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,159
100

591
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,079
uh for cr i mean chronic pain is

592
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,480
definitely uh

593
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,399
the national academies of science came

594
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,079
out and said yeah chronic pain in adults

595
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,720
is absolutely something that the

596
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,480
evidence clearly shows benefits

597
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,798
despite the poor

598
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,319
amount of research that we have and you

599
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,000
know in terms of products when people

600
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,720
ask how you know i'm using cannabis

601
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,720
doesn't seem to be helping me

602
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,720
there are studies that show that cbd can

603
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,200
help with pain and that thc can help

604
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,200
with pain but the combination

605
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,279
is something that can be really

606
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,319
beneficial so i've had a lot of success

607
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:41,839
with what i call low ratio cbd to thc

608
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:44,639
like a one to one or four to one so that

609
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:47,678
means four parts cbd to one part thc i

610
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,000
find that's a very nice

611
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,600
ratio to help patients one because you

612
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,960
don't have to take a whole

613
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:58,558
heck of a lot because thc plays a role

614
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,600
but the four parts more of cbd seems to

615
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,960
dampen down some of the thc unwanted

616
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,480
effects maybe

617
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,798
sure and

618
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,880
um i've even had look i have some

619
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,440
teenagers in my practice that have some

620
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,559
really complex medical conditions

621
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,360
and four to one seems to be that kind of

622
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,720
sweet spot ratio that works for patients

623
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,240
without

624
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
um

625
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,839
the risk of being impaired remember when

626
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,599
i'm taking care of teenagers i'm trying

627
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,359
to get them back to school

628
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,639
functioning learning

629
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,399
you know they want to get their driver's

630
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,880
license you know these are people who

631
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,880
are struggling to kind of get their life

632
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,360
off the ground and pain is in the way

633
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,000
whether they have a syndrome or and they

634
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,918
had an accident or you know when i say a

635
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,640
syndrome i have some patients that have

636
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,679
syndromes that are have you know pain as

637
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,759
part of it

638
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,679
and that four to one ratio just seems to

639
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,359
be a real nice sweet spot for a lot of

640
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,000
those patients and again they don't have

641
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,719
to take big doses that synergy

642
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,880
is there and can really help

643
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,360
and now is that typically taken in the

644
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,200
form of a tincture or some sort type of

645
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,719
edible rather than like a smokeable

646
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,798
flower that's right and so um some of

647
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,038
the adult patients i mean every now and

648
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,558
then you can find some flour that is

649
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:17,839
that ratio yeah if you can find high cbd

650
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,519
flour and thc flour you can blend you're

651
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,199
not going to hit on the four to one

652
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,839
probably right out of the gate i mean

653
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,159
you can kind of eyeball it but i often

654
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,759
tell people who are using um flour

655
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,080
whether they smoke it or vape it to

656
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,679
blend their strains i mean you get blend

657
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,519
their products because you can get a

658
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,600
really nice effect

659
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,720
in pediatric patients we use mostly

660
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,558
tincture

661
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,480
i don't know really of a four to one

662
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,678
edible that i can think of but in

663
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,919
general

664
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,240
tincture allows for that now if you're

665
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,480
using tincture and you have separate cbd

666
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,200
and thc you look at the label

667
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,720
and do the math to figure out what's

668
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,278
you know four part what ends up being

669
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,519
four parts cbd and one part thc so you

670
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,000
can kind of recreate your own you don't

671
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,960
have to find that particular product

672
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,839
yeah

673
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,960
yeah that makes that makes perfect sense

674
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:10,278
okay so moving out of the pain arena a

675
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,880
bit um let's shift to talking about um

676
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:15,200
anti-anxiety or anti-depressant

677
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,520
medication um

678
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,278
so first of all maybe explain some of

679
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,038
the the drugs that are typically used to

680
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,038
treat those conditions some of the

681
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,960
negative effects of that and then

682
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,440
why cannabis might be a good substitute

683
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,079
right so um

684
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,480
ssri selective serotonin reuptake

685
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,918
inhibitors you know fancy words for

686
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,400
basically saying it just lets your

687
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,320
serotonin hang around a little longer

688
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,360
and then there's some other medications

689
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,678
in the similar category called snri

690
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,199
selective norepinephrine reuptake

691
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,798
inhibitors

692
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,880
and for some people these can be very

693
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,918
effective but certainly

694
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,400
uh

695
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,559
not everyone and often those are the

696
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,720
people that i see

697
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,720
and also those are the people who are

698
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,120
turned to cannabis um the side effects

699
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,839
from these drugs again black box

700
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,199
warnings on these drugs for suicidal

701
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,959
ideation

702
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,120
um and there's some question as to

703
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,720
whether or not that caused you know a

704
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,199
little bit of uh

705
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,960
kind of over fear and people are afraid

706
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,319
but i kind of would be afraid to take a

707
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,038
drug that might make me want to kill

708
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,599
myself if i'm already um

709
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:24,240
kind of depressed and anxious so it's

710
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,918
you know it's fine a kind of a funny way

711
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,798
to treat people but some of the other

712
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,640
side effects agitation loss of appetite

713
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,119
dizziness insomnia

714
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,720
stomach issues and a big one especially

715
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,278
with young people but certainly old

716
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,400
people as well sexual dysfunction so

717
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,798
you know nobody

718
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,600
it certainly doesn't make you have less

719
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,679
anxiety and less depression if you can't

720
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,678
have an intimate relationship with

721
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,278
with someone i mean that's just you know

722
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,278
in terms of quality of life that's very

723
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,278
important so

724
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,038
uh and again there was a black box

725
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,880
warning

726
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,960
and especially they say for younger

727
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,039
people it's interesting i don't know if

728
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,159
you saw this there was an article in the

729
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,640
new york times a few months ago

730
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,880
two physicians who kind of pooh-poohed

731
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,000
the idea that you can't get off of these

732
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,960
drugs they have something called the

733
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,640
discontinuation syndrome that's been

734
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,360
described where like you can't just

735
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,919
abruptly stop a drug like prozac or

736
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,599
effexor or one of these types of ssris

737
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,759
because they

738
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,359
you have terrible side effects from

739
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,079
removing it right

740
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,599
and so they label it discontinuation

741
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,158
syndrome and they say oh it's no big

742
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,759
deal only 20 of patients

743
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,520
it turns out these two i think they were

744
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:36,798
both psychiatrists they wrote an article

745
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,480
for the new york times saying well we

746
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,158
tried to get off and it's really hard to

747
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,000
get off these drugs

748
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,080
so we're sorry that we did that to told

749
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,359
everybody the wrong information so

750
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,798
that's the other thing is when you get

751
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,639
started on something let's just say

752
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,720
you're going through a phase a difficult

753
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,200
time in your life right

754
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,200
do you actually need this drug and now

755
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,120
when you don't need it anymore it takes

756
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,558
you six months to get off of it i i

757
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,278
don't know that doesn't sound great to

758
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:01,440
me

759
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,640
um and we don't see that with cannabis

760
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,880
so certainly cannabis can substitute

761
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,799
there's significant

762
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,960
research showing cbd is a potent

763
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,158
anti-anxiety

764
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,759
and

765
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,080
of course the problem with these drugs

766
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,558
and with cannabis too is that can take

767
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,519
time to kick in nothing's magic

768
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,319
so remember you're asking

769
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,359
these drugs to change the

770
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:26,879
neurotransmitters in your brain so you

771
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,839
have to give it time

772
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,679
i do find with cbd that you know often

773
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,278
people are excited about using it maybe

774
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,278
it's a placebo effect but they feel

775
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,640
better hey who cares you know i'm happy

776
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,919
they feel better

777
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,480
um thc as well really can work very well

778
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,799
for depression and anxiety

779
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,360
dosing matters with thc

780
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:49,359
um and with cbd as well some people who

781
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,199
let's say take a low dose of cbd they

782
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,240
take i don't know 25 milligram little

783
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,080
gummy

784
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,839
and they do it every day for weeks and

785
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,000
say i just don't feel any better likely

786
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,000
you're under dosing and again that goes

787
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,558
back to don't be afraid to go higher

788
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,359
dose cbd has this really wide range of

789
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:07,119
dosing you don't absorb every milligram

790
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,639
so i've patients that responded 10

791
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,879
milligrams and i've got patients that

792
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,880
need 400 a day

793
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,399
okay and that's kind of where thc comes

794
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,399
in if you can't afford those very high

795
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:19,038
doses adding in a little bit of low-dose

796
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,119
thc to it can really make a difference

797
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,319
and help minimize tolerance with thc

798
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,158
help mineral

799
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,759
minimize any impairment

800
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,080
so again combination can be very nice

801
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,599
yeah no that's good advice okay one last

802
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,199
thing sorry i'm going to interrupt you

803
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:37,278
one last thing cbg counter-badgeroll

804
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,519
only on the market now for a few years i

805
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:43,679
have a lot of patients who report

806
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,440
terrific anti-anxiety with cbg

807
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,200
excellent excellent

808
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,600
no i was just going to say that i mean

809
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,480
with thc i imagine you have to be a

810
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,798
little

811
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,480
cautious in terms of anxiety because i

812
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,038
know a lot of people have

813
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,038
um the opposite effect of of when they

814
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,000
have a high dose of thc where actually

815
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,440
causes anxiety and i wonder if that has

816
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,880
something to do with the

817
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:10,000
biphasic effects of thc that i know that

818
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,039
dr sulak and others have talked about um

819
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,398
so

820
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,398
i just want to get your thoughts on that

821
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,000
like is it again it's probably best to

822
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,359
start low and go slow with something

823
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,119
like thc

824
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,639
right and it's good to start low with

825
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,319
the other ones too if you're new to them

826
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,559
but you can escalate a little bit more

827
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,200
quickly with thc you kind of you want to

828
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:30,079
just go in smaller increments somewhere

829
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,519
between 1 and 2.5 milligrams for most

830
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,398
people who are new to it you don't want

831
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,038
to go

832
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,879
and take 5 milligrams and then go to 20.

833
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:39,440
that would not be the advice you i

834
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,399
usually recommend 2.5 milligram for an

835
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,919
adult

836
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:46,959
and and uh increase in somewhere between

837
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,038
1 and 2.5 milligram increments to find

838
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,038
your sweet spot without

839
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,319
you know hitting up against what i call

840
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:53,519
that sealing dose where you're

841
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,639
uncomfortable

842
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,558
so

843
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,159
the biphasing nature is very important

844
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,240
very important to understand biphasic

845
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,240
means that these compounds can have

846
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,200
completely opposite effects at different

847
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,200
doses so thc and the low dose can be

848
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,798
very anti-anxiety

849
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,278
but if you take too much you can have

850
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,960
anxiety and paranoia and you know cbd

851
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,798
has biphasic effects as well you with

852
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,640
cbd you can have

853
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,558
very alerting effects at low dose and

854
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,120
say oh how do people use this for sleep

855
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:24,158
i feel wide awake but in much higher

856
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,319
doses it's more sedating so

857
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,640
until you've explored what i call low

858
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,678
medium and high doses you really don't

859
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,840
know what these compounds do

860
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,519
and so but one of the other things is

861
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,599
that there is a small percentage of the

862
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,038
population that just does in

863
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,359
i think it's something like 20 and

864
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:42,798
caucasian lower in other

865
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,918
races that are

866
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:47,200
um that people cannot metabolize thc

867
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,559
very well

868
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,558
right and so

869
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:53,359
you may fall into that category if just

870
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,759
thc does just not sit well with you and

871
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:58,558
again you don't have to use thc you can

872
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,519
manage with cbg cbd

873
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,599
um even i find thca can help there's a

874
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,200
very tiny amount of thc in there that's

875
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,439
probably doing something it is hitting

876
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,679
your reset your cannabinoid receptors

877
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,640
but i find especially in my autism

878
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,480
population thca works beautifully for

879
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,960
reducing anxiety in this in this

880
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,480
particular group

881
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,720
yeah and i think it's important to note

882
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,240
that with with all of these conditions

883
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,880
that we're talking about there is an

884
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,679
element of experimentation that goes

885
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,200
with with using cannabis right really

886
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,759
trying to figure out what product's

887
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,600
going to work for you but dosage um

888
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,240
maybe timing too i was going to ask you

889
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,480
about that um especially if you're

890
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,640
taking an edible or a tincture what

891
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,159
about taking with food or the beginning

892
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,480
of the day versus the end of the day

893
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,278
what's sort of the best

894
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,759
advice for that yeah great question so

895
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:52,798
um if you're taking cannabis under your

896
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,960
tongue sublingually or edibles

897
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:57,038
or taking uh you know a drink with

898
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,798
cannabis in it you definitely want to

899
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,960
take with food those studies are kind of

900
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:01,839
clear on this that you definitely absorb

901
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,319
more

902
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,599
when you take with food especially food

903
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,359
that contains fat so they did this study

904
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,798
uh i think last year the year before

905
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,158
where they showed that they gave

906
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:16,398
volunteers a little thc capsules

907
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,399
and um they did it on a fat what they

908
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,918
call a fasting state and then they did

909
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,319
it with what they called an american

910
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:26,080
breakfast so what do you think that was

911
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:28,558
loaded with eggs bacon hash browns

912
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,480
cooked in oil you know lots of fat

913
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,319
and it turns out that

914
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,360
when they uh check levels in the

915
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,720
bloodstream those those who took the uh

916
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:38,398
the thc

917
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,839
capsules with

918
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:43,038
a fatty meal or a meal with high fat

919
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,079
content

920
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:48,000
had higher levels and a longer exposure

921
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,079
interestingly in their study they found

922
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,159
it delayed the onset

923
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,398
for the cannabis to kick in but then

924
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,440
there was kind of a longer and more

925
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:59,278
substantial uh absorption and uh

926
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,720
evidence in the bloodstream so that's

927
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,960
number one doesn't mean you can't take

928
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,440
it on an empty stomach you can it's just

929
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,159
saying you're absorbing more uh when you

930
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,918
take it with food that has high fat

931
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,480
content remember a lot of the tinctures

932
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,598
have oil base right so either either in

933
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,440
olive oil or mct or coconut oil so the

934
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,399
fat's already there

935
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,838
okay um in terms of timing it's a great

936
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:22,638
question so

937
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:24,320
you know

938
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,399
in my book and also when i counsel

939
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,639
patients i kind of talk about first you

940
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,118
want to find the dose

941
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,800
and so starting low dose and titrating

942
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,240
up when you're not going anywhere don't

943
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,359
do it on a you know don't start

944
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,199
something new

945
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,719
when you you're starting uh you know you

946
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,719
have to be at a meeting or something

947
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,480
this is when you know your time off so

948
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,918
you can really take the time to assess

949
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,159
how you feel

950
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,078
if you feel better with your cannabis

951
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,519
pay attention to how long did it take to

952
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,320
kick in

953
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,239
how long did the effects last right

954
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,919
when did it wear off how long did it

955
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,078
take for the next dose to kick in

956
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,078
because all of that information is going

957
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,000
to be somewhat individual because some

958
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,720
people absorb better and quicker some

959
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,760
people metabolize slower or faster

960
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,159
so

961
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,000
you know for instance for me i know if i

962
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,838
take a tincture it takes about an hour

963
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,079
and a half to kick in but i know people

964
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,559
who say it kicks in in 30 minutes

965
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,560
well that's gonna if i know let's say

966
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,159
i'm having chronic pain

967
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,920
and i know it's gonna take an hour and a

968
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,759
half for it to kick in i am not gonna

969
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,838
wait for it to wear off

970
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,640
so that i'm going up and down with my

971
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:30,639
pain spikes i'm gonna know gee i know it

972
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:33,519
so last time i took it it lasted five

973
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,118
hours so at the four hour mark i'm

974
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,519
probably going to redose or the three

975
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,880
and a half hour mark so it's good to pay

976
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,800
attention and

977
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,640
oftentimes it's hard to remember so i do

978
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,800
encourage people to journal

979
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,559
or may you know there's websites there's

980
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
apps that have this but you can also

981
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,320
just get a notebook

982
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,039
and just um

983
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,240
document took this dose at this time

984
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,880
felt this

985
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,759
and this is how long it lasted and that

986
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,880
helps you figure out your timing because

987
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,880
there it's not like we know for instance

988
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,920
like ibuprofen you can take every six

989
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,599
hours

990
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,200
that's what kind of the drug companies

991
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,119
have figured out through extensive

992
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,358
research and so on but your

993
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,519
endocannabinoid system is unique to you

994
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,440
it's controlled by your dna

995
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,440
and it's influenced by lots of different

996
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,200
things in your life and so how you

997
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,760
respond to cannabis

998
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,358
we have to treat it as a customized

999
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,800
medicine or you're just not going to

1000
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:30,239
find you know what's going to work

1001
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,599
yeah that's great advice and yeah it

1002
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,159
goes back to that whole point there

1003
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,760
there is this element of customization

1004
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,759
or experimentation that just sort of

1005
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,720
comes with the territory but very much

1006
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,880
worth it

1007
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,598
when you can figure it out well and i

1008
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,599
say what what you know the price you pay

1009
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,920
is less side effects

1010
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,760
right and a chance to use natural

1011
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,079
medicine

1012
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,359
absolutely absolutely and that's great

1013
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,720
all right i want to move along here

1014
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:56,639
because i want to be very mindful of

1015
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,959
your time um

1016
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,118
something you touched on uh was sleeping

1017
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,519
um and i know that cannabis can

1018
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,000
be very useful for that as well but i do

1019
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,159
want to i want to say that

1020
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,679
i personally sometimes find the opposite

1021
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:13,118
problem and you kind of touched on that

1022
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:15,440
too with with cbd um sometimes i find if

1023
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,519
i have too much cannabis i'm wide awake

1024
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,358
i'm wired so

1025
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,639
what am i doing wrong

1026
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,960
good question

1027
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,039
it's dosing it's clearly dosing if

1028
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,519
you're using thc it's dosing so the

1029
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:30,079
first thing i often tell people is that

1030
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,519
in my experience the best compound for

1031
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,240
sleep even though there's lots of people

1032
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,480
out there that may disagree is thc

1033
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,559
it helps with sleep now

1034
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,039
in the industry people call it indica

1035
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:43,759
strains really when you're talking it's

1036
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,759
kind of a misuse or you know misnomer

1037
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,599
but really what you're looking at is you

1038
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,320
want thc

1039
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,320
in a and you want the terpenes which we

1040
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,559
really only touch on

1041
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:59,280
but uh the terpene myrsine and is a um

1042
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,519
terpene known to kind of boost the

1043
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,680
sedative effect of thc so when you get a

1044
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,480
combo of thc with a significant amount

1045
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,960
of myrsine you can get a nice sedating

1046
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,559
effect in addition you can get linolol

1047
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,720
in there as well linalool is just

1048
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,559
another terpene found

1049
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,639
it's cross species with lavender and

1050
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,960
it's very calming and relaxing and often

1051
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,039
if we can alleviate anxiety people can

1052
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,960
fall asleep because many of us we're

1053
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,239
tired but the brain won't turn off

1054
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,800
because we're worried about this and

1055
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,519
that the other thing so um i do find

1056
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,920
that thc plus mercenary linoleum is kind

1057
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,280
of like the first thing that people

1058
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,838
should try

1059
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,119
uh there's this myth that cbd helps with

1060
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,960
sleep and it can and but it appears to

1061
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,720
be in higher doses and in fact there was

1062
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,240
a study which i'll be happy to give you

1063
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:48,239
the um

1064
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:50,319
the reference for that looked at um cbd

1065
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,239
for um

1066
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,920
sleep and anxiety

1067
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:58,239
and they uh found that

1068
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,559
most of the people in the study did get

1069
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,959
relief of their anxiety

1070
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,199
and that sustained over time

1071
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,119
initially people did find some benefit

1072
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,319
with sleep but they lost that effect

1073
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,240
over time

1074
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,240
and that's so interesting but part of

1075
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:13,358
that is because i just think you know at

1076
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,439
some point your body kind of

1077
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,279
accommodates to the effect of cbd

1078
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,720
remember it's not hitting the receptor

1079
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,960
directly

1080
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:24,719
it works differently and maybe you

1081
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,119
accommodate to it so it just doesn't

1082
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,639
help those and remember why did it help

1083
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,160
with anxiety well we know it to be a

1084
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:34,400
good anti-anxiety um and again dosing

1085
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,920
wise they didn't go super sky high dose

1086
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,960
so you're not getting that sedating

1087
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,559
effect um one thing to say in terms i

1088
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,720
mentioned some ratios earlier when we

1089
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,719
were talking about pain i do find that

1090
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,439
for some people a one-to-one ratio for

1091
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,959
cbd and thc works very well

1092
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,358
and can help

1093
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,838
people who when they take thc and you

1094
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,639
say you know it keeps me up what am i

1095
00:39:53,838 --> 00:40:00,239
doing wrong it may be that it's just a

1096
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:02,639
little too much thc effect and you may

1097
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,318
get i call it it's a funny thing i say i

1098
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,759
you're like getting too thinky you just

1099
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,920
start thinking and you go off on all

1100
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,119
these tangents i've heard so many people

1101
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,480
say that

1102
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,039
i've experienced it myself but it's a

1103
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,838
i feel like that one to right one ratio

1104
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,880
allows the cb the thc to do its thing

1105
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:23,759
and the cbd kind of keeps it in check

1106
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,760
from letting you go too far with the thc

1107
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,000
but dosing matters and if you take just

1108
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,839
a little bit extra thc sometimes that

1109
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,920
can actually make you stay awake a

1110
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,759
little bit more and like i said some

1111
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,318
people are super sensitive especially if

1112
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,720
you can't metabolize thc so

1113
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:41,119
um dosing matters and if you feel like

1114
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,559
oh okay i took five milligrams of thc

1115
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,599
that doesn't seem very high and it's

1116
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:48,159
keeping me up well take half of it

1117
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,480
or even you know half of that

1118
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,399
again you may find that a little bit now

1119
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,000
the other thing is for some people

1120
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,400
they're able to take cannabis and then

1121
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,358
go right to bed like take it and go lay

1122
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,440
down with if they inhale

1123
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,239
other people tell me they need to take

1124
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,800
it

1125
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,479
relax for a few hours and then they feel

1126
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,000
like they can go to sleep so that goes

1127
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,079
back to timing

1128
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,239
pay attention to your timing try it both

1129
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,560
ways try it right before bedtime try it

1130
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,239
a few hours before bedtime because for

1131
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,318
some people two or three hours in is

1132
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,118
when they feel that fight that kind of

1133
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:23,679
full relaxation they feel like the

1134
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,200
anxiety's down maybe their pain is down

1135
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,279
and they're able to then turn off their

1136
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,759
brain and go to sleep

1137
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,079
yeah no that description of being too

1138
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,599
thinky yeah i've definitely

1139
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,359
been there and i wonder too because you

1140
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,440
said that sometimes cbd can be used to

1141
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:41,358
sort of counteract those effects if you

1142
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,358
had say um a cbd vape or flower or

1143
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:46,078
something when you kind of have that

1144
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:48,719
feeling happening could you use that and

1145
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,400
they could sort of help balance you out

1146
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,399
sure you certainly could try that

1147
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,000
there's no question that people do that

1148
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,760
sometimes if they feel that they got

1149
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,480
they took too much thc they try to

1150
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,800
counteract it with cbd they work a

1151
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,920
little bit opposite of each other

1152
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,599
um

1153
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,838
in their mechanism of action so

1154
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,599
sometimes you know that can work out one

1155
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:11,279
other thing i hope i could mention ben

1156
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:14,318
is that for cbn so cannabinol there's a

1157
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,880
lot of cbn on the market now cbn is the

1158
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:20,559
breakdown product of thc

1159
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,680
so right thc ages or thca ages what you

1160
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,639
end up having is cbn which is cannabinol

1161
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,559
um

1162
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,159
years ago somebody kind of posted

1163
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,119
somewhere that it helps with sleep and

1164
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,960
then kind of took off and i have to say

1165
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,480
clinically i just haven't seen great

1166
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,318
results here and there i've seen

1167
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,240
a patient who says oh yeah it helps with

1168
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,318
sleep or

1169
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,078
when i combine it with thc i get better

1170
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,239
sleep but i just haven't been that

1171
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,440
impressed with it if you read the

1172
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:51,759
research on it the and again limited

1173
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,358
research and much of it old

1174
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,560
there's just really no evidence

1175
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:59,039
whatsoever that it seems to promote

1176
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,279
a sedating experience so

1177
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,800
i just want people to there's it may not

1178
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,280
be anything wrong with you you may be

1179
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,240
getting misinformation

1180
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
um

1181
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:11,759
in uh you know when your product where

1182
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,920
they say it's for cbn for sleep

1183
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,160
there's really no true scientific

1184
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,318
evidence that

1185
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,159
that is that it really does promote

1186
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:22,239
sleep and i have to say that when you

1187
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,118
look in the research

1188
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,479
there is so little about sleep as a

1189
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,000
primary effect

1190
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,719
in terms of

1191
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,119
um human clinical experience i mean or

1192
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,559
clinical trials it's just

1193
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,000
it's usually a secondary thing like

1194
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,239
you're studying pain and then you ask

1195
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,318
people secondary symptoms you know is

1196
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,000
your anxiety better is your pain better

1197
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,000
you know interpersonal relationships all

1198
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,280
that kind of stuff but it's really

1199
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,440
interesting that here we are in 2021

1200
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,519
this plant's been around forever

1201
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,000
california's had you know almost 26

1202
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,400
years of medical cannabis and i still

1203
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,079
can't quote studies on cannabis for

1204
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,960
sleep because there just really aren't

1205
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,920
any

1206
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,318
yeah

1207
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,240
no and i guess that makes sense if if

1208
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,400
you're using cannabis to treat your pain

1209
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,399
or your anxiety and you know you're

1210
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,680
having less pain and less anxiety you're

1211
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,960
feeling better you're going to sleep

1212
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,879
better right

1213
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,440
so i guess oh there's no question that

1214
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,400
that's a component of it and and

1215
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,159
um

1216
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,519
it seems that um when you really look at

1217
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,598
some of the data that's out there in

1218
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,280
terms of surveys and so on that is what

1219
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,240
people are reporting

1220
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,319
is that my i feel better my back is not

1221
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,799
hurting you know my joints aren't

1222
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,719
hurting i don't have this throbbing and

1223
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,680
remember too that if you're busy during

1224
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,959
the day you're not really paying

1225
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:38,480
attention

1226
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,358
when you lay down at night is when you

1227
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,240
go oh my back is killing me yeah right

1228
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,078
so

1229
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,318
it would be nice to be able to control

1230
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,240
the pain and also all the anxiety that

1231
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,480
we're all been living with regular

1232
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,679
anxiety and then added anxiety the last

1233
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,079
number of years

1234
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,598
and um to be able to eliminate that just

1235
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,920
allows you to

1236
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,559
to turn off at night and you need to

1237
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,400
sleep you need that that restorative

1238
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,639
um sleep or you're just not going to

1239
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,838
function great the next day

1240
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,559
absolutely

1241
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:11,119
all right moving on to to the last

1242
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,960
um drug that you had mentioned here for

1243
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,240
that we could use cannabis to substitute

1244
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,119
alcohol

1245
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,118
um

1246
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,280
so again i mean i guess we're talking

1247
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,240
about sort of using it alcohol as a way

1248
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,440
to unwind or decompress after the end of

1249
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:24,479
the day um

1250
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,318
why do you think cannabis might be a

1251
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,079
better option yeah

1252
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,318
well and so let's just talk about

1253
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,480
alcohol there's no like

1254
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,039
equivalent to an endocannabinoid system

1255
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,639
in our body for alcohol right it doesn't

1256
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,199
have a target

1257
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:42,078
it does stuff to us but it doesn't have

1258
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:44,159
a target system it's the cause of many

1259
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,839
medical conditions including causing

1260
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,000
it's a direct cause of like seven

1261
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,279
cancers it causes cirrhosis of liver i'm

1262
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,119
not trying to talk anybody out of

1263
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,040
drinking but it's not my favorite thing

1264
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,480
when you're when you go through medical

1265
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:56,719
training you really do see a lot of

1266
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,119
hideousness from alcohol you know

1267
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:01,199
chronic pancreatitis duis domestic

1268
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,800
violence all kinds of crazy stuff

1269
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,239
and then you know experts have reported

1270
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,480
that there's no real safe amount of

1271
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,159
alcohol but why do people turn to it and

1272
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,599
exactly what you said

1273
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,639
it's legal

1274
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:16,559
right and it's easily accessed and it

1275
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:18,960
can numb you and when you ask people who

1276
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,719
are abusing alcohol while they're using

1277
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,880
it they'll tell you it helps with their

1278
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,118
they feel at least initially it help

1279
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,800
with anxiety depression and pain

1280
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,280
those are the main reasons that people

1281
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,480
use alcohol and so

1282
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,640
and i think too

1283
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,079
we can lump in ptsd

1284
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,078
in there as well because i think a lot

1285
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,720
of people do turn to alcohol

1286
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,720
um anyway um

1287
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,719
i want to point out a great article so

1288
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,959
this article was written

1289
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,879
back in

1290
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,119
2004

1291
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,119
by a doctor by the name of dr todd

1292
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,200
mcaria and if you don't know dr todd

1293
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,599
macaria so he was one of the first

1294
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:58,239
doctors in california who after the law

1295
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,240
was passed in 1996

1296
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,078
who was willing to put his license on

1297
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,358
the line and treat patients he was a

1298
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,400
psychiatrist with a very long esteemed

1299
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,480
career

1300
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,880
he understood cannabis and he wanted to

1301
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,199
help people with it and so he wrote an

1302
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,880
article published in 2004 and the

1303
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,719
article title is cannabis as a

1304
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,880
substitute for alcohol

1305
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:20,480
so it's a wonderful article i really

1306
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,640
encourage people to read it you go to

1307
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,159
google scholar put in cannabis as a

1308
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,318
substitute for alcohol and you can write

1309
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,480
dr todd and you'll find it so he

1310
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:31,599
documented 92 patients that he

1311
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,440
successfully treated who were able to

1312
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,800
substitute cannabis

1313
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,039
become quote sober off of alcohol

1314
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,880
and you know from a medical approach

1315
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,558
this is what we call harm reduction

1316
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,720
right we don't have

1317
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,240
cirrhosis of the liver with cannabis we

1318
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,159
don't see

1319
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:49,519
you know cannabis causing cancer we

1320
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,118
don't see cannabis causing

1321
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,960
cardiovascular disease or chronic

1322
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,440
pancreatitis or

1323
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,440
you know people beating up their family

1324
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,720
members from cannabis so again it's a

1325
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,880
harm reduction approach that he took

1326
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,480
but i just want to say something that

1327
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,559
just really stood out to me and i reread

1328
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,000
the article in preparation to talk with

1329
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,680
you

1330
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,599
and he made this very interesting

1331
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:13,440
observation that the patients recognized

1332
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,359
that alcohol was damaging them

1333
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,599
physically and emotionally

1334
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,598
and that cannabis was doing the opposite

1335
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,920
it was making them feel both physically

1336
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,720
and emotionally well you think about

1337
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,159
that

1338
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,679
you're going to put a substance in your

1339
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:28,000
body

1340
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:30,159
it should make you it may even if it's a

1341
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,760
brief happiness from let's say getting

1342
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:33,519
drunk

1343
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,839
long-term what ends up happening i have

1344
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:36,960
yet to meet an alcoholic who

1345
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:39,199
you know they don't want to go through

1346
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,358
the detox but if they could quit they

1347
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:44,000
would quit on a dime but it's not that

1348
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:46,400
easy and it appears that cannabis can

1349
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,800
help people so what he did was he

1350
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,318
encouraged people who had cravings for

1351
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,000
alcohol every time they had a craving to

1352
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:53,519
use their cannabis

1353
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and eventually what happened was it kind

1354
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,000
of shifted over from alcohol use to

1355
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,039
cannabis use and so

1356
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,239
um you know i i think

1357
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:06,639
certainly when you look at the costs to

1358
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,879
society of alcohol in cannabis i mean

1359
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,639
very low cost with cannabis especially

1360
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,960
since they're trying to

1361
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,960
hopefully stop arresting people for it

1362
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,159
but in terms of medical certainly

1363
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,960
alcohol is a much larger cost to society

1364
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:20,159
um

1365
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,119
and

1366
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:25,118
and and the question becomes is why why

1367
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,880
does it work well because it is treating

1368
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,480
these underlying conditions that you may

1369
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,960
have

1370
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,559
wanted to use alcohol for and so again i

1371
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,480
just really encourage you to read the

1372
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,319
article all those people listening it's

1373
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,480
a great article he just makes a lot of

1374
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:41,279
really interesting points and

1375
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,519
um even goes into the history

1376
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,200
cannabis was being used to treat the dts

1377
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:46,719
delirium tremens which comes from

1378
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:48,879
withdrawal from alcohol back in the

1379
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:53,439
1880s

1380
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:55,838
how do we ignore that in 2021 right yeah

1381
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,200
now that we have some science

1382
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,838
and that's a great point that you make

1383
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,598
that you know cannabis can help with

1384
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:02,639
some of these underlying conditions that

1385
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,880
folks are

1386
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:07,358
suffering from to turn to alcohol for

1387
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,119
sort of that that numbing effect but

1388
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:10,480
instead of you know replacing one

1389
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,079
numbing effect for another they're

1390
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,280
actually

1391
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,039
improving it

1392
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,960
well and he writes this little part

1393
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:18,960
about it where you just get blotto and

1394
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,880
it dis-inhibits you and you kind of go

1395
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,960
off the deep end with alcohol right you

1396
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,599
know you just have this kind of outburst

1397
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,159
where cannabis makes you contemplative

1398
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,318
helps you look inside maybe gives you

1399
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,759
some perspective on

1400
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,079
you know a situation that you're

1401
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,480
struggling to deal with and

1402
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,559
it's just a complete you can't compare

1403
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,960
them they're not equal right

1404
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,599
again you don't have it an alcohol

1405
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,838
system in your body that is a target we

1406
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,920
make cannabis-like compounds in our body

1407
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,558
for a reason it's helped to balance us

1408
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,159
to keep us in homeostasis and all you're

1409
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,559
doing when you're taking cannabis is

1410
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:56,639
augmenting that system we don't have

1411
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:59,200
that with alcohol so it's just important

1412
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,719
for people to separate because for all

1413
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,598
these years

1414
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:03,199
you know

1415
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,880
law enforcement and everybody else wants

1416
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,279
us to lump them together as drugs of

1417
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,960
abuse and i'm sorry cannabis can be

1418
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,920
abused but certainly cannabis is

1419
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,838
medicine alcohol is not

1420
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,440
absolutely that's a great point and

1421
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,159
you're right about cannabis being very

1422
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,480
contemplative when i when i'm having

1423
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,480
those

1424
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,720
experiences where i'm too thinky and

1425
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,240
laying in bed awake uh i'm i'm

1426
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:30,399
definitely auditing myself and uh

1427
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:32,159
i have a nice to-do list the next

1428
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,240
morning but that's okay it gives you

1429
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:36,719
perspective it gives you a chance to

1430
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:38,239
kind of step back and for a lot of

1431
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,838
people they'll say to me it removes the

1432
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,679
emotion so i can actually make a

1433
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,358
decision without being so emotionally

1434
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,919
engaged

1435
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:46,639
absolutely yeah it is great for that all

1436
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,599
right

1437
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:49,279
so

1438
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,200
thank you bonnie for for all of this

1439
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,200
this has been great and before i let you

1440
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:54,879
go i do want to talk about um the new

1441
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,358
publication that you were recently a

1442
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,440
co-author on um that was investigating

1443
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,519
using cannabinoids to treat

1444
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,880
children with autism spectrum disorder

1445
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:07,039
so tell us a bit about that and um tell

1446
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,000
us is this going to be part of your

1447
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:12,960
canmed 2022 presentation

1448
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,318
so yes i will include it in my canmed uh

1449
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,519
presentation

1450
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,920
so i joined forces with a company uh

1451
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,519
called canformatics and their websites

1452
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,240
campformatics.com if you're interested

1453
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:27,199
in looking at their what they do

1454
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:29,279
but basically they measure

1455
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:32,799
what's called cannabis responsive

1456
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:36,000
biomarkers from your saliva

1457
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,760
which can determine your response to

1458
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,599
medical cannabis so we're in the early

1459
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,119
stages of this we're still doing

1460
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,800
research but it's been about three years

1461
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,200
of r d

1462
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,720
and so let me explain you know the the

1463
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:49,199
research real quick and then you can

1464
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,480
kind of get what i'm talking about

1465
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,960
so

1466
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,599
i have many patients in my practice with

1467
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,760
autism and we selected out a handful of

1468
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,760
them who were already on

1469
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,240
a regimen of cannabis that seem to be

1470
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,319
helping them for at least a year

1471
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,959
okay so we've established that these are

1472
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,800
patients who respond to medical cannabis

1473
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,679
and what we did was you know going

1474
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,240
through a

1475
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,399
rigid scientific method we

1476
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,719
recruited them plus

1477
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,960
so they're about 15 children with autism

1478
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:21,118
and then we recruited nine children what

1479
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,599
we call typically developing so no

1480
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,838
autism no epilepsy that kind of thing

1481
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,760
and what we did was we collected saliva

1482
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:30,000
from all of them and in the group with

1483
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,000
autism we collected the saliva before

1484
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,400
they got their morning dose of their

1485
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,880
cannabis medicine and just be aware they

1486
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,519
were all on different customized

1487
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,000
regimens they were not on the same

1488
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:44,880
product or the same regimen some on cbd

1489
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,318
some on thc some on thca so

1490
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,680
a lot of different

1491
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:48,960
regimens

1492
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:50,879
and then what we did with the children

1493
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,639
with autism is after they got their

1494
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,160
morning dose we waited to what we called

1495
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:56,159
the peak effect

1496
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:57,279
when most parents felt was about an hour

1497
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:59,759
and a half

1498
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,160
after they got their morning dose and we

1499
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,559
collected saliva again

1500
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,639
and then we looked at the biomarkers in

1501
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,040
the from the more you know comparing the

1502
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:11,440
pre-cannabis dose

1503
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:13,440
biomarkers in the post and what do you

1504
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,960
mean biomarkers so

1505
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,280
these are compounds that reflect

1506
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,039
chemical pathways in your body

1507
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,839
so for instance something that people

1508
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:27,279
might understand is a typical biomarker

1509
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:29,358
in men is psa they get a psa test it

1510
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,240
looks for prostate cancer

1511
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:32,480
okay

1512
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,799
so when you go get your blood work they

1513
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,318
draw your psa and if it's elevated you

1514
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,240
know they start the work up to see if

1515
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,000
you have prostate cancer and then let's

1516
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:43,598
say you do have prostate cancer they

1517
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,440
follow the psa level over time to see

1518
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,838
are you responding to treatment did it

1519
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,798
go down did it shoot up reflecting that

1520
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:53,599
the cancer is active again so biomarkers

1521
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:56,000
are already being used in science

1522
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,440
you know quite a bit and for a lot of

1523
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,679
things including

1524
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,000
you know inflammatory conditions and

1525
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:03,759
cancer and so on so

1526
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,920
this group of what we call cannabis

1527
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,200
responsive biomarkers were already kind

1528
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,599
of shown

1529
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,279
before our study to respond to cannabis

1530
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,079
and so a handful of them that we looked

1531
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:17,040
at for children with autism one's called

1532
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:19,839
naa n acetyl aspartate and it's a

1533
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,318
reflection of kind of neuronal brain

1534
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:23,679
dysfunction and inflammation we looked

1535
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,239
at something called spermine which

1536
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:28,480
measures kind of pain response cortisol

1537
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,479
which measures stress response

1538
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,480
glutamine which is a neurotransmitter

1539
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,400
anyway what we found

1540
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,798
was that

1541
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,440
in all the children in the study that

1542
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:40,480
once they took their medical cannabis

1543
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,760
um

1544
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,599
that their

1545
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,119
and by the way the typically developing

1546
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,880
children when we collected their saliva

1547
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,358
that kind of established what we call

1548
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,358
the physiologic range okay

1549
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,480
so between two certain data points with

1550
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,480
a mean

1551
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,318
tells us okay within here is kind of

1552
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,719
what we're looking for

1553
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:01,119
to see if it corrects to that

1554
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:04,159
we saw a major shift in the biomarkers

1555
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,480
of the children with autism towards this

1556
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:08,879
physiologic range of the typically

1557
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,880
developing children so this is clear-cut

1558
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,920
objective data showing

1559
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,000
that

1560
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,960
medical cannabis in this particular

1561
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,838
cohort was correcting

1562
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:23,280
this kind of abnormal chemical pathway

1563
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:25,519
biomarkers um

1564
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,200
what we also saw

1565
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:30,639
was that each child's you know biomarker

1566
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,919
um

1567
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:37,039
uh pattern let's say was very different

1568
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,079
um and so

1569
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:40,000
it's just

1570
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,680
there's so many people out there saying

1571
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,480
you know we need proof that it works

1572
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:45,118
right

1573
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,880
and so here is some objective data i

1574
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,798
take a parent's word for it if a parent

1575
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,640
tells me my child stopped you know

1576
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:52,559
putting their hand through the wall

1577
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,318
and stopped self-injurious behavior and

1578
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,200
is sleeping through the night

1579
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:56,558
you know

1580
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:58,798
look i have very close relationships

1581
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,319
with my families i know when things are

1582
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:01,838
going well because they tell you but

1583
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:02,798
when it's not going well they tell you

1584
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:04,639
too but

1585
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,239
for those out there who want a little

1586
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:09,358
more proof this is

1587
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:11,279
objective data showing that we can

1588
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,519
correct some of the abnormal chemical

1589
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,280
pathways by using

1590
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:17,039
cannabis and remember anti we just

1591
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,599
talked about this anti-inflammatory

1592
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,519
helps with pain helps with stress

1593
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,440
all these biomarkers were completely off

1594
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:25,280
the charts at some of these kids and

1595
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,798
they corrected so it's very exciting to

1596
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,599
be able to show this

1597
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:31,199
in an objective way

1598
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,359
and so i'll definitely be talking about

1599
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,960
it more this is our first paper we got

1600
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:36,400
so many data points that we have a

1601
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,240
second paper coming out we're very

1602
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,720
excited about that so

1603
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:42,798
um and somebody might ask well to what

1604
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:45,358
end and so the way i look at this is

1605
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:47,519
that potentially down the line

1606
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,358
this would help me optimize treatment

1607
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,119
for patients so i could get a baseline

1608
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,358
before we get started

1609
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,440
maybe three months in measure this and

1610
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,679
again it's saliva it's not invasive a

1611
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,679
parent could collect the saliva at home

1612
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,318
mail it in

1613
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:04,639
and then we could measure to see what

1614
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:07,358
biomarkers are improving

1615
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:09,679
is inflammation down enough do we want

1616
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,039
to add in maybe cbda to help with more

1617
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:12,879
inflammation

1618
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:14,880
you know that kind of thing so

1619
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,119
we're not there just yet but that is my

1620
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,440
hope that we'll have some objective data

1621
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,200
the same way we use lab data now

1622
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,720
to try to help us make clinical

1623
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:24,318
decisions

1624
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,399
wow yeah that's that's really

1625
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,679
encouraging and now i'm curious we were

1626
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,200
talking about the different biomarkers

1627
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,440
and how after the cannabis treatment it

1628
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,439
kind of got more to the um sort of the

1629
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,639
baseline mean that you were looking for

1630
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,200
i'm curious

1631
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:38,798
was the cannabis increasing

1632
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,199
the levels of those biomarkers

1633
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:42,798
decreasing or combination of both since

1634
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:44,480
we know that you know

1635
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:46,798
you know the endocannabinoid system is

1636
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,838
sort of a regulator i'm curious if you

1637
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:50,318
saw

1638
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:53,279
both effects yeah we did and that's so

1639
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:56,480
amazing right so when the when the

1640
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,160
chemical was low it seemed to boost it

1641
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,000
back to the mean or towards the

1642
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:02,318
physiologic range and if it was high it

1643
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,519
brought it down again going back to that

1644
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:06,239
idea

1645
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:07,920
of homeostasis balancing

1646
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:09,759
and that's one of the most exciting

1647
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,920
things that i saw because you know you

1648
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,400
read all these articles and we've we've

1649
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,480
got all these um brilliant scientific

1650
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,760
minds that have written papers and i

1651
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,358
read it all and it's like oh it's all

1652
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,280
about homeostasis they hear somebody

1653
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:22,239
says i don't know i'm going to challenge

1654
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,240
that

1655
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:27,679
theory how do we know that's what it

1656
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:29,118
does how do we you know and here in this

1657
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,598
research

1658
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:33,200
we see that we can see it you know for

1659
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:36,318
instance let's say

1660
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:38,558
a biomarker was like minus five

1661
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:41,599
a standard deviations below the mean it

1662
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:43,839
would bring it up or if it was plus 40

1663
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:46,720
it would bring it down so there you go

1664
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:48,239
getting right back to that you know and

1665
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:51,118
it didn't bring everything into

1666
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:52,959
alignment like by no means but certainly

1667
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,318
the overall

1668
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,400
um results that we saw clearly show that

1669
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,719
these compounds

1670
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,039
are are homeostatic

1671
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:04,558
and helping patients achieve that and

1672
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,239
you know someone might say well these

1673
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,079
are kids are already doing well and so

1674
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:09,919
on but remember too that their

1675
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,680
biomarkers before they got their medical

1676
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,440
cannabis dose and we had we didn't have

1677
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:15,039
them take the cannabis you know we had

1678
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,880
like at least an eight hour wash out

1679
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,480
beforehand which we know that you'll

1680
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,838
metabolize a lot of that out of your

1681
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,280
system by then

1682
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:22,719
that they were kind of starting from

1683
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,000
scratch in the morning before they got

1684
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,159
their dose so

1685
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,719
um and of course you know it would be

1686
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:30,159
nice to repeat the studies the the next

1687
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:31,519
study that we're going to try to look at

1688
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,558
is is how

1689
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:36,318
biomarkers for neuropathic pain

1690
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,400
to see if there's a

1691
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:40,639
improvement in that

1692
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,559
and if so you know how does that work

1693
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,838
and so on so you know there's a lot of

1694
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:49,920
exciting um value here and utility with

1695
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:51,039
this this type of um objective um

1696
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,880
uh

1697
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,558
measurement

1698
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,640
excellent yeah and i mean we need we

1699
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,720
need more data so thank you so much for

1700
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,639
contributing that and uh we look forward

1701
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:01,598
to hearing more about it at canmed

1702
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,118
