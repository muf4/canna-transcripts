sc labs

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,600
and we're in analytical testing

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,960
laboratory we're located in california

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,640
we have a location in northern

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,519
california in santa cruz

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,719
hence the name essie labs and a location

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,518
in orange county

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,118
and we've been in business for about

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,079
five and a half years but i personally

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,719
have been testing

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,320
cannabis for seven years i started out

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,960
as a research and development chemist

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,558
um worked in small molecule synthesis

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,200
and then silicon polymer synthesis

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,399
and uh um just kind of wanted to get out

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,760
of it um

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
silicon polymer chemistry uses some

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,119
pretty gnarly chemicals and uh

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,120
just kind of was looking to see what was

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,479
out there one night and read a post on

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,359
craigslist for a job

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:57,279
and uh normal posting for a director and

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,479
analytical laboratory and

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
at the very end it said must be

29
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,038
comfortable working with medical

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
marijuana and

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,320
at the time i didn't i was not aware

32
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,118
that there were any type of laboratories

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,478
that would

34
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,560
test medical marijuana or that their

35
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,599
marijuana laboratories and

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,879
being a connoisseur of cannabis i

37
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,000
filled out my resume and i was just

38
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,798
going to go in and see what it's all

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
about is

40
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,240
more just kind of you know snoop on what

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,520
they're doing um

42
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,959
i sent it in about two in the morning

43
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,679
because i had to stay up late and make

44
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,118
my resume

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,320
and i got a call at eight o'clock the

46
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:25,519
next morning come in for an interview

47
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,639
went in on my lunch break they offered

48
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,319
me the job

49
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
and i didn't like my job so i figured

50
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,839
yeah i'll do this for maybe a year

51
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,879
and leave it off my resume and go get a

52
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,759
real job

53
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,280
and uh seven years later i'm still still

54
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,000
doing it so one of one of the really

55
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,400
cool things

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,159
about what i do is um that i've been

57
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,478
able to kind of sit on the sidelines and

58
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
see

59
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,239
everything that's happened over the last

60
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
seven years i i was there when

61
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,679
we found the first cbd strain as far as

62
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,839
i know that was

63
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
confirmed cbd for the medical community

64
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,560
in california

65
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,879
um it was a it was a og kush

66
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,920
um blueberry cross yeah that came out of

67
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,319
harborside

68
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,519
um and uh you know things like that

69
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,798
along the way i've gotten to see all the

70
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,158
developments and that's been really

71
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,000
exciting so um what i'm gonna do is just

72
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,920
kind of briefly talk about what we do

73
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
i'm not gonna keep you here too long um

74
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,719
what what kind of issues i see in the

75
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,439
testing industry

76
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,800
um over the years and going forward and

77
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,598
kind of share some of the data we've

78
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,439
collected

79
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,959
um one of the cool things also is that

80
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,919
we have a huge sample size we get to see

81
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,039
pretty much everything that comes

82
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,958
through the state

83
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,120
um and and it's it's kind of really fun

84
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,159
to uh play with the data and see trends

85
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,759
over time and

86
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,759
and all that stuff so um i'll uh

87
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,439
apologize if i hurry through this but i

88
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,439
got a kind of a lot to cover so

89
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,039
um why would we test cannabis so first

90
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,039
of all a lot of states um

91
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,400
california excluded right now but um in

92
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,280
about a year we'll have mandatory

93
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
testing

94
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
um but uh require testing and and you

95
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:48,719
know that's gonna always need to be done

96
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
at a third party lab

97
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,199
and and uh we sort of serve that

98
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
function voluntarily for our clients now

99
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,359
uh no one is required to do any type of

100
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,200
quality control analysis or or there's

101
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
no type of oversight as it sits in

102
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,560
california

103
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,158
and it's been that way um but but we

104
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
still have a fair amount of the

105
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,759
the industry that at least does some of

106
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,239
some type of testing

107
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,518
activity um not necessarily what they'll

108
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,039
do under regulation

109
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,039
and then the rest of these you'll see um

110
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,679
are are not necessarily um

111
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,679
tests that will ever be required um and

112
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,879
kind of going to what mark said and dr

113
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
jacobson said

114
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,479
um you know i i have a presentation i do

115
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
in front of

116
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,399
infused products manufacturers and you

117
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,680
know i talk about stratified sampling

118
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,080
and getting an idea on

119
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,280
on your batch batch runs and your rsds

120
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,120
and all that stuff and

121
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
everyone just kind of glosses over and

122
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,560
that's you know kind of a real problem

123
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,158
we see with with with our clients is

124
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,080
you know someone might bring in an

125
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,239
edible product that you know they

126
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
do a run every day and once a month

127
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,719
they'll bring in one of their products

128
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,000
and test it and

129
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,919
two months later they come back and say

130
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
well why is this you know 20 higher than

131
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,238
the one i made two months ago

132
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,799
um and and so i think um what we would

133
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,799
like to see

134
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640
is is is producers get a much better

135
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,480
handle on their production processes and

136
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,158
as people are getting more sophisticated

137
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,280
um we do see people that are that are

138
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,479
you know have a good handle on their

139
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
production processes

140
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,759
know know their their deviation

141
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
throughout

142
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,239
you know from from batch to batch and

143
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
throughout a batch throughout a

144
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,120
production run

145
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,080
um and product improvement and i also

146
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,959
agree with mark i mean i probably

147
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,239
shouldn't be saying it's kind of a

148
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,040
little counterproductive to to my

149
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,439
business but

150
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,879
i i see the big infused products

151
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,918
manufacturers and probably a lot of the

152
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,759
big producers

153
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,680
um having in-house laps and i think

154
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,720
that's absolutely essential i think

155
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,639
um the the the service that we

156
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
we provide is is more of going to be a

157
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,840
third party kind of verification and

158
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,879
we'll do quality control like for the

159
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,039
small guys but

160
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,000
the the bigger producers really should

161
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,280
be doing a lot of this

162
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
in-house so what kind of tests are

163
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,559
applicable and this is not even a

164
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
comprehensive list is cannabinoids by

165
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
far

166
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
what we do the most of and when i

167
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
started testing that's pretty much all

168
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
we did we also did microbiological but

169
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
there's only one or two clients that

170
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,600
bothered with that and uh you know

171
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
potentially for for safety and well

172
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
maybe not necessarily as much for

173
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,280
quality but for safety

174
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,280
probably the the least important test

175
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,799
until you get to the infused products

176
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,038
from fused products

177
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
obviously it's very important but um you

178
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,680
know for

179
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
for herbal cannabis that you're going to

180
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,360
smoke uh the difference between 15

181
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,160
thc and 20 thc is is is gonna be nominal

182
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,240
for the end user

183
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,919
um as far as safety goes um

184
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,519
microbiological contamination pretty

185
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,799
straightforward same thing you do in in

186
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,758
food testing applications the only

187
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,319
difference is with cannabis being

188
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,720
inhaled

189
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,719
into the lungs in a lot of forms some of

190
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
the some of the issues are some of the

191
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,440
pathogens are slightly

192
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
more or i guess less important

193
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,759
mycotoxins

194
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,319
pesticide residues residual solvents um

195
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
in

196
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,560
in solvent-based uh extracts and and the

197
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,360
products made from those solvent-based

198
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,000
extracts

199
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,759
uh heavy metals moisture terpenes um

200
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
plant fertility testing is something

201
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,759
that we're getting more and more

202
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
requests for

203
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,120
and then genetic sex determination

204
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,319
genetic sequencing all the stuff that

205
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,800
mgc does such a good job of

206
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,400
so first one uh cannabis measurement um

207
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,919
cannabis produces dozens of compounds

208
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,560
this is news to you and when we first

209
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,560
started doing testing it it was really

210
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,680
kind of boring um you know when all we

211
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,079
did was and then

212
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,400
when i worked at stepo we we only had

213
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,519
three reference standards available thc

214
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,879
cbd and cbm and we tested on a gc

215
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,560
and i sat there and looked at the exact

216
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,680
same chromatogram all day long and it

217
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,959
was it was the worst job

218
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,079
in the world but um but yeah so uh um

219
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,359
more and more we're starting to see a

220
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,959
little more diversity with cannabinoids

221
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,280
but still um thca

222
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,239
is is by far the dominant cannabinoid in

223
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,879
pretty much everything we test and

224
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,319
pretty much

225
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,839
the the only cannabinoid that's there in

226
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
significant quantities and most of what

227
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,279
we test

228
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,879
now there's three different uh

229
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,478
instrumentation instruments that that

230
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,478
people commonly use for

231
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,758
cannabinoid testing and and they each

232
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:44,959
have their pros and cons i kind of

233
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,240
always use analogy of

234
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,519
well there's a socket wrench there's a

235
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,038
crescent wrench and there's a tire iron

236
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,639
and all of it can remove a bolt

237
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,159
um but depending on what bolt you're

238
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,840
trying to remove um

239
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,360
there's a best tool for that job and i

240
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,239
think everyone's kind of using

241
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,000
liquid uh hplc liquid chromatography for

242
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,400
for cannabinoid testing now

243
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
um allows you to test the acids it gives

244
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,359
you the sensitivity that you need that

245
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
you can't get with spectroscopic methods

246
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,680
and

247
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,199
in the the lower limits of detection

248
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
limits to quantification and in better

249
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,240
linearity

250
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,680
um this isn't the the most interesting

251
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,639
sample of cannabis you've ever seen this

252
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,000
is a check stand

253
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,680
check standard because again i want to

254
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,399
show you some peaks so this is this is a

255
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
run on uh

256
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,359
uh hplc and uh i've

257
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,279
not seen mark's presentation even though

258
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,520
i do know him but this is

259
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,559
pretty much the exact same uh curve he

260
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,038
showed you if you

261
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,639
um notice it we've got the same numbers

262
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:33,360
um and this comes from the emerald cup

263
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,800
flowers so

264
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
um we test for this event it was

265
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,079
actually one of the first um jobs we did

266
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,199
when we opened our lab was test for the

267
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,399
emerald cup and we've been testing for

268
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,598
them ever since and so

269
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,439
it's really interesting we've been able

270
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,038
to see the trends over time

271
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,279
with cannabinoids and once we started

272
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,639
adding terpene testing

273
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,239
it's really cool to kind of just watch

274
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,960
the trends and a lot of these things are

275
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,598
seasonal

276
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,359
um they varied over the years um and

277
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,399
some of that data if i had more time i

278
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,000
would love to share it but

279
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,239
it's really super interesting but yeah

280
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,759
so this is the the distribution of of

281
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,280
cannabinoid content

282
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
um for the emerald cup and i'm going to

283
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,119
get back to kind of why

284
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,399
why i'm comparing the emerald cup and

285
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,720
why it's interesting data

286
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,799
um this is also from the emerald cup so

287
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,440
this is a total cannabinoids for

288
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,439
concentrates

289
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,240
and this right here is a comparison of

290
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,839
the emerald can

291
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,439
emerald cup the same the same

292
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,878
distribution you saw before

293
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,800
compared to our samples from october

294
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,960
and you know that so so the october

295
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,840
samples are about eight or nine thousand

296
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,199
samples

297
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,718
um and i just kind of want to compare

298
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
the emerald cup to our general

299
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,680
population of samples and see if there's

300
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,639
much variation and there isn't that much

301
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,199
variation with

302
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,838
total cannabinoids and in in really the

303
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,158
uh

304
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,080
the kind of historical or the october

305
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,519
mean um is a little bit skewed because a

306
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,440
lot of we get a lot of kind of

307
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,799
r d stuff trim stuff like that that ends

308
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,080
up falling under flowers so

309
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,679
you get a little bit our um wider or

310
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,759
standard deviation and you get a little

311
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,639
bit lower mean but essentially really

312
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,838
similar

313
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,600
um and and that's not too surprising

314
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
um but you know with emerald cup and

315
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
with the emerald cup is kind of the best

316
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,439
the best

317
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,759
norcal breeders that have been doing

318
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,279
this for years and in

319
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,200
most of them grow from seed it's it's

320
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,278
it's supposed to be an all-organic cup

321
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,240
and we'll get into that in just a sec

322
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,679
um and uh um it's people who you know do

323
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,639
a lot of breeding on their own so it's

324
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,120
really good

325
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,480
um genetically diverse pool to kind of

326
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,080
to look at

327
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,080
and uh here's some some uh

328
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,278
some distributions from you know

329
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,278
individual cannabinoids

330
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,039
the one on the left is is cbd obviously

331
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,399
most the samples had very little cbd if

332
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,599
you if you kind of

333
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,679
cut out any any sample that has um

334
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,200
less than one percent cbd then you get

335
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,919
the light blue line and you move it over

336
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,879
to about

337
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:51,838
um we got down here uh 11.3 percent

338
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,200
and so this is the um so so the emerald

339
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,120
cup is is a cup

340
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,399
so they have and another reason why i'm

341
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,039
i'm showing you the emerald cup results

342
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,600
is they have

343
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,879
very good judging process so we go to a

344
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,040
lot of these cups and in

345
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,159
a lot of the judging processes are um i

346
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,159
guess less than stellar

347
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,078
um they truly anonymize their samples

348
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,600
and they pull really really good people

349
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:10,559
experts in the cannabis industry to do

350
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,399
the judging

351
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,159
and i and i just want to illustrate a

352
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,078
point here so if you look at the

353
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,879
top 20 samples out of 487 flower samples

354
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,078
i want to believe

355
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,399
i want to say um there is uh

356
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,399
really no difference in the top 20

357
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
samples versus the overall mean as far

358
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,240
as cannabinoid content so

359
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,879
you know a higher cannabinoid content

360
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,639
isn't going to get you um in the top 20.

361
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,320
and it shows no correlation actually

362
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,519
there's one sample in top 20 that tested

363
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,640
like 32 or 30.4 or something like that

364
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,320
and kind of skewed it to the right or

365
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,120
maybe the the winners would actually

366
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
have a lower

367
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,159
mean than the than the general

368
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,838
population and

369
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,600
and you know i think that's one of the

370
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,040
kind of things that the testing industry

371
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,680
the disservice the testing

372
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,039
industry has done to uh i guess the

373
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,958
cannabis industry

374
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,439
is that when people started testing

375
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,000
cannabis and it started becoming common

376
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
it became

377
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,759
the score game who has the highest

378
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
testing strain and a lot of really good

379
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,078
strains

380
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,720
just kind of disappeared a lot of your

381
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,000
perps bubba kush i like confidential

382
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,519
i'm forgetting a bunch but a lot of

383
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,360
these really good strains that have very

384
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,600
interesting terpene profiles

385
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,800
were you know had had a lot of value

386
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,839
went away because they didn't test in

387
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,559
the 20s and or

388
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
in the 30s and and and so um you know i

389
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,119
think with

390
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
kind of our understanding of of what

391
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,240
really is important in in in that's the

392
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,160
terpenes

393
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,600
is uh um we'll start to see some of

394
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,759
these strains come back hopefully

395
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
and so this is where where you get your

396
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,600
winner so you you map the winner's total

397
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,360
terpene content versus the

398
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,639
the standard um mean and uh

399
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,879
you get a full standard deviation

400
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,720
difference between the two and so

401
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,000
um you know that's the only real

402
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
predictor of of

403
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,120
where a sample is going to rank from

404
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,799
from the numbers

405
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,759
is terpene content it's it's not

406
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:56,000
cannabinoid content at all

407
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,879
and this is just a chromatograph so for

408
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,320
terpene testing

409
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,159
um we use gcfid gc is is

410
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,160
you know ideal for for testing terpenes

411
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,360
similar to mark's method

412
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,559
uh you get good sensitivity a longer

413
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,000
linear range

414
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,399
um and and uh um really good separation

415
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,839
on

416
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,120
we have 34 compounds in our terpene test

417
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,959
and then getting back to the emerald cup

418
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,078
winners um

419
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:25,278
we have i i normalized all the samples

420
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,719
based on um based on their uh

421
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,120
overall terpene content so we're

422
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,600
comparing apples to apples and then i uh

423
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,959
um i i this is kind of a map of how many

424
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,320
standard deviations they were away from

425
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,799
the means this is the top 20

426
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
samples again and in which terpenes in

427
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,439
those top 20 samples were prevalent so

428
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,759
you see

429
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,040
um it seemed like the the judges in this

430
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,759
instance really uh

431
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,958
like their mercy dominant strains um

432
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,120
alpha terpenine

433
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,799
isopuegola um those are kind of minor

434
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,278
cannabinoids so it's hard to say how

435
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,599
much they

436
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,639
they uh contributed um but but they

437
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,519
definitely were there in large amounts

438
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,278
in the winners

439
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,799
um and a lot of these terpenes actually

440
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,559
track with other terpenes so you have

441
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,919
terpenes that kind of pair up

442
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,679
and if one's high the other's high and

443
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,439
if one's low the other is low and if i

444
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,039
had more time on i get into that but

445
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,720
um so yeah and then terpinoline alpha

446
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,120
pine and beta pinene we're all

447
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,079
we're all relatively abundant in in the

448
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,879
the

449
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,638
desirable strains and i also mean that's

450
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,958
another one

451
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
um and then here here's uh the mercin in

452
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,919
emerald cup flowers if you

453
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,440
graph it like that you get something

454
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,319
like that but then if you normalize it

455
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
for

456
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,000
with the overall terpene content most of

457
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,079
your terpenes start to look like this

458
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,759
you have um or at least the major ones

459
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,919
you have a lot of samples that have very

460
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,039
little a third to a half of them and

461
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,078
then you kind of have this even

462
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,559
distribution um

463
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,399
you know in in in in certain terpenes

464
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,439
you know mercy goes all the way out to

465
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,320
75 of the overall terpene content and

466
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,560
you have uh

467
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,480
limonene that doesn't necessarily get as

468
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,119
high but very similar

469
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
very similar uh histogram but then the

470
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,560
only one that's kind of

471
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,078
interesting is trapinoline and these two

472
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,638
pineally dominant strains i i cut the

473
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,319
top off this so 377 strains out of the

474
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,519
470 had essentially

475
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,879
no interpenaling and then you had

476
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,879
this handful of strains that had a whole

477
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,519
bunch of it and there's your penduline

478
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,799
dominant but

479
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,240
it's just it's one of the terpenes that

480
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,039
kind of behaves like like none of the

481
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
others

482
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,480
just kind of interesting um

483
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,759
so this is the chirping content of

484
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,159
concentrates and if

485
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,278
if i had shown you the the slides where

486
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,120
where we saw the winners

487
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,600
here you would see that all the winners

488
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,320
were in the last last three

489
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,360
bars um with terpenes so with the

490
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,519
concentrates

491
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,399
um high chirping content was even even a

492
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,360
greater predictor

493
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,278
of where the the the um sample would

494
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,159
actually end up scoring in in the cup

495
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,360
and i don't know what happened to my

496
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,799
distribution curve there it looks a

497
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,360
little wonky but

498
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,479
um all right so the next test that um

499
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,120
you know it's kind of important

500
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,759
in in in part of basically any state

501
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,320
that's that's

502
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,159
requiring intestines regulations is uh

503
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,040
is microbiological testing

504
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,679
and uh these are all three petri dishes

505
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,679
with asp

506
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,039
different species aspergillus and i

507
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,479
didn't put aspergillus on this list for

508
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,799
some reason but uh

509
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,639
these are the kind of common tests um

510
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,919
california is going to be requiring apc

511
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,879
total yeast in mold e coli coliforms

512
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,559
salmonella shigella and then listeria

513
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,159
and pseudomonas in some places

514
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,679
um pseudomonas is required in the city

515
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,278
of berkeley i don't know of too many

516
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,559
states that don't require it and it's

517
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,240
pretty debatable whether

518
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,399
anyone should be requiring pseudomonas

519
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,799
testing i'm against it but

520
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,320
it's two that's a whole different story

521
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,719
listeria for for some

522
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,759
food based uh infused products i think

523
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,720
makes sense

524
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,199
general cannabis probably not and then

525
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,278
again

526
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,958
just give you kind of idea what you know

527
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,159
what happens with samples again the

528
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,239
emerald cup is supposed to be all

529
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,600
outdoor so this this would be an

530
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,360
outdoor kind of more of a homogeneous

531
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,639
sample than our general sample size but

532
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,600
if you look at the general samples that

533
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,879
come through the door

534
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,159
the numbers are almost identical i

535
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,360
didn't even make another slide to show

536
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,159
you those because they're almost

537
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,839
identical

538
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,039
um and these are based on the ahpa

539
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,240
guidelines um so apc

540
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:01,278
um 2.7 were over the hpa limit for

541
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,759
for apc aerobic play count um yeast and

542
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,198
mold

543
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:08,560
is always trouble um at 100 000 um

544
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:12,000
cfus per gram uh that's the one we have

545
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,838
the most failures i guess with and uh

546
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,278
pseudomonas none of them failed under

547
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,240
the the well that was berkeley

548
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:17,919
regulations

549
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,600
salmonella we didn't detect any

550
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,078
salmonella in the

551
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,680
in the emerald cup samples coliforms one

552
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,559
point seven percent were over the limit

553
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,439
e coli four percent had e coli um so as

554
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,599
you can see

555
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,639
um other than yeast and mold even an

556
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,879
outdoor crop

557
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,159
um produced by you know all different

558
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,198
people can can uh

559
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,120
um come in come in pretty uh

560
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,159
pretty pretty safely under the limits

561
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,198
that are kind of being established out

562
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,879
there and the hpa guidelines kind of

563
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,240
being adopted everywhere

564
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,759
um pesticide residues so pesticides are

565
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,919
a really big issue for us now

566
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,278
um and it was a really big issue um

567
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,240
starting with emerald cup testing

568
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,838
because this is the first year we did

569
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,519
pesticide testing for them and

570
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,959
uh it's supposed to be an all-organic

571
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,480
cup so um

572
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,479
of course no one used pesticides in

573
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,360
their plants and i'm sure that's that's

574
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
the way it was and

575
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,798
and so it was definitely a big

576
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,880
controversy but it really i think kind

577
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,160
of sparked a conversation and it was

578
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
you know it's kind of a little scary but

579
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,199
fun to be a part of it um and

580
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,880
and and for us um our pesticide assay

581
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,160
again we're not in a regulated market no

582
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,319
one's being forced to test so

583
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,759
our our pesticide assay is actually very

584
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,399
basic and our rsd

585
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,558
our limits of detection are are

586
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,360
relatively high they're probably

587
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,839
um 10 to 100 times higher than than the

588
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,000
action levels in in oregon so so

589
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,359
they're very generous and in we do that

590
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,079
a to keep costs down

591
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,918
and uh um again to kind of incentivize

592
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,038
people to do the testing and it saves us

593
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,559
you know kind of expensive sample

594
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,440
cleanup and as you can see

595
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,839
um it's still we still see plenty of

596
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,279
failures so

597
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,159
um let me go just straight to this thing

598
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,839
i'm gonna

599
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
i'm running out of time here but uh um

600
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,279
these are failure rates i took the month

601
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,119
before the emerald cup in the

602
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,399
three months following the emerald cup

603
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,319
i'm just kind of showing our overall

604
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,200
failure rates for pesticides

605
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,599
um and thermal cup you know it was much

606
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,519
better

607
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,798
than the means so so most of the people

608
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,240
were pretty honest and then i think

609
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,720
there was a few people that

610
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,160
um you know and i guess that's the fun

611
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,038
thing we use you know a

612
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,240
conformational mass spectrometer lcms ms

613
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,079
with triple quad

614
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,839
so you know it's very hard to get a

615
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,879
false positive um

616
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:20,159
obviously if something's below or

617
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,440
limited detection it's going to sneak

618
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,720
through but but it's very hard to get a

619
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,240
false positive so it's the next thing

620
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,480
with the pesticide test and

621
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,079
and um you know a couple times the the

622
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,519
laboratory issue got brought up and

623
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,119
i agree wholeheartedly one of the big

624
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,639
issues with with laboratories is

625
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,839
there has been very little oversight and

626
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,679
california did a really good thing with

627
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,159
their new regulations by requiring

628
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,840
everyone to get iso 17025 certified

629
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,160
that's kind of the bare minimum

630
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,519
analytical laboratory should meet and

631
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,080
hopefully that'll that'll help things

632
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,000
but

633
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,279
um you know cannabis laboratories are no

634
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,240
longer different than environmental

635
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,038
laboratories or

636
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,599
or any other um i guess you know

637
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,599
analytical or diagnostic laboratory

638
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,798
um there's always going to be incentive

639
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,000
to to not

640
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,558
fail people and there's always going to

641
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,558
be incentive to uh um cut corners

642
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,599
it's it's tight margins our margins

643
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,720
aren't necessarily the same as the

644
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,719
cannabis industry and

645
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,400
and right now in california someone can

646
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,079
throw a gc in the back of a van or even

647
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,038
a near infrared in the back of a van and

648
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,399
drive around and call themselves a

649
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,519
testing laboratory and that's who we're

650
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,798
competing with so

651
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,240
um i i get it i understand but uh um

652
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,759
across the board with the pesticide test

653
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,279
it's nice because we don't get a lot of

654
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,440
that because uh

655
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,038
you know 99 out of 100 times someone

656
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
comes up to you and well why did i fail

657
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,359
this and

658
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,798
you know i failed for michael butano

659
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,479
what's up with that and well did you use

660
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,119
eagle 20 oh yeah well that's

661
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,640
i can't use eagle 20. so i think also

662
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,000
too and with kind of the

663
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,400
grower community as they get more

664
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,200
sophisticated uh you'll see a lot less

665
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,080
mistakes but uh um yeah so october we

666
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,000
had 49

667
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,599
of our our samples we saw failed and

668
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,319
again pesticide testing

669
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,119
and the the the pesticides we detect in

670
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,159
samples

671
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,000
it it varies seasonally and so october

672
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,519
is kind of the outdoor crop coming in

673
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,279
we got some rain early in the season

674
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,759
right before harvest um

675
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,839
people probably had to uh to resort to

676
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,720
the microbutanol which is a fungicide

677
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,240
and so uh we failed 49 of the the

678
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
pesticide samples that came in the door

679
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,798
then and

680
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,080
and actually you know we don't do every

681
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,720
test we get through the door isn't

682
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,079
necessarily tested for pesticides so

683
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,079
um you know these are people that kind

684
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,158
of i guess

685
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,279
theoretically would have self-selected

686
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,280
for for testing

687
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,639
um and and still half of them half of

688
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,918
them failed um

689
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,360
and then it got a little bit better

690
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,919
after the emerald cup um after the

691
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,599
emerald cup

692
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,679
we definitely lost some clients which

693
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,599
which is fine and uh um

694
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,440
and in you know people knew that you

695
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,240
know not to bring their stuff in so

696
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,840
um if they'd use pesticides so so it's

697
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,038
actually kind of steadily declined since

698
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,759
then which is which is kind of

699
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,400
interesting

700
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,359
um and uh again yeah the emerald cup we

701
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,440
still 13

702
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,359
of the the samples had had one or

703
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,120
another one or two pesticides

704
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,599
or three i think a couple had three but

705
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,038
uh um yeah so

706
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,558
back up here that's just a graph and

707
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,519
those are the pesticides that we test

708
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,839
for so we only have

709
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,798
i think 12 up there um and we selected

710
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,240
those because those are the ones people

711
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,440
are actually using so

712
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,798
um you know with cannabis your big pest

713
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,480
and your big pest concern is going to be

714
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,440
mites there's aphids and there's thrips

715
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,640
and there's a few other things that will

716
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,798
attack cannabis

717
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,159
but but what people with what destroys

718
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,279
crops and in in

719
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,280
in people's biggest concern when it

720
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,558
comes to cannabis are mites so there's a

721
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,200
handful of pesticides that are people

722
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,599
are using

723
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,798
to to kill the mites and there's a you

724
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,158
know there's there's one or two

725
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,918
fungicides people use and there's a

726
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,240
couple plant growth regulators so

727
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,080
um paclibutrizol and diminized are

728
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,960
actually plant growth regulators and

729
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,319
um those those are compounds that were

730
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,640
packaged in a lot of hydroponics

731
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,200
products kind of sneakily too we're 99

732
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,799
natural and not necessarily labeled and

733
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,720
they're making buds really hard and they

734
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,599
keep the plants nice and short and

735
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,519
and improve your yields 20 30 40 percent

736
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,000
and and you know why wouldn't i use it

737
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,720
and uh um we've seen a lot less of that

738
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,079
now there's

739
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,159
it's been harder to get a lot of the

740
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,359
products have had have had diminished

741
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,360
impeccable beaches all pulled because

742
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,439
they're not meant for any type of

743
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,439
crop that's used for human consumption

744
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,519
and uh and people have kind of gotten

745
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,038
gotten hip too and by and large your

746
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,759
your cannabis producers aren't aren't

747
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,038
trying to

748
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,720
to do it wrong a lot of them a lot of

749
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,319
them have the best intentions and just

750
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,240
just didn't know any better so

751
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,599
um we see less and less packed leviticus

752
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,079
all in dimension but that's that's our

753
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,240
pesticide

754
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,439
assay and we're still still failing 50

755
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,599
of the people and and again

756
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,880
um you know with that's not necessarily

757
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,279
the case across the board there's a

758
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,280
there's

759
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,879
um you know a lot of labs that test for

760
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,480
60 100 they they do a

761
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,000
whole panel for agrano chlorines it's an

762
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,200
eliza kid and

763
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,839
everyone passes so um we have 12

764
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
and we fail 50 and we have really bad

765
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,359
limits of detection

766
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,400
but again that those will decrease by

767
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,639
about a thousand times

768
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,559
when when regulations come in so those

769
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,400
numbers will go up a little bit

770
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,678
um and then i just want to briefly touch

771
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,640
on residual solvents because i think i'm

772
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,120
out of time

773
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,880
um and so yeah so residual solvents with

774
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,599
with solvent extracts coming on on the

775
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,280
scene and

776
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,038
and the kind of the extraction histogram

777
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,599
i showed you for the emerald cup

778
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,519
um you know the there's a lot of samples

779
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,480
that came in 40 50 60

780
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,519
um cannabinoids and that's because it's

781
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,798
an organic cup

782
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,119
all the concentrates were supposed to be

783
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,639
solventless and

784
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,239
we see less and less of those if you

785
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,038
show the general population histogram

786
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,240
for

787
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,679
what we see for concentrates 95 to 96

788
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,400
percent of the concentrates we see now

789
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,400
are all

790
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
either solvent extracts or co2 extracts

791
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,519
and there's there's very little water

792
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,918
hash there's very little key

793
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,119
out there these days um and and it's

794
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,960
just kind of what the market is

795
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,319
is determined whereas you know five six

796
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,079
years ago um

797
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,079
it was probably flip-flopped you'd see

798
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,839
maybe 80 or 90 percent

799
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,119
keef in in in water hash you mean once

800
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,918
in a while you get a really cool salomon

801
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,759
extract in

802
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,679
gonna be unique but but with kind of

803
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,158
dabbing coming on and all that stuff

804
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,200
um we see very little of the of the old

805
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,039
type extracts so

806
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,798
residual solvent analysis pretty simple

807
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,240
um instead of dissolving your sample in

808
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,839
a liquid and having all your gases that

809
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,558
you're trying to measure bubble up

810
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,439
um you put it in a much bigger vial in a

811
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:53,678
solid form

812
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,480
it goes into an oven gets shaking a

813
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,919
little bit

814
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,558
gases get liberated you've got a

815
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,400
partition coefficient you sample from it

816
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,319
and uh um you measure the gas is pretty

817
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,080
straightforward um most of your solvent

818
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,879
extracts that use solvent are made with

819
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,199
butane

820
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
or propane or a combination of butane

821
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,519
and propane

822
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,119
there's some people still out there

823
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,480
making extracts with kind of the heavier

824
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,558
hydrocarbons or

825
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,839
maybe alcohol but it's definitely very

826
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,519
few

827
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,879
so um mycotoxins that's another test

828
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,000
that's coming up and it was kind of

829
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,480
brought up um

830
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,240
in in kevin's kevin's talk and uh very

831
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,278
tough one also um with pesticides it's

832
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,480
hard enough to get through the matrix

833
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,000
effects but when you when you're looking

834
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,960
kind of a couple orders of magnitude

835
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,720
more sensitive for mycotoxins um it's

836
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,519
definitely a challenge and it requires

837
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,079
pretty

838
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,359
pretty um expensive mass specs that can

839
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,798
they can go really low and a lot of

840
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,038
sample cleanup

841
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,918
um that's what that talks about so yeah

842
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,440

843
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,038
um sorry i kind of hurry through that

844
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,360
but uh yeah that's the testing industry

845
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:49,038
so

846
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,798
it's definitely been an evolution in the

847
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,359
testing industry it has gotten better

848
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:53,038
