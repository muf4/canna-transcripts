1
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,279
uh hello thanks for coming to the

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,240
meeting I will try in the next few

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:17,879
minutes to uh present an overall view of

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,879
cannabinoid research as has been done in

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:23,839
my laboratory and in many other

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:27,038
Laboratories as well over the last uh uh

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,118
decade uh when we started work actually

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,400
in the

9
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,439
1960s there was essentially no uh major

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,600
interest as a matter of fact I asked for

11
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,878
a grant and I was told when you have

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,120
something more relevant to what's going

13
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:45,718
on uh contact us well it turned out that

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:48,479
cannabis was relevant and indeed uh over

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,800
the last few years it has become so

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:55,799
relevant that uh most of the major

17
00:00:51,799 --> 00:01:00,000
journals have uh uh numerous articles

18
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:03,959
and reviews this nature uh last year had

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,680
four reviews on uh uh cannabinoids and

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,400
the reason for that is that um

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,680
cannabinoids various cannabinoids have

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,359
turned out to be of uh major interest in

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:22,960
many diseases as a matter of fact a few

24
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:26,000
uh two researchers at NIH Dr kunos and

25
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,879
Dr Baka uh wrote a review in which they

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,840
mentioned that

27
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:35,519
cannabinoids the cannabinoid syst system

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,000
is involved in most human diseases now

29
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,798
this is a very strong statement but it

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,040
seems to be correct and they give a lot

31
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:48,079
of examples so and uh that's probably uh

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,240
the major reason why so many people so

33
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:55,279
many journals so many uh companies are

34
00:01:51,239 --> 00:02:01,000
interested in cannabinoids today but let

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:04,159
me start back uh canab noids as uh

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,478
medicine cannabinoids as drugs have been

37
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,400
used for thousands of years in Assyria

38
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:13,439
they were used apparently for

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,840
neurological diseases but over the years

40
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,759
it was used uh in many other ways Queen

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,598
Victoria for

42
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:26,159
example uh had cannabis brought to her

43
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:30,919
from India for the migraines she uh she

44
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:33,959
suffered from and this went on for

45
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:36,799
thousand a few thousand years until

46
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,360
because of legal reasons cannabis was

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
taken off the various

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,480
phopas

49
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:49,199
well actually ER nowadays it is coming

50
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,598
back and this is due to a large extent

51
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,119
to the research being done over many

52
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:58,359
many uh years now by many many groups

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,120
and a few uh companies as well now let

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,920
me try to

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,080
uh tell you where we stand today I

56
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,479
believe that we have passed through

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,319
three stages of cannabinoid

58
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:17,000
research uh the research in the 60s and

59
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:21,560
70s at least in our Laboratories was

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,560
mostly on the plant cannabinoids

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:30,120
surprisingly uh the major uh active

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,680
cannaboid psychoactive cannaboid

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,840
had not been isolated in pure form uh

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,319
although some

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,878
very good groups both in the US and the

66
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:46,238
UK had worked in it and this is due to

67
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:49,479
the huge mixture of compounds that were

68
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,239
uh that today we know are present in

69
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:55,679
cannabis uh it was difficult at that

70
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,920
time to isolate pure compound from such

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,480
a mixture well in the 60s we were able

72
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,199
to isolate

73
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,438
the active psychoactive material Delta

74
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,639
98c and

75
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:13,598
to identify it to elucidate it structure

76
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,839
and L synthesiz it now this compound of

77
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,599
course has been the object of thousands

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,560
of papers but there are also uh many

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:26,600
additional compounds we isolated about

80
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,600
um a dozen and here are some uh of the

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,639
compounds you can see on the slide and

82
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,800
there are quite a few others today we

83
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,478
know that there are about uh

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,120
120 natural plant cannabinoids most of

85
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:44,439
them present in very small amounts the

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,038
major compounds are uh as I said THC

87
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:50,319
tetrah hydroc canabo and cannabidoil

88
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:54,000
which is not

89
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:59,959
psychoactive uh but

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,199
actually uh neither THC no CBD

91
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:10,000
are uh produced by the plant the plant

92
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:13,400
produces uh cannabidiolic acid and THC

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,639
acid which you can see uh on the next

94
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:23,959
slide and uh these compounds DEC

95
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:27,600
carboxilate and form CBD and THC well

96
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:30,198
they are still on the plant or in the

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,319
Cannabis mixture which has been

98
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,000
extracted so as these two compounds are

99
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,439
not stable very little work has been

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,199
done recently uh we were able to

101
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:46,399
stabilize these compounds by making them

102
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:50,478
into their metyl Esters and we found

103
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:53,478
that these compounds are actually pretty

104
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:57,000
potent compounds in collaboration with

105
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,639
the colleagues in uh in the U UK in

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,079
Canada in

107
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,240
Italy in the US we found that uh these

108
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,879
compounds are anti-anxiety compounds we

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,000
found that these compounds uh lower uh

110
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,759
nausea and vomiting and I believe that

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,399
these compounds will be

112
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:22,840
investigated further over many years now

113
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:26,918
before I go ahead with the plant

114
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:30,679
cannabinoids I want to mention uh that

115
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:35,038
the activities actually

116
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:38,160
not the same in all extracts which seem

117
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:41,439
to have the same amount of the

118
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,880
psychoactive material of THC because

119
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:47,959
some of the compounds present in the

120
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:51,399
mixture uh affect

121
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:54,758
the effects that being uh that we see

122
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:58,439
from THC and this we call Anto Raj

123
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,720
effect it's some of the effects of uh

124
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,918
THC

125
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,080
are affected by uh the other unto Rush

126
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:11,318
compounds but not all effects are so so

127
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:15,279
we have to uh

128
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:19,319
undertake uh or to go ahead with a lot

129
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:24,359
of research in order to find out where

130
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:28,520
and how the anage effect uh uh works but

131
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,280
let's go and U ER look at the effects of

132
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:35,120
THC which are well knowns I will not go

133
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,679
into details we know that THC and in

134
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,918
addition to its

135
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:45,038
psychoactivity uh blocks uh uh vomiting

136
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:47,918
blocks Nosa we know that it is uh a

137
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:52,038
quite effective in treating post-trauma

138
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:55,120
patients particularly in um letting them

139
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:59,918
sleep better post- truma patients have

140
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,439
many problems sleeping and so uh quite a

141
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,399
few other effects and that's one of the

142
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:10,158
reasons why people use

143
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:12,079
THC in the canab Cannabis mixture but

144
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:15,719
over the last few years it has been

145
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:20,478
found that the med uh the medicinal

146
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,479
value of cannabis is probably mostly due

147
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,240
to cannaby

148
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:28,800
dial a compound which was isolated in

149
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,360
the 30s we elucidated its structure in

150
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,080
the 60s

151
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,680
and looked at some of its

152
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,240
pharmacological some of its clinical

153
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:41,359
effects and over the last decade there

154
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,839
has been a huge amount of work on canopy

155
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,800
dial and we seem to know quite a bit on

156
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:52,680
it and I'll just mention a few of the uh

157
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:55,879
effects that we know about the canopy di

158
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,719
uh one of the first effects we looked at

159
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,120
was the effect of canab dial and

160
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,079
epilepsy this was done in collaboration

161
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,240
with a South American group we first of

162
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:08,599
course looked into uh models of epilepsy

163
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,039
in animals we so that it is very

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,000
effective and then we did a clinical

165
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,838
trial and that was 35 years ago and we

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,360
found that uh in adult patients about 12

167
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:24,240
adult patients we had uh in a double

168
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:27,560
blind study we show that it is very

169
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,240
effective in patients that were treated

170
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:34,879
with anti-epileptic drugs but they were

171
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,879
not showing any Improvement and we found

172
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:41,320
that in four of the eight patients that

173
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:44,439
got uh canaby dial and they had no

174
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,640
attacks whatsoever for a few months

175
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:52,519
three of them had just a few and only

176
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:56,720
one was not affected unfortunately these

177
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:59,480
results did were not uh uh taken up by

178
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,959
the medical profession and for nearly 30

179
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,440
years uh nothing happened a lot of

180
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:10,599
people a lot of children could have been

181
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:14,800
helped but uh uh they had to wait until

182
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,800
uh many parents found that cannabis with

183
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:22,439
a lot of canab dial helps their children

184
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:25,759
and uh I'm glad to see the today uh

185
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,360
compound uh mixture an extract from

186
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:31,600
Cannabis which

187
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:35,839
contains essentially only canabal epidox

188
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:41,320
has been tested uh in epileptic children

189
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:45,880
and uh the results show that our uh

190
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:50,278
small trial 35 years ago was correct and

191
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:52,519
that canab dial helps uh in epilepsy in

192
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:53,278
Israel there are about a 100 children

193
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:58,000
that

194
00:10:53,278 --> 00:11:02,439
get a canab dial actually a mixture of

195
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,720
canab dial and HC in a ratio of 20 to1

196
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:10,160
and they are helped by uh by this

197
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,639
extract uh can epilepsy as you know may

198
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:16,159
be a terrible disease especially in

199
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:20,278
children uh and it may stop their

200
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:24,559
development and uh uh it ruins the child

201
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:26,759
it it may ruin the family uh another uh

202
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:31,359
aspect that has been looked into in

203
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:34,559
Israel is graft versus disease this is a

204
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,519
kind of an autoimmune disease namely if

205
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:40,638
the bone marrow uh in cancer patients

206
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,200
has to be replaced by uh bone marrow

207
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,720
from outside the body attacks the bone

208
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,320
marrow the bone marrow attacks the body

209
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:53,000
and the person may

210
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,600
be quite ill well it was found by a uh

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,799
group of uh clinicians in one of the

212
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:05,159
hospitals in Israel that uh canab dial

213
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:08,319
can lower prevent help with uh uh graft

214
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:11,039
versus hose disease and this is now

215
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,000
being developed by uh a commercial

216
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:18,159
company I hope that it will become a uh

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,240
a drug uh against uh grav versus hose

218
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:25,278
disease in the next few years um there

219
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,720
quite a few

220
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:31,198
other uh cannabis uh uh

221
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,120
there are quite a few other diseases

222
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:39,159
that canab be di or helps most of them

223
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:44,039
are still in the preclinical stage uh

224
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:49,519
they are for example uh quite a

225
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:52,879
few uh diseases in which the body

226
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,078
attacks itself aimmune diseases for

227
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,600
example Diabetes Type 1 we found that in

228
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,239
a model which is quite relevant to the

229
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,079
human disase disase we found that uh

230
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,639
canab dial is very helpful in diabetes

231
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:10,759
type one this is a disease in which the

232
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,440
body attacks the cells that produce

233
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:18,639
insulin and the body uh does not have

234
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:21,600
enough of uh insulin and is usually one

235
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,399
sees that in uh children starting with

236
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,560
children and we found that canab di is

237
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,639
very potent unfortunately nobody has

238
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,359
tried this on human

239
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,000
patients

240
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,519
um

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
now this was

242
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:45,078
essentially um a summary a few words on

243
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,039
the work that was done on uh the plant

244
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:53,039
cannabinoids but since then uh research

245
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:55,879
has moved into a second

246
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,559
Direction the plant cannabinoids were

247
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:02,039
thoroughly investigated for nearly 20

248
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,638
years from the 60s till the end 80s and

249
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:07,439
we got to know a lot about their

250
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,680
chemistry pharmacology physiology one

251
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,279
thing was not known and it was the mode

252
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:18,159
of action and in the

253
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:23,399
80s a group in 10 Lewis uh howlet Dr

254
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:26,600
howlet found that uh there is a receptor

255
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:30,720
a specific receptor for the

256
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:34,120
cannabinoids and uh this is the main

257
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,360
mode of action of cannabinoids or

258
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,919
particularly of THC acting through a

259
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,720
receptor and she called this receptor

260
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:45,120
cannabinoid receptor number one and

261
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,079
later a second receptor was found the

262
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,639
first receptor cannabinoid receptor

263
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:56,078
number one or CB1 causes uh uh the

264
00:14:52,639 --> 00:15:00,120
well-known effects of cannabis uh the

265
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:04,120
stimulation of CB2 does do not cause all

266
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:08,078
these effects actually it is a kind of a

267
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:11,320
immune uh mode of action it helps the

268
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:16,519
immune system in various

269
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:19,320
ways and THC binds to both CB1 and CB2

270
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:23,759
cannabid does not bind essentially to

271
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,920
either CB1 or CB2 now recepts don't

272
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,440
exist in our body

273
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,078
because

274
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,800
they uh

275
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:37,919
uh have to be activated by plant

276
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:42,519
material they exist because uh they have

277
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:46,240
to be stimulated or suppressed by

278
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:49,039
compounds that we produce so in the 80s

279
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,399
late ' 80s early '90s we started looking

280
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,879
for the endogenous

281
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,639
compounds uh that stimulate these

282
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,399
receptors and indeed in 1992 and then in

283
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,799
1995

284
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:06,318
we found two endogenous compounds made

285
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:09,679
in our body in the brain and the

286
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:11,838
periphery and these compounds we called

287
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,919
anandamide one of them and the other one

288
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:20,079
is called 2 a these compounds are

289
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:24,559
chemically completely different from the

290
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:28,159
the plant material although they act

291
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:30,719
essentially in the same way as THC

292
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,799
except that there

293
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,920
are uh there are enzymes in the body

294
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:42,359
that uh break them down as soon as they

295
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:45,278
have active uh acted so while THC stays

296
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,440
for quite some time in the body these

297
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:54,159
compounds are formed when and where

298
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:58,959
needed and then they uh uh broken down

299
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:01,039
so we do not see the many of the effects

300
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,678
that we know with

301
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:07,279
THC I will not speak about the uh

302
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,400
biochemistry of these compounds except

303
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:13,959
for one thing as I said they are not in

304
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:18,480
the body until they are needed they're

305
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:22,519
formed when needed then they pass from

306
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,120
one part of the syapse to the other part

307
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:29,400
of the cups and they they activate the

308
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:34,279
receptor and affect

309
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:37,519
the uh uh production or affect

310
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:39,678
the action of many of the

311
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,319
neurotransmitters that we know and this

312
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,120
is one of the modes of action of these

313
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:49,720
compounds but in addition they have uh

314
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:53,959
actions of their own now this is the

315
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:57,480
second stage of cannaboid research as I

316
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:00,919
see it there has been a lot of work on

317
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,960
anandamide as a new neurotransmitter

318
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:08,000
there has been a lot of work on 2 a and

319
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,480
together with a collaborator at Hebrew

320
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,720
University Professor EST shami we looked

321
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:21,279
at the effect of 2ag in brain trauma we

322
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:26,880
saw that in brain trauma 2

323
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:29,200
AG uh goes up its concentration goes up

324
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,919
tremendously so we thought is that

325
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,080
because the brain has been damaged and

326
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:41,640
does things that are not needed or it is

327
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:45,279
an actual a a reaction of the brain to

328
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:50,120
the trauma trying to lower uh the effect

329
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:53,839
of the trauma and indeed uh we caused uh

330
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:58,519
damage to to mice to the brain of mice

331
00:18:53,839 --> 00:19:02,359
and we looked at the effects of a 2 Ag

332
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:05,359
and we found that 2ag indeed lowers the

333
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:09,479
effects of the trauma and this is

334
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:11,558
probably one of the main reasons for its

335
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,839
production after the

336
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:18,839
trauma uh these compounds have a lot of

337
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,839
other effects and I will try to say a

338
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:24,959
few words about them it has been found

339
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:29,240
for example that stimulation of

340
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,919
CB2 has uh very positive effects

341
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:36,400
in uh

342
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,559
uh diseases of the heart in

343
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,080
atherosclerosis

344
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:44,879
in quite a lot of effects that have to

345
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:48,319
do with inflammation rheumatoid thritis

346
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,960
for example uh it has been found to

347
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:55,879
affect neurodegenerative diseases and of

348
00:19:51,960 --> 00:20:02,079
course as we well know uh it has effects

349
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:04,440
on pain um surprise inly uh these uh

350
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:09,199
effects have not been looked thoroughly

351
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:12,120
in human patients with pure 2 a or

352
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,600
compounds that act under the CB2

353
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:18,199
receptor alone although as I said

354
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,279
previously the CB1 receptor has to do

355
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,440
with the psycho activity quite a few

356
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,798
other things but it has to do with the

357
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,558
psychoactivity the CB2 does not have to

358
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:30,679
do anything with the psycho activity so

359
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:35,759
we can have and opening to new drugs

360
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:38,240
drugs that act on the CB2 alone and

361
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,720
although such compounds are are well

362
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,000
known we have synthesized several of

363
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,960
these quite a few of us are well known

364
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,200
they have not been introduced in in the

365
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,798
clinical practice I really have no idea

366
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,840
why because here we have an opening

367
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:58,839
these compounds are normally not toxic

368
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,158
they have very positive effects and I

369
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:05,119
hope that within the next few years uh

370
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:09,320
we shall see drugs based on specific

371
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:12,719
activity on CB2 and I'm aware that uh uh

372
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:14,359
a few companies are working on specific

373
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,519
CB2

374
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:25,038
agonists now uh I want to go to the

375
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:29,278
third stage of

376
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:33,640
activity uh we found that some of the

377
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:37,159
actions of uh cannabis

378
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:42,799
extracts cannot be

379
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:46,320
uh fully explained by uh the plant

380
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:50,639
cannabinoids and so we thought that

381
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:54,639
maybe there are additional compounds

382
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,799
present in the plant present in our body

383
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,919
that uh uh have to do with the medical

384
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:06,200
effects or the clinical effects we are

385
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:11,559
seeing in in mice so one of the effects

386
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:15,880
that we looked into was Vaso dilation we

387
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:19,720
know that um on brain trauma some of the

388
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,880
blood vessels are V restricted not

389
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:29,000
enough blood goes to some places in the

390
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:32,520
brain and cannabis definitely affects uh

391
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,720
this Vaso constriction but it could not

392
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:42,119
be explained fully with

393
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:45,159
uh uh anandamide and 2 a so we went

394
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:48,278
ahead looking for a compound of

395
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,480
compounds that act on this vasod

396
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:56,798
dilation and indeed we discovered that a

397
00:22:51,480 --> 00:23:02,360
compound very closely related to uh an

398
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:05,798
emite uh acts and causes uh affect the

399
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:10,879
vasil constriction and it is a vasil

400
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:13,839
dilator and the compound is really uh

401
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,880
essentially of the same type as an

402
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:21,359
andite anandamide is a fatty acid called

403
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,400
arachidonic acid bound to ethanolamide

404
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:29,479
here we have arachidonic acid bound to

405
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:32,200
an amino acid and um so we went ahead

406
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,919
looking for activity of this type of

407
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:40,480
compounds and this I believe is now the

408
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:44,360
third stage of cannabinoid research our

409
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:48,640
body produces more than 100 compounds of

410
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:51,278
this Sal fatty acids bound to an amino

411
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,400
acid now these

412
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,359
compounds uh we know very little about

413
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,440
their

414
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:01,158
activity uh I don't believe that the

415
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,480
body synthesizes them uh just for the

416
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:07,799
fun of it most probably it has something

417
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,519
to do with specific effects in the body

418
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:15,720
so we went ahead looking for the

419
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:18,720
activity of these compounds and uh these

420
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,519
uh um re

421
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,480
research uh This research was always

422
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:29,319
done in collaboration with

423
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:34,240
biologist and in specific Fields um

424
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:39,759
one effect which we found to be uh due

425
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:43,839
to compounds close to an emite is bone

426
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:47,158
remodeling it was well known that women

427
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,519
in the Mediterranean region have less

428
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,760
osteoporosis than women in northern

429
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:55,240
Europe for

430
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:59,158
example and uh the suggestion was made

431
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:02,960
that olive oil has to do with that

432
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:06,399
women uh in the Mediterranean region

433
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,200
consume more olive oil than women in

434
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:13,959
northern Europe in in in the food there

435
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,440
is a lot of uh olive oil being used uh

436
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,919
in in Israel and all the countries

437
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,200
around the Mediterranean region and is

438
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,840
it possible people said that it is the

439
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:29,240
olol that has to do with um uh with

440
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,439
the lower

441
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:37,359
uh osteoporosis that we see so we went

442
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:40,080
ahead looking uh for a the compound that

443
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,359
causes this effect and this was done in

444
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:47,038
collaboration with the late professor

445
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:50,959
Bob who did all the uh work on uh both

446
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:55,038
in vitro and in animals and um we found

447
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:58,720
that there is a compound produced uh uh

448
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,839
in the body and which is closely related

449
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,558
to uh an

450
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:10,398
andite uh this compound is uh indeed a

451
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:14,558
derivative of oleic acid and uh when

452
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:17,839
administ we isolated the uh found a

453
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:22,599
structure synthesize it and when this

454
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:26,599
compound was administered to uh mice

455
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:30,199
that had osteoporosis and we could uh we

456
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:34,359
had a model for osteoporosis in mice we

457
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:37,080
found that yes indeed it helps build the

458
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:42,119
bones back

459
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:46,278
uh you can see uh in the slide that um

460
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:50,439
I'm showing at the present that um uh a

461
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:54,119
few months after

462
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,759
uh under certain conditions might

463
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:59,000
develop osteoporosis and you can see

464
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:03,200
that in the red

465
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,159
on the slide we start giving them uh the

466
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:11,278
compound we found uh o serin we found

467
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,120
that this compound not only blocks

468
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:19,759
further destruction but it also B uh

469
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:26,599
helps with uh the bones being formed

470
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:29,158
again now this uh this effect may have

471
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:32,480
very very uh

472
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:36,840
High clinical importance and indeed a

473
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:41,079
company is uh developing a compound uh

474
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:43,319
based on oil serin a derivative and I

475
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:47,240
hope that it will become a drug within

476
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:51,918
the next few years over the last few

477
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:55,599
months we have been working on addiction

478
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,840
we means a group of uh

479
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:02,918
four uh research groups in addition to

480
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:07,079
ours a group in Richmond Virginia a

481
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:09,720
group in Canada and a group in Italy uh

482
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:12,960
we sat together at one of the meetings

483
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,079
discussed the possibility that addiction

484
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,440
being a

485
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:20,759
disease which causes changes in our body

486
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:25,440
in our brain this disease

487
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:28,879
probably uh can be treated after all our

488
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,320
body tries to prevent the disease our

489
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:37,799
body tries to fight against disease is

490
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:41,839
it possible that uh uh in addiction our

491
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:45,960
body tries to prevent addiction tries to

492
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:48,678
lower the effects of addiction well ER

493
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,880
the answer is yes we believe that this

494
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:55,919
is definitely so there was a

495
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:58,840
publication uh that a person who is

496
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:03,919
strongly addicted to uh smoking

497
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:06,278
cigarettes to nicotine uh when he was

498
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,399
involved in a traffic accident that

499
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:13,599
caused damage to a certain part of his

500
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:15,678
brain uh he stopped being addicted so we

501
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:19,839
thought that this is a good starting

502
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:24,919
point to see how we can uh affect

503
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:28,879
addiction and uh we tried this in mice

504
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:31,240
we took mice caused damage to that

505
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,640
particular part of the brain insula

506
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,839
called and we looked at the changes

507
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,519
taking place there in the insula and we

508
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:43,839
found that the insula after damage

509
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,240
starts producing a compound and Nite

510
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,639
related

511
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,960
compound uh which uh it was possible to

512
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,600
isolate

513
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,278
identify uh elucidated the structure and

514
00:29:53,599 --> 00:30:00,798
synthesized it turned out to be oil

515
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:04,440
glycine again a fatty acid bound to an

516
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:10,558
amino acid very closely related to an

517
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:15,038
emide so this compound oil gine was

518
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:18,678
administered to a mice and it

519
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,119
prevented uh addiction to mice and it

520
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:25,080
prevented

521
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:26,319
withdrawal uh withdraw symptoms of uh uh

522
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:28,558
both

523
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:32,200
nicotine uh

524
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,359
addiction and opiate addiction again in

525
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,480
mice it did not

526
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:44,439
prevent uh the addiction to formation of

527
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:49,519
addiction to uh heroin or to Morphine so

528
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:53,880
we know now there different types of uh

529
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:56,599
different ways our body uh reacts to

530
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,720
addictions and so we have to look for

531
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:01,199
maybe additional compounds

532
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,278
that will act on cocaine addiction or

533
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,360
that may act on opiate addiction but

534
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:08,720
here we know for the first time I

535
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:12,038
believe that there are compounds formed

536
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,278
in our body which work in this case at

537
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,158
least

538
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:21,119
against

539
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,799
uh nicotine addiction so we believe that

540
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,439
many of the other compounds that are

541
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,679
found of the same type uh many of the

542
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,278
other compounds have activities and we

543
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,480
have to find out what these activities

544
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:36,440
are well thank you very much I would

545
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,839
like to summarize what I said in a few

546
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,880
words first research on

547
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,158
cannabinoids uh was obviously on the

548
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:50,399
plant cannabinoids we learned a lot

549
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:54,200
about uh uh THC cannabid dial and the

550
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:57,239
acids the second stage was on the

551
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:01,519
endogenous cannabinoids anandamide and

552
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:06,359
2ag which are of major importance in our

553
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:10,558
metabolism and in probably the effect

554
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:14,119
our body or the way our body tries to

555
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:17,599
lower or prevent uh disease and the

556
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:21,239
third phase is the formation of our in

557
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:25,359
our body of a huge number of compounds

558
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,720
many of which seem to be uh of major

559
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:31,879
importance in various diseases

560
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,960
I hope that we shall continue research

561
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,320
on the canab noise and I'm glad to see

562
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,440
that so many people are interested in

563
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:41,439
this field thank you
