knowledge with me

68

in our conversation topics will be hit

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,719
on include

70
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,199
how the entourage effect includes more

71
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,359
than just cannabinoids and terpenes

72
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,159
how plant-based medicines differ from

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,480
single molecule pharmaceuticals

74
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,039
how plants use terpenes to communicate

75
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,959
with each other how high levels of

76
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,199
terpenes can be toxic

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
how a plant's responses to environmental

78
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,878
stresses

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,599
can change their medicinal effects how

80
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,439
at-home

81
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,039
extraction techniques compare to

82
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,519
commercial processes

83
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,479
and much more before we get to that

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,879

good afternoon ben thanks for having me

it's great to be here

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,519
absolutely and i'm really excited to

128
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,240
talk with you today

129
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,959
um about a topic that we've sort of

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
touched on

131
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,279
in prior podcasts with uh dr russo and

132
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,959
dr goldstein

133
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,079
um this whole idea of the entourage

134
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,839
effect um in those other podcasts we did

135
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,359
talk a lot about the endocannabinoid

136
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,719
system and

137
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
and how cannabinoids can affect the

138
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,240
human body but i know that there are a

139
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,279
lot of other compounds

140
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
in the cannabis plant that many

141
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,959
researchers

142
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,759
believe having an additional medicinal

143
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,279
effect

144
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
and so i really wanted to explore that

145
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,679
topic with you mainly because

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,478
i reviewed your presentation that you

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,199
gave at kmid 2019 as part of the cme

148
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,240
course

149
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,319
where you gave a great overview

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
of the entourage effect in terpenes

151
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,639
specifically

152
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,360
and i was really excited to

153
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,879
bring that to the podcast audience so

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,160
first i'd like to start with the basics

155
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,800
and perhaps you could give us

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,039
a bit of an overview on the major types

157
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
of compounds that we've found in the

158
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,240
cannabis plant

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,600
and then perhaps we can dive into a

160
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,400
little bit more detail in each one

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,080
sure well yeah let's let's start with

162
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,560
that overview in terms of chemistry

163
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,399
and and i just want to say as we as we

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,680
dive into chemistry here

165
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,959
um looking at plants it's really

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,519
important that we

167
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,239
you know there's a common adage that you

168
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,719
know what

169
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,519
when you're doing pharmacology with

170
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,199
plants

171
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,240
you're looking for a a gem in a jungle

172
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,720
and i think that's really a

173
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,400
misunderstanding of

174
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,600
plant chemistry and plant physiological

175
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,079
activity in general because really

176
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
plants are loaded with uh thousands of

177
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,279
compounds literally thousands now i know

178
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,799
i know what the current number is for

179
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,758
cannabis is somewhere around four to

180
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,240
five hundred

181
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,160
but i can assure you that that number is

182
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,360
uh grossly understated

183
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,960
if we look at for example wheat and corn

184
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,160
we've got about three thousand to five

185
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,159
thousand constituents

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,800
in either one of those respectively

187
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
there and

188
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
that should make us think those are the

189
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
most steady plants on the planet because

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,759
of their

191
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,519
importance to human diet but that should

192
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,598
make us think that these aren't unusual

193
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,159
plants that all plants are going to have

194
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,839
let's say at least a thousand compounds

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
in them and probably closer to three to

196
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,119
five thousand

197
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
and so when we get to cannabis or any

198
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,639
other medicinal plant

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,319
we really have to acknowledge that there

200
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,918
are a lot of common constituents in

201
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,720
there for example some of the flavonoids

202
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,478
such as

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,880
quercetin and camphoral that are already

204
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,758
known to be physiologically active

205
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,000
but in in pharmacology labs they get

206
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,680
ignored because they're common

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,639
and so we already know for example

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,280
quercetin hits a very key site called

209
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,038
cert six inside the nucleus of the cell

210
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,079
which has profound implications for

211
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,120
human health

212
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,598
on the positive side and

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,280
you know so so when we get to cannabis

214
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,279
we're looking at flavonoids that

215
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,559
really some people have talked about

216
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,839
some researchers are looking at but

217
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
nobody's really looking at

218
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,918
in a depth that i'd like to see and

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,918
still the cannabis community hasn't

220
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,719
caught up with that so the canflaven a

221
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,079
b and c are a particular interest we're

222
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,960
looking at stillbinois

223
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,318
which um a famous stillbinoid that

224
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,799
everybody seems to know in the natural

225
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,800
products industry is resveratrol

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,000
not to be saying that there's

227
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,879
resveratrol on cannabis there's not

228
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,879
but there are stillbinoids from that

229
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,080
same class of compounds that resveratrol

230
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,759
belongs to

231
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,598
in cannabis and they're of great

232
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,959
interest too and and there was a study

233
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,598
in the last uh

234
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,158
two years i think that just really laid

235
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,839
out

236
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,000
further stillbinois there are only a few

237
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,159
known cannabis and now there's

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
there's uh at least a half a dozen that

239
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,278
are known

240
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
um and then we get into the spermadine

241
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,399
alkaloids i mean we can we can keep

242
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,599
going and the root right

243
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,639
the freelance the epiphytolin

244
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,480
there's lots of compounds that we need

245
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,080
to be talking about that are known to be

246
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
physiologically active

247
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
and yet we're still stuck on

248
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,160
cannabinoids and terpenes

249
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,000
not that there's not a lot to like there

250
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:10,000
but we're still stuck there

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,519
yeah and i'll admit some of those are

252
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,519
new to me

253
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,278
um very much familiar of course with the

254
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,399
cannabinoids and

255
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:21,039
you know thc cbd and you know their

256
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,120
their acid versions as well and terpenes

257
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,079
as well but stillbinoids um that's a new

258
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
one for me

259
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,600
um i'm interested a little bit more to

260
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,480
learning a bit more about that

261
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,360
sure so stillbinoids have been shown to

262
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,240
be anti-cancer anti-inflammatory

263
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,120
as well as some other comp uh some other

264
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,720
pharmacological activities depending on

265
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,679
which stillbinoid we're talking about

266
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,200
but they're of great interest

267
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,159
and in terms of you know a person that's

268
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,399
aging or

269
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,240
an ill person or a person that just

270
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,639
wants to enhance their health

271
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,360
um there's a few stillbinoids that are

272
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,319
well known

273
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,959
in the natural products industry that

274
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,879
are

275
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,278
of great importance for example coming

276
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,399
back to resveratrol and again this isn't

277
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,720
in cannabis but

278
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,000
it's possible we may find similar

279
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,000
activity

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
um from some of the stillbinoids of

281
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
cannabis you know resveratrol

282
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,278
hits a a target called cert one in the

283
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,440
nucleus

284
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,039
and certain one is known for longevity

285
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,399
like uh

286
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,639
david sinclair sold his research to

287
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,480
i forget which pharma company was it

288
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,360
might have been pfizer

289
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,480
for a billion dollars a billion dollars

290
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,839
because

291
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,440
of course longevity is the is

292
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,160
is the uh the human goal here i guess

293
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,399
um even in these crazy times people

294
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:48,559
still seem to want to live through

295
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,559
so yeah there's there's lots to know

296
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,239
there um but but coming to

297
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,000
you know coming to the entourage effect

298
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,959
so really the question

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,639
that we're really asking here

300
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,399
understated question

301
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,679
the the underlying question is

302
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,480
is isolated thc or isolated cbd or even

303
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,838
a mixture of the

304
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,039
of the two the same as taking a

305
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:16,320
a aliquot or a

306
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,078
sample or a mouthful of cannabis

307
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,320
and i think most people in the cannabis

308
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,719
industry would scream no it's not

309
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,000
and as i would too but the problem is

310
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,800
pharmacologically a lot of those people

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,159
in that

312
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:32,078
side of things are saying yeah well

313
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,838
you know let's get rid of all of all the

314
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,559
stuff and just get to the

315
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,279
active compound and this is a misnomer

316
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,278
in general

317
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,838
if if we look at the idea of active

318
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,720
compounds

319
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,079
um there's really no clear scientific

320
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,440
rationale

321
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:52,399
that's been stated very well

322
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,959
to argue that uh plant medicine should

323
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,320
be reduced to the reactive constituent

324
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:01,199
this was a really an artifact of

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,160
modern research that started doing this

326
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
and

327
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,319
the more and more we look at models like

328
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,839
network pharmacology

329
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,240
where we think about multiple

330
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,680
constituents

331
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,720
hitting hitting multiple targets in the

332
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,519
body

333
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,600
in other words hitting different parts

334
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,000
of a cellular network

335
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,519
or a physiological network so whether

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,480
we're talking tissues whether we're

337
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,039
talking

338
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,759
cellular receptors whether we're talking

339
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,480
enzymes whether we're talking

340
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,559
inside the nucleus and tweaking

341
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,519
transcription factors

342
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,000
you know hitting more than one might be

343
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,120
useful

344
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,360
and so this is what the network

345
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,360
pharmacology is showing is that

346
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,278
number one we have to we can reduce the

347
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,000
dose for example of thc

348
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,919
if we have other compounds that support

349
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,559
that activity

350
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,159
and number two we really need to think

351
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,039
about pharmacokinetics

352
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,559
so even if we just have an active

353
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,879
constituent

354
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,559
oftentimes that active constituent

355
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,679
getting into the body

356
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:08,078
getting past the gut is a huge issue and

357
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:11,278
in fact if you look at the data

358
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:14,399
um about one out of two every

359
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:18,399
new drugs uh new drug entities

360
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,958
um that are trying to make it into

361
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,480
uh into the shelf for for physicians to

362
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:26,799
be able to prescribe

363
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,720
fail due to poor pharmacokinetics but

364
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,639
now what do we mean by pharmacokinetics

365
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,079
essentially what we're talking about

366
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,159
is in this case specifically um

367
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,439
bioavailability no pharmacokinetics

368
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,198
involves much more than that but

369
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,399
bioavailability is key right

370
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:45,359
because if the compound can't get past

371
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,440
the gut then we've got a real issue in

372
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,079
fact it's all for naught right

373
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,120
and so if you really look at the way

374
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:55,120
that plants have handled this and let's

375
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,959
focus it let's do a pollenesque as in

376
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,799
michael pollan let's do a pollen-esque

377
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:02,000
perspective on this for a second

378
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,639
so plants produce these metabolites to

379
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,198
protect themselves right and so many of

380
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,198
these

381
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,439
metabolites that we would be consuming

382
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,879
are anti-fungals

383
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,000
uh um anti-feedings for herbivores so

384
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,439
that they don't feed on

385
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,039
a continual in anal plant or

386
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,720
anti-parasitic or antiviral

387
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,000
because a plant has got to protect

388
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,519
itself they wouldn't have made it

389
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,480
through hundreds of millions of years of

390
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,959
evolution

391
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,560
without some sort of protection in this

392
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,319
protection for plants since they can't

393
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,439
pull up their roots and run

394
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,120
is chemistry right and so

395
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,040
if the plant is going to deliver an

396
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,879
active compound if it's produced an

397
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,679
active compound that can protect it from

398
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,759
a predator of some sort

399
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,638
if it can't get past the membrane of the

400
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,838
predator if it can't get past that gut

401
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,680
then it's off or not it's it's wasted

402
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,880
its atp for nothing

403
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,120
thus it wouldn't have made it through

404
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,879
evolution so what plants do

405
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,560
is when you they deliver an active

406
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,919
compound you also get a bunch of other

407
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,278
stuff with that a bunch of other

408
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,479
phytochemicals

409
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:07,759
and those phytochemicals assist

410
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
in bioavailability and so when it comes

411
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,919
back to

412
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,000
pharma and we're looking at the fact

413
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,919
that they're isolating single compounds

414
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,440
throwing it on a capsule and hoping that

415
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,519
it gets past the gut

416
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,440
this is ridiculous because this is not

417
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,839
how evolution has designed it is

418
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,920
in essence you know evolutionarily

419
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,279
plants were selected to be able to

420
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,879
deliver these compounds

421
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,879
and the way they delivered them was not

422
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,078
by making the perfect molecule that was

423
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,879
pharmacokinetic

424
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,638
the appropriate it was by having other

425
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,439
adjuvant compounds

426
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,799
that supported the absorption of the

427
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,639
active compound

428
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,039
and so this is when we take a mouthful

429
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,039
of a plant this is what's happening

430
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,278
there's lots of actives in that mouthful

431
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,039
of plants but there's also lots of other

432
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,838
compounds that assist

433
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,639
in the absorption of the actives so i

434
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,160
think that's a real

435
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:59,198
key piece that people tend to miss

436
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,719
wow that's interesting and

437
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,879
yeah i think you're really hitting on a

438
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,839
point that that seems to be

439
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,000
seems to be playing out in more recent

440
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,360
canmed events is sort of this

441
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,679
this shift or maybe it's not a shift but

442
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
this

443
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,479
this move towards sort of more um

444
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,879
isolated compounds and to use it for

445
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
more

446
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,799
kind of specific uses um and there's a

447
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,560
lot of

448
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,559
people who are traditional more

449
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,799
traditionalists or

450
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,679
in the cannabis medicine space who are

451
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,278
very

452
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,359
much proponents of the whole plant

453
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,720
extract but i have to imagine that you

454
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,680
know there's there's trade-offs with

455
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,879
both

456
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,599
um mainly that as you said before

457
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,720
there's so many

458
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,560
unknown compounds in the plant

459
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
and there's also so much diversity

460
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,479
between plants

461
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,838
how can you really trust that you're

462
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,839
getting a consistent

463
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,839
medicine to patients

464
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,519
excellent question and this is the

465
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,959
concern right this is this is the

466
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,480
argument you get from the medical

467
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,479
community is well how do we know what's

468
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,278
in here how do we know how much

469
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,078
of each compound in it is in there and

470
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,318
unless you've done

471
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,918
something like gw pharma has done where

472
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,399
they're very careful

473
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,000
and they're cloning and so they're and

474
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,079
the environmental conditions are exactly

475
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,439
the same because they're growing indoor

476
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:20,720
then you you do get variability but

477
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,720
let's look back at hundreds of millions

478
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,838
of years of evolution and talk about

479
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
variability

480
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:28,798
variability isn't a disadvantage

481
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,240
variability can be an advantage

482
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,558
in that think about there's this concept

483
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,079
called

484
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:39,519
xeno hormesis and this idea is that

485
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,720
um plants respond to the environment by

486
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,879
upregulating

487
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
certain compounds or and or down

488
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,400
regulating other compounds

489
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,919
and in that response to the environment

490
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
they're adapting so

491
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,759
really when it comes down to thinking

492
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,678
about an organism surviving

493
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,359
even on an evolutionary level or even a

494
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,360
short-term level it's all about

495
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,678
adaptation

496
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,719
and so if we can have a situation where

497
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,360
the plant

498
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,360
is upregulating and downrigging certain

499
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,038
compounds that are support

500
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:12,719
important for its survival and then as

501
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:15,599
humans or as other mammals or even

502
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,640
you know other types of of animals

503
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,359
besides mammals

504
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
if they consume that then it could be

505
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,639
argued

506
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,399
that whatever was upregulated is

507
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,600
basically a signal

508
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,720
a signal to their biology that something

509
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,319
is potentially

510
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,440
changing in the environment and

511
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:36,240
therefore that signal can be used to up

512
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,320
regulate certain uh biological functions

513
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,720
that might help an organism survive

514
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,798
so that's this whole concept of

515
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,120
xenohormesis and so that variability can

516
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:49,038
actually be used as a plus

517
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:52,319
now jim duke who is a mentor of mine

518
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,919
dr jim duke um and fantastic

519
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,038
ethnobotanist

520
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,480
he used to say that the body would

521
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,200
mine the compounds that you swallowed in

522
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,880
a plant

523
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,240
it would go okay i need more of this i

524
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,039
don't need more of that we can slough

525
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,000
that off

526
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,960
in our in our waste product oh i need

527
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
this

528
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,640
oh just a little bit of that i've got

529
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
enough i got almost enough of that

530
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
and i think there's something there and

531
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,079
that's really as simple as that sound

532
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,919
that's really advanced science that we

533
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,159
haven't gotten to yet

534
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,440
um but i do think there's certainly the

535
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,640
potential

536
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,279
to regulate what comes in and what

537
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,400
what goes out in terms of our needs our

538
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,240
physiological needs

539
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,000
this is already well known for certain

540
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,839
vitamins for example vitamin c

541
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,519
we can have a situation where if we have

542
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,558
enough vitamin c we just

543
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,798
essentially uh slough it off in the gut

544
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,639
so in other words and this is well known

545
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,200
high doses of vitamin c will cause loose

546
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,960
stools

547
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
well what you're doing is eliminating

548
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,400
the vitamin c that you can't use

549
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,479
in a cancer patient that could use up to

550
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,160
40 grams a day of vitamin c depending on

551
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,120
what what exactly is going on in their

552
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
body

553
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,359
they're not going to they're not going

554
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
to lose that they're not going to get

555
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,599
diarrhea from high doses of vitamin c

556
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,240
so there's lots of ways to think about

557
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,000
this but we've been thinking really

558
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,919
in simplistic terms and that's because

559
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,599
honestly if you really look at our

560
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,919
science it's been limited to very

561
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,240
simplistic instrumentation

562
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,200
until very recently with the human

563
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,759
genome project we're seeing a huge

564
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,038
advancement and understanding real time

565
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,200
physiology

566
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,119
and what actually goes on we've had

567
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,440
these simple simplistic models where

568
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,239
we're drawing straight lines on graphs

569
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,279
and expecting that to reflect reality

570
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,279
and

571
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,558
nothing could be further from the truth

572
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,279
it's a frozen

573
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,918
snapshot in time that we're looking at

574
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,599
not

575
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,280
really what's going on in the body and

576
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,319
when we just look at one compound at a

577
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,399
time

578
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,240
and what it's doing we really don't have

579
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,480
a lot of information but if we can look

580
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,400
at

581
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,240
bunches of genes being upregulated or

582
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,080
downregulated at the same time

583
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,159
now we've got something closer to

584
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,599
reality closer to what happens

585
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,960
every time we swallow a bolus of

586
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,719
kale or broccoli right all kinds of

587
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
genes are being upregulated and down

588
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,720
regulated i saw a report recently for

589
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
reishi mushroom or rishi mushroom some

590
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,120
people say

591
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,038
ganoderma lucidum where they were

592
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,000
showing 400 genes

593
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,279
up regulated and about 20 to 30 being

594
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,759
down regulated

595
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,639
when you take reishi so this is what's

596
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,038
the reality

597
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,320
and when we use one compound at a time

598
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,879
this isn't happening

599
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,599
and i would argue that as old as a human

600
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,200
genome is 2.5 to 5 million years

601
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:37,599
depending on who you read

602
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,600
that we really do have a situation where

603
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:43,038
real time physiology is very incredibly

604
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:46,720
complex and active

605
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:50,158
and our simplistic portraits

606
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,480
of what really goes on is just

607
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,120
mind-boggling especially when we come

608
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,038
across as an air with an arrogance

609
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,879
saying oh we understand completely

610
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:59,919
what's going on mrs jones just take this

611
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,320
pill

612
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,600
um you know sorry to put it out there

613
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,319
but

614
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,359
it's it's rather shocking just how

615
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,599
simplistic we

616
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,719
have treated people's bodies and their

617
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:14,959
condition their uh

618
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:18,480
disease conditions i love that idea of

619
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,519
sort of the the body takes in a plant

620
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,360
and sort of has like a buffet

621
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,960
of different um compounds that it can

622
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,000
choose from and it picks and chooses

623
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,279
what what it needs

624
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,839
uh it's a really good it's a really good

625
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,000
visual

626
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,439
and i did want to go back to kind of

627
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,599
going back to the plant side

628
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,840
of sort of different environmental

629
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,918
conditions maybe upregulating

630
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,918
different processes and producing

631
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,559
certain whether it be flavonoids or

632
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,400
terpenes or things like that

633
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,079
it reminds me of conversations i've had

634
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,720
with folks who are on the

635
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,480
cannabis genomics side who are sort of

636
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,720
searching for the markers in the

637
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,839
cannabis genome to

638
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,919
um to find what genes are producing

639
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,879
these terpenes or flavonoids or

640
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,919
cannabinoids

641
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,080
and i wonder if sort of the solution is

642
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,840
kind of a combination approach of you

643
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,759
need the genetics but you also need to

644
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,000
maybe specialize the environment

645
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,158
to make it more suitable for producing

646
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,400
those sorts of compounds is that

647
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,159
that a fair thing to say well yeah

648
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,679
ultimately with xeno hormesis that's

649
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,640
what we're talking about we're talking

650
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,640
about

651
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,960
um the environment having changes in it

652
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,038
that upregulate or down regulate certain

653
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,720
enzymes or certain genes right

654
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,640
and so in in a scientific perspective

655
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,079
we would want to standardize that

656
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
environment so that we can understand

657
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,359
what was going on

658
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,400
in a certain environment but ultimately

659
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,479
what's going on

660
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,600
is that's what's happening constantly in

661
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,440
our environment

662
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,879
let's look at the fires you know i'm in

663
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,880
up in oregon where we just had to

664
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,520
evacuate

665
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,320
due to a fire that came through ashland

666
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,918
and and

667
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,079
headed into some small communities

668
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,720
destroyed 4 000 homes

669
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,240
but let's talk about the environment and

670
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,278
the smoke that was in the environment

671
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,798
all those crops

672
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,960
including all the cannabis that's grown

673
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:10,558
around here which is a fair amount

674
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:15,200
as well as all the hip now that

675
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:17,038
induced gene changes that induced

676
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,360
changes in the proteins that were being

677
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,119
expressed in terms of enzymes and

678
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,038
receptors in the plant

679
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,399
and therefore the chemistry had just

680
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:28,319
changed

681
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,440
and so could it be

682
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:35,678
that by consuming those plants

683
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,080
that it might make an organism more fit

684
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,679
to survive smoked environments and

685
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,918
that's that's the smoky environments

686
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,679
excuse me that's the xeno-hormesis model

687
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,200
right so yeah we need to know what's

688
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,240
being upregulated and out-regulated i'm

689
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,798
not putting down

690
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,798
you know science in the way that we need

691
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,558
to be able to standardize a condition

692
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,000
that's what gw's done to have the

693
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,200
perfect you know

694
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,640
remedy that's got just the amount of

695
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,278
other phytochemicals besides the

696
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,919
cannabinoids they want in it

697
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,480
but reality is for medicinal plants and

698
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,080
for people living in a certain area

699
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,079
and taking those medicinal plants in

700
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,000
that area there's probably a huge

701
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,240
advantage that we don't understand yet

702
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
because of the plants adapting to the

703
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,839
environment and therefore the humans

704
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,480
adapting from the plant's chemistry

705
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,240
to the environment wow so are you

706
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,640
essentially saying that

707
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,679
you know if uh maybe if a plant were

708
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,520
exposed to

709
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,080
high temperature or something like that

710
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,359
and it would it generated a response

711
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,519
that

712
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,879
consuming that plant you could

713
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,879
theoretically

714
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,360
get some sort of benefit in in your own

715
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,799
body to be resistant to that heat as

716
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,359
well

717
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,599
that's exactly what i'm saying that

718
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,519
that's the xeno hormesis model

719
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,038
and and there's probably places where

720
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,960
that model is weak and there's probably

721
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,038
places where that model is strong

722
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,120
so it may not be for all environmental

723
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,798
conditions but think it through in terms

724
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,959
of human uh existence and

725
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,200
and mammalian existence that lived on

726
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,079
plants you know the plants certainly

727
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,000
communicated

728
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,399
coming back to a pollen-esque model the

729
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,960
plants certainly were communicating with

730
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,080
with the species around them and that

731
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,240
communication was

732
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,918
probably more key than we think it is

733
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
because we don't have the technology yet

734
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,440
to understand it

735
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,319
if you look at a jungle situation and

736
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,240
you listen to the wildlife in a jungle

737
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:26,079
they talk to each other they may not

738
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,079
know exactly what those sounds

739
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,119
in terms of what kind of words they

740
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,759
would be in in the equivalent of human

741
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,719
language

742
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,798
but they know a warning sound right all

743
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,079
species can recognize a warning sound

744
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,639
from another species

745
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,079
provided they have lived together and so

746
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,440
that's exactly the same

747
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,678
same kind of model that this xeno

748
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,320
hormesis model is so cannabis

749
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,200
really has its potential all medicinal

750
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,599
plants have

751
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,400
all food plants have this potential for

752
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,678
warning us

753
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,640
uh of what's coming if we pay attention

754
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,240
and this is where when we're growing in

755
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,679
duplicate environments when we're trying

756
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,480
to recreate the environment

757
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,759
indoor um cannabis and i know you're

758
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,880
about to get a bunch of letters from

759
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,679
indoor growers now

760
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,960
but but indoor cannabis is exactly the

761
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,720
same environment and therefore the

762
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,240
chemistry is exactly the same the same

763
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
genes are being uprighted and down

764
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,120
regulated

765
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,918
and therefore the message is exactly the

766
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,519
same every time to the human consumer

767
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,278
that you could argue that that's a good

768
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,720
thing you could also argue that that's

769
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,038
not necessarily

770
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,839
for the good of the person in that

771
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,480
environment

772
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,480
taking that

773
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,640
yeah and one of the things that that

774
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,200
struck me when i watched that

775
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,000
that video from your lecture at kim in

776
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,319
2019 was this idea that

777
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,679
plants use terpenes to communicate with

778
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,558
each other i was wondering if you could

779
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,159
speak a bit more to that yeah sure so

780
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,158
the so the terpenes

781
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
as as tired as i am talking about

782
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,600
terpenes and cannabis

783
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,880
i have to be super honest they're still

784
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,918
really interesting and they're still

785
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,320
super active you know terpenes to me

786
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,320
are the closest thing we have to to

787
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,359
pharmaceutical strength

788
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:09,038
compounds in plants

789
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:10,639
they're highly active

790
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,119
to the point where they can easily be

791
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,399
toxic as well but

792
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:18,079
yeah terpenes they the way that plants

793
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,199
use terpenes because they're volatile

794
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,319
right by

795
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,319
you know if you look at the term

796
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,639
essential oils essential oils used to be

797
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,200
called

798
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,559
volatile excuse me

799
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,759
essential oils used to be called

800
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,440
volatile oils because their volatility

801
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,079
these compounds especially the

802
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,080
monoterpenes but also the sesquiterpenes

803
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,359
go off into the environment can float

804
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,439
off a leaf and

805
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,879
float over to the next plant in a

806
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,038
gaseous form

807
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,240
and tell that plant whatever that

808
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:49,359
message is right

809
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,679
oh oh dear something's coming that

810
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,479
that that deer that's chomping on me is

811
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,880
coming your way

812
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,319
up regulates some protective compounds

813
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,120
you know that's what's going on

814
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,879
or more robust growth that's been shown

815
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,479
as well you can get more robust growth

816
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,960
with with the right signaling in the

817
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,880
environment from different plants

818
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,000
an experiment was done years ago with

819
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,600
tannins

820
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,440
where they they took a particular herd

821
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,879
of a mammal i forget which herd it was

822
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,640
it was an antelope-like

823
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,679
animal excuse me it was an antelope-like

824
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,200
animal and they fenced it off inside

825
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,640
this region

826
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,399
because i wanted to study these trees

827
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,440
that they fed off of

828
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,519
and after a certain amount of time the

829
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,880
antelope started dropping dead

830
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,558
and when they went and they did the

831
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,600
autopsies on the antelope what they

832
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:37,440
found was

833
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,119
these plants were communicating with

834
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,759
each other and so what was happening is

835
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,239
they were up regulating their tannins

836
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,200
and the tannins of course can be

837
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,038
incredibly useful

838
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,480
for humans but can also be if you eat

839
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,879
consume too much of them

840
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,319
can block nutrient absorption and so

841
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,600
these animals were dropping dead because

842
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,319
they weren't getting the nutrients they

843
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,199
needed

844
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,839
and so this is this was precipitated by

845
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,759
uh

846
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,359
terpenes in the environment that went

847
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,679
off into this volatile

848
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,959
gaseous phase and you know reached the

849
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,480
next plan and said hey

850
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,319
this is dangerous and because they

851
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,519
weren't as in the same zone they

852
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,079
couldn't escape

853
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,639
uh because of the fence around the stone

854
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,398
then

855
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,679
essentially they were in a place where

856
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,000
um

857
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,600
the the antelope would have not

858
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,278
preferred to eat those compounds but

859
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,278
that's all they had to eat so they they

860
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,480
ended up passing away

861
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:29,519
so yeah terpenes communicate

862
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,240
between plants to plant and very likely

863
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,278
it's been shown through forest bathing

864
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,759
shinrin ku

865
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,679
the japanese call it that terpenes

866
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,359
communicate with humans as well

867
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,960
and so one of the things you'll see in

868
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,759
humans there's there's been these great

869
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,880
studies

870
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,879
it's called forest bathing and it's been

871
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,720
these great studies where

872
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,320
they walk people through the control

873
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,600
group grows through central park for

874
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,639
example

875
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,798
now these studies have been done in

876
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,159
germany and japan and a few of them in

877
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,639
the u.s

878
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,080
but we'll use central park as an example

879
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,278
so the control group walks through

880
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,839
central park for

881
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,679
whatever it is an hour every day whereas

882
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,720
the experimental group walks through a

883
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,480
forest

884
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,519
a regular forest every day for the same

885
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,599
hour

886
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,599
and what they find is the people that

887
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,759
were going through the forest

888
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,519
upregulated natural killer cells their

889
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,278
immune function is stronger their stress

890
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,000
hormones go down their blood pressure

891
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:25,119
goes down

892
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,960
their sleep quality improves and so the

893
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,879
the reason behind this although it's

894
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,679
still theoretical but the reason behind

895
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,480
this

896
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,278
is speculated to be terpenes from the

897
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,599
trees being

898
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:36,319
put off to in the humans and inhaling

899
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,278
them

900
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,038
so very important compounds now when we

901
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:44,079
get to cannabis plant and

902
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,440
swallowing them what's really great is a

903
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,960
lot of these terpenes tend to be

904
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,919
penetration enhancers

905
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,759
so things like limonene which by the way

906
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,759
limonene is almost the perfect

907
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:59,359
uh penetration enhancer for cannabinoids

908
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:02,480
people have commonly used menthol in the

909
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:04,398
cannabis industry but menthol is better

910
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,120
for more polar compounds to penetrate

911
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,959
the skin

912
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,719
cannabinoids as you know are not polar

913
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,360
at all they're highly lipophilic

914
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,519
with a log p of around six and so

915
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,678
they're going to need something to

916
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,720
a special kind of penetration enhancer

917
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,720
and limonene works

918
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,640
really well for that think of it as an

919
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,798
icebreaker in the arctic

920
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,799
moving through the eyes in other words

921
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,079
penetrating the transdermal

922
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:30,240
and the epidermal layers um

923
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,918
the cannabinoids can follow limonene

924
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,440
through it like a ship would follow an

925
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,640
icebreaker going through the arctic

926
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,840
wow so yeah very very important

927
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,360
compounds um little all also because

928
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,158
potentially a bit of a

929
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,199
penetration enhancer a

930
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:46,880
beta-caryophyllene not so much but

931
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,240
as we know beta-caryophyllene is

932
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,000
incredibly um

933
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:56,240
useful and important to cb2

934
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,319
signaling um so lots of compounds to to

935
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,319
like and to love in in these comp in

936
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,519
these plants and the smell

937
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,798
um too the aroma of terpenes

938
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,038
there's some really bad smelling

939
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,639
terpenes especially oxidized ones that

940
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,720
come out of labs that have been using

941
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,360
back ovens to to pull out their

942
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,120
terpenes a lot of times they're oxidized

943
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,199
and you can smell it they smell like

944
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,398
satan himself

945
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,798
but when they're fresh they're great

946
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,398
and they also go off really quickly into

947
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,440
that volatile stage just as they would

948
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,079
in the plant so

949
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,600
when you pick your cannabis the study

950
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,240
from university of mississippi some

951
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,879
years ago

952
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,440
showed that about 50 of your terpenes

953
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,240
would go

954
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,278
off into the environment in other words

955
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,399
you're losing 50

956
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:44,960
of your terpenes within 24 hours of

957
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,959
of the drying process wow

958
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,840
that's really fascinating and one thing

959
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,120
that stood out to me was this idea that

960
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,519
menthol

961
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,398
aids and absorption and is that why a

962
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,720
lot of

963
00:33:54,398 --> 00:34:03,038
pain creams smell that way

964
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,120
um no actually in that case

965
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,359
it's uh it's because the menthol tends

966
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,960
to be both a stimulating and relaxing

967
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:13,519
terpene it stimulates blood flow to the

968
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,398
to the uh area that it goes into and it

969
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,480
does penetrate

970
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,319
so it goes into the muscle but it also

971
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,719
is relaxing to muscle

972
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,599
and so that's why menthol's so popular

973
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,279
and um

974
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,039
yeah unfortunately uh many gems smell

975
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,800
like menthol because of everybody using

976
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,639
some sort of menthol rub

977
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,919
right unfortunately the cannabis

978
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,039
industry has followed that

979
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,878
uh trend and i'm i'm i think we can do

980
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,320
better than menthol smelt

981
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,239
you know there's subtleties it's like

982
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,280
good wine right you can you can have

983
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,878
some really fine

984
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:49,839
wines that have notes that are

985
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,838
enjoyable and then there's menthol

986
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,599
right and another thing that you said

987
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,918
was that you're

988
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,800
you're tired of talking about terpenes

989
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,799
and

990
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,720
it's funny that being in the industry

991
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,359
for a number of years myself

992
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,118
um i i find myself being a bit tired

993
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,239
ever or at least maybe thinking

994
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,880
or assuming everyone already knows about

995
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,919
terpenes but i think the reality is when

996
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,838
i'm talking to

997
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,079
friends or family members who you know

998
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,719
aren't so much in the industry

999
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,760
that so many consumers are blind to

1000
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,879
terpenes or

1001
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,119
what they do or um

1002
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,960
how they can kind of enhance the the

1003
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,838
aroma or the experience and

1004
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,000
i think a major problem with that is

1005
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:33,279
that

1006
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,639
not all labs are testing for them um

1007
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,519
so how do

1008
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,159
physicians clinicians or even consumers

1009
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:44,320
sort of

1010
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:47,118
navigate through that without having

1011
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,119
that information

1012
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,519
well that's a good question so you know

1013
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,320
i come from the medicinal plant field so

1014
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,559
cannabis is

1015
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,680
is to me just another medicinal plan so

1016
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,838
a lot of the tools

1017
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,598
and a lot of the thinking that i use

1018
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,000
comes from a global view of medicinal

1019
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,079
plants and not just cannabis and

1020
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,838
so speaking of global views i mean one

1021
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,760
of the things that that any herbalist

1022
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,559
worth of salt or any

1023
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,359
um quality control manager worth of salt

1024
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,920
are going to do is

1025
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,838
called organoleptic testing and again

1026
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,800
organoleptic testing is just a fancy

1027
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:20,159
name for

1028
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,200
taste smell you know appearance

1029
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,319
so you're going to really look at

1030
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,519
something and you're going to smell it

1031
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,440
you're going to taste it

1032
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,719
and you can really get a lot of

1033
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
information from that

1034
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:32,000
for example you can limonene is a really

1035
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,559
obvious

1036
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,719
aroma in cannabis linoleum is a really

1037
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,599
obvious aroma beta-carotene

1038
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,199
is a really obvious aroma so a lot of

1039
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,200
these compounds a lot of these terpenes

1040
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,799
if you start to understand their smell

1041
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,439
and even their taste yeah it's possible

1042
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,720
to

1043
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,639
make your way past not having analytics

1044
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:57,679
now ideally in an industry that's fairly

1045
00:36:54,639 --> 00:37:01,358
unregulated and has a lot to learn still

1046
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:04,239
um yeah i would be a big fan

1047
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,239
of analytics

1048
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:10,159
yeah and i know you do a lot of work

1049
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,599
training clinicians training physicians

1050
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,799
you're going to be doing that at cam at

1051
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,359
2021 as

1052
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,560
part of our medical practicum and i

1053
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,838
imagine that that

1054
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:22,320
population is very used to sort of

1055
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,400
straightforward this is the dose this is

1056
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,680
the effect for this condition

1057
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,800
how do you help them sort of

1058
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,919
get used to the idea of using a not so

1059
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,200
straightforward

1060
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,000
medicine like cannabis yeah a really

1061
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,279
good question

1062
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,639
because um i

1063
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,680
i've definitely from being uh up front

1064
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,559
and uh lecturing and talking to people

1065
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,239
about this

1066
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:49,599
i definitely see the lights go on in

1067
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,879
some but but the

1068
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,880
interest fade in others and i think i

1069
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,440
think the real way is to talk about it

1070
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,160
in their model scientifically so that

1071
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,000
they can

1072
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,399
really get it and you know i think one

1073
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,719
of the really obvious things to me

1074
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,720
that i think helps a lot of physicians

1075
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:10,159
is realize that number one

1076
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,959
plant compounds are often pleiotropic in

1077
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,279
other words

1078
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,119
they hit multiple targets their

1079
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,440
polyvalent is another term that we could

1080
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,000
use

1081
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,599
they hit multiple targets in terms of

1082
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,559
pharmacological definitions here i'm

1083
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,280
using

1084
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,759
and so that's one thing to keep in mind

1085
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,839
but then we've got another model

1086
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,280
where multiple compounds can hit the

1087
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:32,719
same target

1088
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,240
and essentially think about it you know

1089
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,919
i just talked about the stillbinoids in

1090
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:38,000
cannabis and i said yeah well there's at

1091
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,559
least half a dozen known now

1092
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,079
well right half a dozen with the same

1093
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,119
structural motif

1094
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,119
the same structural skeletal framework

1095
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,280
slightly different in terms of add-ons

1096
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,000
of oxygens or nitrogens or whatever it

1097
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
is

1098
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,679
well those compounds are going to be

1099
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,519
attracted to a lot of the same proteins

1100
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:59,039
and so it's not uncommon

1101
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,000
that you know a multiple compounds can

1102
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,239
hit more than

1103
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,039
can hit the same target and so you get

1104
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,479
this

1105
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,800
in that sense you get this

1106
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,039
pharmacodynamic synergy

1107
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,599
right from those two pieces the fact

1108
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,239
that a compound can hit multiple targets

1109
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,280
and

1110
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,279
multiple compounds can hit one target so

1111
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,240
we get these potentiated pharmacological

1112
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,760
effects

1113
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,199
and i think once people start to see

1114
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,119
that and then you lay out the network

1115
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,118
pharmacology model where we look at

1116
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:32,960
pharmacology as not about one cons

1117
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,079
one target and this has been the dogma

1118
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,280
in pharmacology is you know isolation

1119
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,640
and selectivity

1120
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,480
you know the compound's got to be

1121
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,639
selective and that's not selective we

1122
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,960
call it a dirty drug well the best thing

1123
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,319
i've

1124
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,358
i've heard um said about dirty drugs

1125
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,760
recently was

1126
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,719
dirty drugs or drugs that work in other

1127
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,240
words if you take

1128
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:56,879
gleevec for example a very famous

1129
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,679
pharma monocle for cancer molecules

1130
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,559
excuse me for

1131
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:02,719
cancer the reason it works is because it

1132
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,519
hits multiple targets and yet

1133
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,000
it was designed it was designed to hit

1134
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:08,559
one

1135
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,760
target and so this this idea of hitting

1136
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,719
one target

1137
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,520
is number one not really very oftenly

1138
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:18,719
successfully achieved in pharmacology

1139
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:22,159
and number two it's goes against

1140
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,838
all science against network pharmacology

1141
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,639
network pharmacology really suggests

1142
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,599
that we need to hit

1143
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,559
multiple places multiple nodes in a

1144
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,000
network

1145
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,239
to massage or to nudge that network

1146
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,119
towards a different order towards a

1147
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,118
different

1148
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,480
entrainment if you will because that's

1149
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,519
really what we're looking at

1150
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,480
physiology is an entrainment of

1151
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,719
patterns and once we can and we can get

1152
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,838
disease patterns we can get a

1153
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,399
homeostasis of disease

1154
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,358
and if we can push that physiology if we

1155
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,240
can nudge it

1156
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,838
off of that homeostasis of disease into

1157
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,439
a healthier place

1158
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,199
that's ultimately what we're trying to

1159
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,559
do is change the pattern right the

1160
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,239
physiological pattern

1161
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,679
and that can be done pharmacologically

1162
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,399
but let's keep in mind

1163
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,838
it can also be done with exercise with

1164
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,039
good nutrition

1165
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:16,078
with love even somebody's life right it

1166
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:16,079
it can nudges can be subtle

1167
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,159
and i did go want to go back to one

1168
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,879
point that you had made going back to

1169
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,239
terpenes

1170
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,480
forgive me um you did

1171
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,519
you did say that they could be toxic at

1172
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,079
certain levels

1173
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,119
and one thing that came up when again i

1174
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,599
was talking with

1175
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,318
with cindy orser she expressed some

1176
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,000
concern

1177
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:40,239
with the fact that some manufacturers or

1178
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,599
producers will actually add in

1179
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:46,719
terpenes to certain products

1180
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,960
to kind of scary levels

1181
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,480
i mean she was talking about you know

1182
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,240
percentages that were

1183
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,920
you know orders of magnitude higher than

1184
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:54,959
what you would find in a in a normal

1185
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,119
plant um

1186
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,400
i was wondering if you had any comments

1187
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,838
on that or if that's a concern

1188
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,680
absolutely um excuse me

1189
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,358
i have a lot of comments about that so

1190
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,919
first of all let's let's talk about

1191
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,000
nature

1192
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,880
right so when we find terpenes and

1193
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
plants they're usually below 10

1194
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,760
and so let's use that as a rule of thumb

1195
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,519
that if you've got a product with more

1196
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,200
than 10 terpenes and that's even on the

1197
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,960
high side it's going to depend on which

1198
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,358
there are terpenes that are highly toxic

1199
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,720
so you're still you're still at risk if

1200
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:28,318
we look at cannabis

1201
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,078
the terpene levels are usually about

1202
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:31,279
three to seven percent after looking at

1203
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,000
hundreds of of

1204
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,680
cfas on various products

1205
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,519
and so what we really need to be aware

1206
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,000
of is that we probably

1207
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:44,318
don't want to breach that level unless

1208
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,400
there's a very specific therapeutic

1209
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,599
activity to be done and if that's the

1210
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,838
case the person

1211
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,880
doling that terpene out needs to be

1212
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:52,159
highly trained

1213
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,000
they need to know what they're talking

1214
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,358
about and they need to be super aware of

1215
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,119
toxicity

1216
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:03,199
i have seen data on

1217
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:06,318
dabs that show up to 60 percent

1218
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:09,358
terpenes now let's talk for a second

1219
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:13,358
about this other aspect of terpenes

1220
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:16,799
they're solvents they dissolve things

1221
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:19,920
so need i say more you inhale 60

1222
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:24,720
terpenes into your brain

1223
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:28,000
the potential for highly pro-oxidant

1224
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,759
free radical production breaking down

1225
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,039
membranes

1226
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,640
inducing apoptosis of neurons pissing

1227
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:38,480
off the microglia

1228
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:39,679
and the astrocytes i mean not a good

1229
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,199
idea and

1230
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,799
and people are doing this daily i i

1231
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,559
would suggest that we're probably going

1232
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,839
to see some studies coming out about

1233
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,679
dabbing

1234
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,599
where people that long term doing it

1235
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:55,199
really have some uh

1236
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,119
unusual neurological anomalies

1237
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,799
when they're dabbing at that that sort

1238
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,920
of with that sort of product when it's

1239
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,760
up to that high

1240
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,519
and so we just need to be super aware

1241
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,359
that just terpenes because they're from

1242
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,759
plants aren't super safe they're like i

1243
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:07,039
said

1244
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,200
they're the closest thing we have to

1245
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,440
pharmaceuticals right out of a plant

1246
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:12,399
because they're so highly concentrated

1247
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,079
and potentially

1248
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,559
highly toxic so yeah we need to be aware

1249
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,760
of not only quality control in terms of

1250
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,078
what's in our products

1251
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,839
but also in terms of safety data and

1252
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,359
toxicology data

1253
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:27,199
and i don't see that happening

1254
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,960
unfortunately in the industry at this

1255
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:32,559
point

1256
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,400
yeah that's scary and i think

1257
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,639
a lot of people have this conception

1258
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,480
that you know cannabis is

1259
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:42,639
is harmless um perhaps mainly because

1260
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,559
they haven't been able to find a lethal

1261
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,759
dose of thc

1262
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,599
um but it sounds like as

1263
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,119
we as we found out in this conversation

1264
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,160
there's a lot of other compounds

1265
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,039
in the plant that at at high doses

1266
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,519
could have a very deleterious effect

1267
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,358
yeah

1268
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:04,239
i assure you that you can easily find um

1269
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:05,440
doses that will lead lethal doses of

1270
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,639
terpenes

1271
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,720
and they're not that high wow

1272
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,239
in fact there's a there's a famous story

1273
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,318
in the herbal community

1274
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,000
not the cannabis community about a woman

1275
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:17,679
in colorado i think this happened in the

1276
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,760
70s

1277
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:24,879
where she was using penny royal oil

1278
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,000
essential oil to induce an abortion and

1279
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,039
so she bought a little

1280
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,400
dram of essential oil of penny royal and

1281
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,000
she took the whole thing

1282
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,760
and guess what she died of kidney

1283
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,880
failure

1284
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,400
so yeah it's it's um it's something that

1285
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,519
the natural products industry has been

1286
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,559
dealing with for

1287
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:45,039
ever since uh it's been in its you know

1288
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,559
infancy um and only the cannabis

1289
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:50,639
industry is starting to

1290
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:53,759
realize now all right well

1291
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,519
so winding down here i did want to um

1292
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,800
give you a chance to comment on because

1293
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,960
in addition to

1294
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,000
instructing as part of our medical

1295
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,119
practicum i know

1296
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,159
you're going to be presenting as well on

1297
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,000
different extraction techniques i think

1298
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,318
and you can correct me if i'm wrong but

1299
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,679
specifically comparing a more

1300
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,279
home more home style method of

1301
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:16,399
extraction and kind of comparing it to a

1302
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,599
more commercial

1303
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,559
style of extraction to see um what the

1304
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,039
output is

1305
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,199
for cbd so i want to give you a chance

1306
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,400
to talk a bit about that and maybe give

1307
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:29,598
us a little bit of a preview

1308
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,400
of what that lecture will be about yeah

1309
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,800
sure so

1310
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,160
what we did was we mimicked a home

1311
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,720
extraction so

1312
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,358
look there's lots of people for with the

1313
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,559
price of cannabis that's out there

1314
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,598
people that actually need it for a

1315
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,078
medicine are really at a disadvantage

1316
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,359
especially if they're um if they're not

1317
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,599
making a lot of a go

1318
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,039
not making a good good wage which

1319
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,318
unfortunately united states

1320
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,838
is a huge percentage of the population

1321
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,279
and so what you're seeing is people

1322
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:58,559
growing it and then making their own

1323
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,040
medicine and so really this

1324
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,480
was we hoped that this study would be a

1325
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,079
service to

1326
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,079
um all the people out there that are at

1327
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,920
home making their own medicine

1328
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,079
and then we what we did was we mimicked

1329
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,318
a typical herbal extraction so this is

1330
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,920
not a pour over technique this is not

1331
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:18,239
you know a cold uh freeze technique um

1332
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,119
what we did is just mimicked making a

1333
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,959
typical

1334
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,680
maceration or in other words by

1335
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,358
maceration we mean soaking the plant

1336
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:28,159
in ethanol or a percolation where you're

1337
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:30,318
running it through

1338
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:33,199
a percolation cone and by the way

1339
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:34,880
percolation is how they used to make

1340
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,799
all the plants back in the days when the

1341
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,079
united states pharmacopeia was stuffed

1342
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,440
with herbal medicines

1343
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,440
because that's what we used percolation

1344
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,280
is was the preferred method

1345
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,039
and so we compared percolation to

1346
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,839
maceration and then we compared the

1347
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:50,000
maceration

1348
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,599
time points so if you talk to a

1349
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,639
traditional herbalist they'll tell you

1350
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,640
that

1351
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,799
you know you have to you have to

1352
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:01,039
masquerade for at least

1353
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,200
two weeks or if not a month and um

1354
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,719
that is not true and i've never believed

1355
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,799
that and so

1356
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:09,199
when i was at unc doing some research on

1357
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,240
echinacea which by the way has got a cb2

1358
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:15,519
a couple of cb2 ligands and i

1359
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,679
saw this opportunity to to do that and

1360
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,280
unfortunately i realized as i was

1361
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,199
doing the experiment as i was actually

1362
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,400
making the medicine making the tincture

1363
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:25,919
of the

1364
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,920
echinacea that um i had an opportunity

1365
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,079
so i didn't really plan this out

1366
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,200
but at that point in time so this is

1367
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,640
this is a good ten

1368
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,919
plus years ago um i showed that a

1369
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:38,558
24-hour

1370
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,358
uh maceration was as good as a two-week

1371
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,240
maceration

1372
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:44,239
in terms of the content of uh the

1373
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,358
isobutyl amides are also known as the

1374
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:48,799
alkalamides

1375
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:50,400
which is where the cb2 ligands come from

1376
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,000
so what we did in this study just

1377
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,039
recently is we

1378
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,400
compared three minutes to one hour to

1379
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:00,079
two weeks

1380
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:03,119
and what we found is that the hour

1381
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:06,160
was as good as the two week

1382
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,119
and the three three minute was was about

1383
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,719
94

1384
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:12,559
of the of the hour uh so we had and this

1385
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,000
is what we're measuring a cbd here not

1386
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,079
terpenes but cbd

1387
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,719
so we had a great um great

1388
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,640
good strong data there to show that now

1389
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:23,279
when we compare that to percolation and

1390
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,639
this has been an

1391
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,160
ongoing debate in herbal medicine

1392
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,159
about the strength of percolations

1393
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:31,838
versus the strength of macerations

1394
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,759
and there's advantages to both there's

1395
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:35,199
disadvantages to both but we did a

1396
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,920
typical percolation

1397
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:40,399
we found a very significant um increase

1398
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:44,079
in our cbd

1399
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,920
yield so and i'm not surprised by that

1400
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,440
at all but i think a lot of a lot of

1401
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,200
traditional herbalists will be surprised

1402
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,720
by that

1403
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,358
yeah and i think that a lot of people

1404
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,919
who are are growing plants at home

1405
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:56,719
and it seems like every season more

1406
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,880
people i know

1407
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,159
are are doing just that i think they'll

1408
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,519
be very interested to

1409
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:07,279
to see your results uh yeah i'm

1410
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:09,759
excited to show them great and just

1411
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,200
winding down now um one final thing i

1412
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,599
wanted to give you opportunity to plug

1413
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,480
any

1414
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,838
website social media or anything that

1415
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,880
you'd like the

1416
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,880
the listeners to to access to learn more

1417
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,440
about the work that you're doing

1418
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,720
yeah i appreciate that yeah i do i like

1419
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,838
to call it an audio science journal

1420
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,759
i do something called the spelman report

1421
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:34,318
spelmanreport.com we're also on facebook

1422
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,960
and uh in fact this month we we're just

1423
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:37,838
releasing

1424
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,280
a uh interview with ethan rousseau so

1425
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:42,239
it's been it's both cannabis

1426
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,640
as well as natural products and my idea

1427
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:45,439
really

1428
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,960
is to is to be of service to educate and

1429
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,920
hopefully there's good information in

1430
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,639
there we've got an

1431
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,400
episode on kovid actually a couple of

1432
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:53,519
episodes on kovid

1433
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,880
so there's there's lots of good

1434
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:55,519
information there that might be useful

1435
