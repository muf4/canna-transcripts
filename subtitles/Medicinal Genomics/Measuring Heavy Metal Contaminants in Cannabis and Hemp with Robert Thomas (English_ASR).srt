this episode we are talking all about

100
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,919
heavy metal testing with robert thomas

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,400
robert is the principal of scientific

102
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,798
solutions a consulting company that

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,438
serves the training application

104
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,438
marketing and writing needs of the trace

105
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,680
element user community

106
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:11,120
he has worked in the field of atomic and

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,159
mass spectrometry for more than 45 years

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,079
including 25 years for a manufacturer of

109
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:20,238
atomic spectroscopic instrumentation

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,478
in recent years rob has become a

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,279
prolific writer on the topic with more

112
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,319
than 100 technical publications to his

113
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,399
name

114
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,680
in fact he literally wrote the book on

115
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,239
icpms the technology labs used to detect

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,918
trace elements and in his latest book

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,478
titled measuring heavy metal

118
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,478
contaminants in cannabis and hemp he

119
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,519
applies his knowledge to the nascent

120
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,918
cannabis and hemp testing space

121
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,680
in our conversation we discuss what

122
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,719
brought rob to the cannabis and hemp

123
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,800
industry

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,560
how heavy metal testing in the cannabis

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,560
and hemp industry differs from the

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,879
pharmaceutical industry

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,600
why cannabis and hemp are particularly

128
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,918
susceptible to heavy metal contamination

129
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,360
the multiple sources of contamination

130
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,359
throughout the cultivation and

131
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,680
processing process

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,240
steps growers and producers can take to

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,079
limit heavy metal contamination and the

134
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,280
current and future regulatory

135
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:17,120
requirements for heavy metal testing

136
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,959
before we get to my conversation with

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,000
rob i'd like to thank this episode's

138
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,599
sponsor pigment tracker

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,800
the pigment tracker is a fluorescence

140
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,600
spectrophotometer designed to allow

141
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,879
cannabis processors and operators a way

142
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,280
to quickly accurately and cheaply record

143
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,399
the pigments in an extract or flower

144
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,000
sample

145
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,399
record keeping allows for more

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,720
repeatable processing which lowers the

147
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,359
likelihood that batches will be rejected

148
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,440
by clients or final consumers

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,520
for more information check out pigment

150
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,879
tracker's instagram account we've

151
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,198
provided a link in the show description

152
00:05:52,879 --> 00:06:00,360
okay and without any further ado please

153
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,360
enjoy my conversation with robert thomas

154
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:12,560
[Music]

155
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,639
good afternoon rob thanks for joining us

156
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,800
on the podcast

157
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,560
you're welcome i'm glad i could make it

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,038
okay so you have decades of experience

159
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,959
with heavy metal testing that you are

160
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,599
now applying or you're lending your

161
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,680
expertise to the cannabis industry so

162
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,479
maybe a great place to start would be

163
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,800
tell us a bit about your background and

164
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,560
what attracted you or got you started in

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,000
the cannabis industry

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,319
sure yeah

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
i think to put it all into context i

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,400
think it's good to understand that i'm

169
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,560
not from this industry but i found the

170
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,318
industry about three years ago

171
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,720
i've been work 25 years for the

172
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,960
perkinelma corporation as an analytical

173
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,479
chemist in the field of atomic and mass

174
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,399
spectroscopy

175
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,719
i took one of the retirement packages a

176
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,879
few years ago and i ventured into the

177
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,800
field of science writing i always like

178
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,918
to write i think i was reasonably good

179
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,598
at doing it

180
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,079
so i started looking around for

181
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,199
opportunities fortunately i had made a

182
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:14,159
lot of good editorial contacts

183
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,720
and i started getting requests to write

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,840
about trace element analysis um probably

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,599
the

186
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,198
one thing that put me on the map with

187
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,560
regard to trace element analysis

188
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,120
publications was i did a 15 part series

189
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,199
on icp ms

190
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,478
for the journal spectroscopy in the mid

191
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,319
2000s

192
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,360
that gave me a lot of visibility and a

193
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,639
lot of exposure it eventually led to a

194
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,319
textbook

195
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,400
on icpms

196
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,680
in the mid 2000s and all of a sudden

197
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,598
i was getting visibility um

198
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,199
in a global sense because my book was

199
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,279
sold all over the world it was english

200
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,000
of course but i was fortunate enough to

201
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,239
get it translated into mandarin and into

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,160
spanish so that gave me additional

203
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,800
visibility

204
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,280
at that time i was asked to serve on the

205
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,280
american chemical society

206
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,439
committee for reagent chemicals i was

207
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,839
asked to lead the heavy metals task

208
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,399
force so i came on

209
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,279
on board right about that time

210
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,439
and

211
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,159
i was fortunate enough to be involved

212
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,839
with helping united states pharmacopoeia

213
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,280
update their heavy metal testing

214
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,959
procedure

215
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:27,119
which eventually came out in chapters

216
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,878
232 and 233 the acs was an interested

217
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,478
stakeholder

218
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,680
with the usp

219
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,639
and

220
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,038
we had both used a heavy metal test for

221
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:40,000
almost 100 years which was a

222
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,319
colorimetric sulfide precipitation test

223
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
which was very crude and did not work

224
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,000
correctly and

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,159
it was impacted by the experience of the

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,080
analysis it was totally inappropriate

227
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,399
and it was only for a small group of

228
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
metals lead in particular

229
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,720
so

230
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,640
usp

231
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
um were

232
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,600
were involved with changing that method

233
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,519
because the pharmaceutical industry

234
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,879
for so many years did not have an

235
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,720
accurate test

236
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,838
to actually quantify elemental

237
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,000
impurities in pharmaceutical products so

238
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,800
with the fda behind them

239
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,120
usp were tasked with coming out with

240
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,759
brand new plasma spectrochemistry test

241
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,919
methods to come out with a

242
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,399
an accurate and precise test for

243
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,879
replacing that sulfide precipitation

244
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,000
test and at the acs

245
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,958
we were also doing that because our book

246
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,200
of companion standards is a book that's

247
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:39,039
recommended by usp

248
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,720
in their usp nfl book and we found that

249
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,120
if we were going to change our method

250
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,360
and usp were changing their method

251
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,799
it would be good to align them so in

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,879
fact i was on

253
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,519
many meetings with the usp which

254
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,278
discussed how would we change the method

255
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,720
what was important and how we would go

256
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,399
about the process of changing it

257
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,440
usp

258
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,078
worked very slowly acs does to a certain

259
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,519
extent but we managed to change our

260
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,319
methodology

261
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,839
from the sulfide precipitation test to

262
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,000
icp oes and icpms in a few years

263
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,399
yet usp took

264
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,879
in excess of 15 years to do that it was

265
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,200
frustrating but we understood that at

266
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,799
that time because they were trying to

267
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,720
align the method

268
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,439
with europe and the rest of the world

269
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,320
and particularly to align it with ich q

270
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,640
3d directives so they took a long time

271
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:37,519
but in january 2018 they come out with a

272
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,078
standardized method for both icp oes and

273
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,078
icpms together

274
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:46,159
with elemental impurities for 24

275
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,519
heavy metals based on the method of

276
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,240
delivery

277
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,000
so they came out in 2018

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,000
i had worked with them over over a

279
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
number of years up to that point being

280
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,639
the heavy metals

281
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,639
leader of the task force at the acs so i

282
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,879
saw an opportunity

283
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,319
to really leverage that information

284
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,320
which i've learned

285
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,360
and i was still going ahead with my

286
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,920
writing and i just felt that based on

287
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,839
that i presented to my publisher

288
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,278
an opportunity for another book which

289
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,279
was elemental impurities and

290
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,320
pharmaceuticals

291
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,320
if you know

292
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,839
if you know textbook publishers it takes

293
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,200
a whole lot of proposals and

294
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,880
justifications to get something approved

295
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,480
so it took a while but eventually they

296
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,399
agreed

297
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
for me to go ahead and do that so i gave

298
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,639
them an outline

299
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,519
took me um i used a lot of the material

300
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,838
that i put together for my rcpms book

301
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,360
so it didn't take as long

302
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
to actually put together a book on

303
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,519
elemental impurities in pharmaceuticals

304
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,399
it took me another 12 months

305
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,159
but

306
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,120
it helped having done a book

307
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,958
so

308
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,799
in march of 2018 to coincide with the

309
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,559
approval of usp chapters 232 and 233 i

310
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,159
came out with my book

311
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,518
which was great for me because it put me

312
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,078
on the map in the pharmaceutical

313
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,799
industry so that again gave me a lot of

314
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,120
opportunities and a lot of more

315
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,759
writing possibilities

316
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,278
however at that time i got to know the

317
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,039
usp folks very well they suggested that

318
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,278
i should take a look at the

319
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,360
cannabis industry because they felt that

320
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,439
they were in need of help and they did

321
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
not have a good understanding

322
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,920
of heavy metal contaminants in the

323
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,278
entire manufacturing process from

324
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,958
cultivation

325
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,399
to processing to extraction to

326
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,399
production to packaging to delivery so

327
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,519
i'm a little hesitant i just finished a

328
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:43,440
book and as a writer of books

329
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,360
it consumes you for the time you're

330
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,360
writing it you really don't have time to

331
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,240
do anything else so i just finished my

332
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,320
pharma book so i was hesitant to

333
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,320
really get involved but i did i started

334
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,200
talking to some contact names they gave

335
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,320
me

336
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,240
and i started realizing wow um this is

337
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,480
an industry that's exciting

338
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,480
it's fractured it's chaotic but what an

339
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,959
opportunity what an opportunity to make

340
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,519
a difference so i said i said i've got

341
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,119
to do this so i went to my publisher

342
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,600
again i said

343
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,078
i would like you to consider another

344
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,920
book i at that time i had no outline for

345
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,159
a book but i just felt

346
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,639
that the industry was primed for putting

347
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,838
together an educational resource to help

348
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,759
the industry

349
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,040
understand this topic of heavy metal

350
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,720
contaminants

351
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,679
so again i had to write another proposal

352
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,480
justification they agreed to it

353
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,039
that was about two years ago it took me

354
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,959
another year to put it together again i

355
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:42,159
use components from my farmer book and

356
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,559
components from my icpms book

357
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,600
and i just laid in

358
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,399
a cannabis piece of the of the book and

359
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,959
i found that very interesting because i

360
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,198
got a lot of input from the folks i just

361
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,838
met in the cannabis industry of folks

362
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,759
that i'd connected with because that

363
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,680
first year i was just learning how the

364
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,078
industry worked

365
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,919
and that's and that's all i did was to

366
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,399
talk their jargon to fully understand

367
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,719
how it was working and how the dynamics

368
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,240
between cultivators and processes and

369
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
regulators

370
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,879
and all the things that all the things

371
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,480
that go with you know with the industry

372
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,439
so anyway um

373
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,360
i did i sat down and um i wrote a

374
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,600
proposal wrote an outline and eventually

375
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,720
came out with a book heavy metal

376
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,600
contaminants in cannabis and hemp in

377
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
december 2020 so that was over a year

378
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,639
ago

379
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,039
but that kind of got me the visibility

380
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,839
and installed all of a sudden i was

381
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,639
getting so many requests for writing

382
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,880
publishing and speaking engagements and

383
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,639
that started my journey which

384
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,879
i'm still on the train i still can't get

385
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,198
off it's very difficult to

386
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,078
the demand for my time is pretty crazy

387
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,319
but

388
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,198
you know i relish that i welcome it and

389
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,278
when i got a request to speak at tanmed

390
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,919
i said i've got to do that

391
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,600
unfortunately uh i had to find funding

392
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,879
for it it took me two days to get

393
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,159
funding for my travel so but i did so um

394
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,240
i'm all signed up to talk at canmed so

395
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,360
and with with that you got involved and

396
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,560
uh dad put me in contact with you and

397
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,560
this is where we are and here we are

398
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,319
and we're happy to have you uh as you

399
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,239
know you know analytical testing or

400
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,519
safety testing it's one of our key focus

401
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,320
areas for

402
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,360
for canmed so to have someone like you

403
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,278
to to

404
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,039
give us information or or share your

405
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,759
knowledge around heavy metal testing

406
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,480
it's um it's invaluable for sure

407
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,159
and

408
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
so i wanted to ask you so once you've

409
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,240
shifted from you know pharmaceuticals to

410
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,679
cannabis um in terms of heavy metal

411
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
testing what were some of the

412
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,919
differences that you found whether it's

413
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,600
you know in what heavy metals they're

414
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,078
actually looking for or techniques that

415
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,040
they're using or just sophistication of

416
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,879
equipment

417
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,480
what were some of the things that you

418
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,639
you noticed

419
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,039
well um i think the first thing i

420
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,799
noticed was that

421
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,120
the pharmaceutical industry

422
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:11,039
took 15 plus years to come out with

423
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,278
comprehensive elemental impurities so

424
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,958
they had to go the whole process of

425
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:18,078
carrying out

426
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,758
a comprehensive risk assessment study of

427
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,679
the industry

428
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,360
based on the toxicity of the metals that

429
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,319
are likely to be found somewhere in the

430
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,839
manufacturing process and doing a

431
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,079
complete understanding of where those

432
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,440
elemental impurities might occur and at

433
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,879
what levels

434
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,639
and documenting them in something that

435
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,559
the pharmaceutical industry could read

436
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,680
and understand and that is fully

437
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:48,559
documented in ich q3d directives and um

438
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,399
it it goes through exactly how the how

439
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,319
the pharmaceutical industry approached

440
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,958
this when i came into the cannabis

441
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,120
industry i started asking people have

442
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,879
you done a risk risk assessment of heavy

443
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,879
metals in your products and there was

444
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,439
this blank stare or black

445
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,679
it was like what is a risk assessment

446
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,160
study so i you know i had to come to

447
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,360
grips with that but clearly the cannabis

448
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,959
industry

449
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,558
were not flying by the seat of their

450
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,759
pants but they did not have a good

451
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,119
understanding from cultivation

452
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,558
to extraction to i mean everything

453
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,239
everything

454
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,599
involved there are so many contact

455
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,078
points and i began to uncover those as i

456
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,000
started as i started getting information

457
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,279
as i started doing research of my own

458
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,599
but sometimes

459
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,440
i was getting evasive answers from many

460
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,918
people the thing about the cannabis

461
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,360
energy some folks are not eager to share

462
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,400
with someone who is just coming in

463
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,399
trying to understand what's going on

464
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,480
that's unfortunate um

465
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,880
but you know i got some responses but i

466
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,200
did a lot of research on my own

467
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,640
and i found out there was no

468
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,319
understanding of risk assessment with

469
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,640
regard to heavy metals

470
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,240
and it was something that i felt

471
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
strongly about

472
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,919
and

473
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,159
one of the things i realized was when i

474
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,320
was kind of on my own i was a someone

475
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,160
coming into the industry with a lot of

476
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,200
experience and knowledge and trace sound

477
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,759
analysis

478
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,840
but no no no one really knew me in the

479
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,519
cannabis industry so i thought how can i

480
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,000
get credibility

481
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,639
so what so actually so what i did was i

482
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,119
started working with organizations where

483
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,120
i'd work with not so much in the past

484
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,959
but organizations i knew would have an

485
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,599
impact on the cannabis industry like

486
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,400
aoac astm

487
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,719
nist

488
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,679
so i started and i'd had good contacts

489
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,519
at these organizations so i went to them

490
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,759
and volunteered my time obviously and

491
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,679
astm were eager to bring me in because

492
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,759
they didn't really have

493
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,600
any heavy metal expertise

494
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,400
within the committees or subcommittees

495
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,319
people who are knowledgeable but no one

496
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,960
if you like with as much expertise as i

497
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:53,279
had so that was nice that they that they

498
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,840
welcomed me in one of the first things

499
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,720
that i recommended was i wanted to get

500
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,639
together a workshop or a symposia which

501
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,640
highlighted this which brought this out

502
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,360
into the public domain because to me it

503
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,440
wasn't in the public domain it was in

504
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,519
cannabis cultivators processors

505
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,558
regulators there was a little component

506
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,359
of this

507
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,119
um

508
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,319
you know lots of people had but it

509
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,719
wasn't out there in the public domain so

510
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,599
i asked them if they would support me in

511
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,558
a heavy metal workshop this was this is

512
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,480
a year ago now and we talked about it

513
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,000
again i had to write a proposal but i

514
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,798
was used to writing proposals and

515
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,440
justifications so we eventually put

516
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:36,319
together a workshop last summer

517
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,720
three-day workshop um i was the chair

518
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,960
but supported by astm

519
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,079
and we got abstract we got something

520
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,279
like

521
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:49,038
22 abstracts and then 22 papers in

522
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,119
just specifically on heavy metals and

523
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,440
whole aspects of heavy metals from

524
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,519
instrument vendors uh from from

525
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,720
cultivators from i mean from the whole

526
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,960
industry from from academia and that

527
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,720
really brought it to the surface so

528
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,120
if you like i think that's where the

529
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,600
industry started

530
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:10,158
started saying okay so we need to do

531
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,319
something but things started moving very

532
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,480
slowly but that was the major difference

533
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,639
between working in pharma and working in

534
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,400
cannabis with farmer you had a highly

535
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,880
regulated industry

536
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,880
and in cannabis you have a highly

537
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
unregulated industry if you can call the

538
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,120
state's regulators they are but there's

539
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,558
only so much they can do and they don't

540
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,719
have the knowledge and expertise uh to

541
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,960
really regulate the industry in a

542
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
meaningful way yeah

543
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,440
no and i think that's a that's a symptom

544
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,279
of the industry in general right is that

545
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,000
you know a lot of us

546
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,918
regulators cultivators everyone was sort

547
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,038
of asked to run

548
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,360
directly after legalization and you know

549
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,200
yeah and you know

550
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,599
industries like the pharmaceutical

551
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
industry have had decades of experience

552
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,319
and

553
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
you know well-regulated

554
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,558
processes and everything that they've

555
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,240
built upon uh where we are just sort of

556
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,240
making not making up as we go we're

557
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
doing the best that we can but um

558
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,558
there's certainly more work to be done

559
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,360
there so i want to take this i want to

560
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,599
take a step back a bit and just talk

561
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,158
about heavy metals in general like what

562
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,399
elements are we talking about here um

563
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,559
what is their potential damage or uh

564
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,679
effects that they could have on humans

565
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,639
consuming them and why in particular

566
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,038
um

567
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,919
are cannabis and hemp sort of

568
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,879
susceptible to contamination

569
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,000
okay

570
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,799
um

571
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,798
well

572
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,038
we know the cannabis and hemp are really

573
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,240
excellent

574
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:42,960
phytoaccumulators they will they will

575
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,679
accumulate any male or any okay not so

576
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,440
much heavy metals but any elements

577
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,360
that are in the soil or in the growing

578
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,840
medium um

579
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,599
they will attract it and absorb it and

580
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,720
it does not affect their health and it

581
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,959
does not affect their rate of growth so

582
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,279
for decades they've been used as phyto

583
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,200
remediators to clean up toxic waste

584
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,558
sites you know chernobyl being one

585
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,400
example of cleaning up heavy metals

586
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,759
you know radionuclides and they've done

587
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,559
a really good job of doing that but

588
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,000
there are other other plans for doing

589
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,960
that um

590
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,240
the whole science of fighter remediation

591
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,840
is is uh is it is a fascinating topic

592
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,000
and there are many plants that can do

593
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,399
that but fortunately or unfortunately

594
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,119
cannabis and hemp are one of the best

595
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,720
fighter remediators so they are used for

596
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,199
that purpose

597
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,919
on the downside a plant is used for

598
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,038
cannabinoids and other

599
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,440
you know the the production of other

600
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,038
things that we consume

601
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,679
it really means that you have to be

602
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:48,079
careful where you plant cannabis in them

603
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,480
now in the early days the majority of

604
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:54,319
the plants were grown indoors whether

605
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,640
hydroponically or in greenhouses indoors

606
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,599
where the growing conditions are far

607
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,600
more

608
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,918
far more stable

609
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,798
it's a it's an environment which can be

610
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,038
controlled so you don't have the impact

611
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,440
of weather you don't have the impact of

612
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,359
soil or you don't have the impact of any

613
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,759
contaminants that might be in an

614
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,158
external growing medium so that's the

615
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,879
first point to emphasize so if it's in

616
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,880
the growing medium it will be absorbed

617
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,200
into the plant it will get absorbed

618
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,000
through the roots and stay in the leaves

619
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,840
the shoots the stalks um the leaves and

620
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,839
eventually end up in the flowers and

621
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,079
there's a number of studies out there

622
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,240
which show the ratio of how it's

623
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,720
deposited in these different components

624
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,960
of the plant and that in itself is a

625
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,600
is a fascinating um you know a

626
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,159
fascinating way to look at it um

627
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,399
but the thing is that um

628
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,240
some of the most toxic heavy metals

629
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,480
which we have which we have as humans

630
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,880
caused anthropogenically we have

631
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,798
contaminated much of the soil and much

632
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,080
of the contamination

633
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:02,839
that we have given to our soil is based

634
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:06,798
on using metals like lead

635
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:09,199
mercury cadmium arsenic which uh

636
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,759
if you like the repercussions of an

637
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,798
industrial world where we're continually

638
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,119
putting

639
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:18,079
heavy metal contaminants out

640
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:21,199
into the environment whether it's from

641
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:23,519
lead pipes from water supplies whether

642
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,440
there's leaded gasoline whether it's

643
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,158
from

644
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,080
lead in paint so lead in particular but

645
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,600
mercury mercury is another element that

646
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,839
we've done very well

647
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,399
or contaminated the environment

648
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,839
you know power plants spew out 100 tons

649
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,519
of mercury every year and it goes on

650
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,399
plants into the soil and into the

651
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,558
aquatic systems and unfortunately once

652
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,880
it gets in the aquatic systems um it

653
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,639
gets converted to methylmercury

654
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,960
by the bottom feeders and then it goes

655
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,120
up the food chain and that's why you've

656
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,960
got to be careful when you eat

657
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,479
fish like uh

658
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,880
like tuna or

659
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,159
swordfish which are predator fish which

660
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,480
will consume all the smaller fish and it

661
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,799
goes up the food chain so as a result of

662
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,839
that the big four lead cabbie mastic and

663
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:14,240
mercury are by far the most toxic and by

664
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,639
far the most of environmental concern

665
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,159
but it's not only those that are other

666
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,919
what are called

667
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,278
heavy metals although heavy metals is

668
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,038
not a

669
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,278
group in the periodic table so when

670
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,119
people say heavy metals i ask them what

671
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,798
they mean because it could mean

672
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,278
different elements to different people

673
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,278
but obviously classically the big four

674
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,319
lead cabinet mastering of mercury but

675
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:40,000
elements like chromium manganese

676
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:42,720
copper nickel iron zinc i mean there are

677
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,359
so many which can be quote unquote heavy

678
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,919
metals so we have to be aware of that if

679
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,719
they're in the soil they will end up in

680
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,720
the plant and ultimately when they will

681
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,600
end up in the flower and if they end up

682
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,759
in the flower or anywhere in the biomass

683
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,158
and that biomass you extract the

684
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,038
cannabinoid whatever the cannabinoid is

685
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,440
um it will it will end up to some degree

686
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:08,879
and then as you process that through the

687
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,558
system depending on what process is used

688
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,640
you get concentration you get

689
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,000
purification and you get additional

690
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,120
elements brought

691
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,519
into

692
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,079
into the equation because

693
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,278
it will absorb whatever it's in contact

694
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,599
with

695
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,359
you know metal-wise stainless steel

696
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,079
brass um

697
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,759
anything and i'm sure we'll get into

698
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,759
this but there's the whole thing about

699
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,599
vaping devices which has nothing to do

700
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,240
with the production of categories but

701
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,719
it's the way they're delivered and

702
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,440
unfortunately we have what are called

703
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,759
vaping devices which uh

704
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,960
unfortunately they are little devices

705
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,038
which uh

706
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,480
which contain lots of metal components

707
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,240
and when you vape with elevated

708
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,200
temperatures never mind if there's

709
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,960
nothing

710
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
in the cbd extract or whatever the

711
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,480
liquid is

712
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,720
you have the high potential of actually

713
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,640
corroding the internal metal components

714
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,519
and producing nanoparticles of that

715
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,600
metal

716
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,278
which the consumer or the vapor will

717
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,439
take into their lens that's a totally

718
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,720
different subject but

719
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,519
you know it has to be brought into the

720
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,079
equation but the thing is that uh it's

721
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,558
very difficult to eliminate

722
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,639
any kind of metal from a plant that you

723
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,480
grow outdoors so you have to deal with

724
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,080
that how do you deal with it how can you

725
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,919
mitigate it can you mitigate it if you

726
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,199
can't mitigate it how do you reduce the

727
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,559
impact

728
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,798
so yeah

729
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,319
excellent and now if i understand

730
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,398
correctly

731
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:35,200
is this less of a concern with other

732
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:36,558
crops because they're not as efficient

733
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,640
as

734
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,879
cannabis and hemp are in terms of

735
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,679
accumulating these metals

736
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,000
um

737
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,919
yeah i think uh

738
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,079
it's a fact of life that hemp and

739
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,000
cannabis are really good fighter

740
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,480
mediators they're really good at hyper

741
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,798
accumulating what's in the soil but no

742
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,798
it's not it's not um

743
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,839
there's other plants which

744
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:02,319
which will will absorb heavy metals and

745
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,158
some of those plants we consume there's

746
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,519
been a number of reports out and i've

747
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,080
i've reported on them and i can

748
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,200
certainly send you the information but

749
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,359
um

750
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,200
arsenic in rice arsenic is a big problem

751
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,519
with rice because it's predominantly

752
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,798
grown in flooded fields and

753
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:21,038
unfortunately arsenic is a big component

754
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,200
in soil there's lots of bastard console

755
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,079
so if it's if

756
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,480
rice is being grown in flooded fields

757
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:31,278
the arsenal gets into the water and the

758
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,919
water and it gets extracted it gets

759
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,720
absorbed by the rice and there's a study

760
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,038
put out recently on arsenic in infant

761
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,000
cereal right and of course infant cereal

762
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:44,798
contains a lot of rice and um actually

763
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,240
congress got hold of this report and

764
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,918
they um

765
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,919
they went to the fda and say hey what's

766
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,440
going on this is not acceptable because

767
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,640
the fda does not do a good job of

768
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,320
regulating

769
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,120
food in general for heavy metals yet

770
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:59,359
alone infant cereals so yeah

771
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,038
there was a port recently of high levels

772
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,918
of cadmium and chocolate

773
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,640
um

774
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,038
it gets into cocoa beans um

775
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,480
yeah it's it's yeah it isn't only

776
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,558
cannabis and hemp

777
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,399
it's a problem as humans we have

778
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,200
contaminated the environment

779
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:18,558
and we have contaminated on a global

780
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,798
scale i read a report recently that

781
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,839
up to one-third of arable land in the

782
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:26,158
world is contaminated some to some

783
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,319
degree with heavy metals or some kind of

784
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,640
metal contaminant that's pretty scary

785
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,839
when you consider if that translates to

786
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,038
the us

787
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:37,038
so one field in three is contaminated

788
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,599
so the this is what we have to deal with

789
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,679
and um the industry is not doing a good

790
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,158
job of understanding

791
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,240
and dealing with that and this is this

792
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,080
is this is the whole this is the area

793
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,839
that i'm trying to bring

794
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,798
trying to bring exposure visibility to

795
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,240
the industry but it's serious and you're

796
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,038
okay at the moment because the industry

797
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,798
is moving so fast so rapid and it's

798
00:29:57,038 --> 00:29:59,679
growing so quickly

799
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,000
um

800
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,000
with very little serious regulations at

801
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,319
some point in time the federal

802
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,839
government we're going to have oversight

803
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,319
and based on what's going on in the

804
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,240
pharmaceutical industry um

805
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,558
i think there could be some serious

806
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,519
decisions to be made

807
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,918
right

808
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,839
you know you briefly touched on

809
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,600
maybe some ways to kind of prevent

810
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,519
getting heavy metals into your cannabis

811
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,759
whether it's making sure that the soil

812
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,000
is free of heavy metals or that if

813
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:30,079
you're using you know hydroponics making

814
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,278
sure that you have good water source but

815
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,359
i'm curious

816
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,398
if you know that you have cannabis

817
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,158
material that is contaminated with heavy

818
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,798
metals is there any opportunity for

819
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,440
remediation or removing them or it can

820
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,679
is it something that you can extract out

821
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,840
what can you do yeah it can be extracted

822
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,360
out but it's extremely expensive i i

823
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,599
talked to someone fairly recently about

824
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,759
that someone who would

825
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,879
who would just um

826
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,240
who had just grown a large batch of hemp

827
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,600
i actually i can't remember where it was

828
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,839
i think it was in colorado but i can't

829
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,319
remember and they

830
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,240
they contacted me and asked me what what

831
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,558
what are the opportunities to mitigate

832
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,880
or reduce the heavy metal

833
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,879
level in this plant and there are there

834
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,519
are ways of doing it um

835
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,159
you know extraction for example but they

836
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,880
are

837
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,799
extremely expensive so i said

838
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,760
you know there's a chance i don't know

839
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:23,679
um

840
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,599
but there's a chance that you might have

841
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,798
to destroy that crop which they didn't

842
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,839
want to hear

843
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,798
um

844
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:33,119
but it's i i hear of this all the time

845
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,359
and even though i can tell you

846
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,278
that the industry is concerned about it

847
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,678
there are ways that they could reduce

848
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:42,000
heavy metals by using

849
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,798
higher purity nutrients

850
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,599
clean fertilizers water that's water

851
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:50,240
that's been tested trust me

852
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,439
if you if you were growing hemp in say

853
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,278
an area

854
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,600
where they know where you know they use

855
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,759
leaded pipes and using that supply of

856
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,918
water guaranteed there would be lead in

857
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,839
the water supply and guaranteed it would

858
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,000
end up in the plant so it's stuff like

859
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,439
this you you've got to be you've got to

860
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,679
pay attention to what you're doing and

861
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,558
you've got to pay attention to how you

862
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,720
can mitigate or reduce the level of

863
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,720
heavy metals in the planet eventually

864
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,558
the flower so there are ways of doing it

865
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,440
but uh um

866
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:21,599
i've um i actually give a talk at a

867
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,240
analytical cannabis workshop the past

868
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,240
couple of days wednesday and thursday

869
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,278
and someone else who gave a talk before

870
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,240
me was from penn state and he gave a

871
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,119
talk

872
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,599
actually on that problem of how do you

873
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,558
reduce or how do you mitigate the

874
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,158
transfer of heavy metals from the soil

875
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:41,678
into the cannabis and hemp plant it was

876
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,880
a fascinating talk

877
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,320
and um

878
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,200
i hope there were people listening to

879
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,720
that because this is where

880
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,200
this is where we can have the biggest

881
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,519
impact of getting clean cannabis and

882
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,720
hemp is that is at the cultivation stage

883
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,079
excellent

884
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,919
yeah and

885
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,000
you know kind of before we went on that

886
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,840
you were talking about regulations and i

887
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,480
did want to ask you about that so i know

888
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:08,639
that heavy metal testing it's well first

889
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,599
of all regulation is out is very state

890
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,519
dependent as we know so

891
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,319
to your knowledge you know what states

892
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,399
are requiring heavy metal testing and

893
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,240
as we know at least on our side from

894
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,918
medicinal genomics that

895
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,798
um you know the state to state

896
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,960
requirements can can vary vastly where

897
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,639
some can be sort of overly inclusive

898
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,840
with too many things and others can be

899
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,960
drastically

900
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,439
under

901
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,519
under inclusive so in your opinion you

902
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,200
know which states are getting it right

903
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,880
or what do you think are the most

904
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,600
important heavy metals that folks should

905
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
be testing for well um you know to start

906
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,839
with um

907
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,278
when

908
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:49,278
when states started regulating cannabis

909
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,798
and they came up with a list of four

910
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,798
heavy metals

911
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,960
that was predominantly they looked to

912
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,480
the dietary supplements industry and

913
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,200
they looked to the american herbal

914
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,120
pharmacopoeia who were only

915
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,919
who were only only had the big four

916
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,278
heavy metals on a list of heavy metals

917
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,679
to monitor

918
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:10,159
for for dietary supplements

919
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,800
and herbal products so i can understand

920
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,760
where they came from however what has

921
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,440
happened

922
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,679
as the industry

923
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,679
and different states have come on board

924
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,599
they have been a little more proactive

925
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,159
in trying to understand well what other

926
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,639
heavy metals could be of concern and a

927
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,720
number of the states have

928
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,800
increased that panel new york for

929
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,799
example has nine on the list the big

930
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,200
four

931
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,560
plus chromium nickel

932
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,279
um

933
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:42,000
barium zinc selenium and i think one

934
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,560
other kind of zinc yeah but anyway so

935
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,960
okay so they have nine maryland had um

936
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,559
selenium silver barium and chromium but

937
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,519
they've recently

938
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:55,519
uh dialed back on selenium

939
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,119
silver and barium i don't know why so

940
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,320
they have chromium in it sort of the big

941
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,440
four um michigan has the big four plus

942
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,280
um

943
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,000
copper nickel

944
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,359
chromium and inorganic arsenic now

945
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,119
michigan are an anomaly i don't

946
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,519
understand because no other state has

947
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,480
inorganic arsenic so i'm trying to find

948
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,599
out

949
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,838
why michigan decided to

950
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,760
specify inorganic assets there doesn't

951
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,920
be any any apparent reason why they do

952
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,720
that because i've talked to a state

953
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,039
testing lab and they report total assets

954
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,319
so i just think that maybe state

955
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,920
regulators don't understand the

956
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,359
difference i don't know i'm not being

957
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,639
unkind to them but

958
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:34,319
there's no reason why they should have

959
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,920
done that um

960
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,240
so i think some states are being

961
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,000
proactive and um

962
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,399
i've i've got involved with a number of

963
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,639
states idea oregon

964
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,119
who had no heavy metals limits put out

965
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:49,920
for public comment their new regulations

966
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,079
and i sent um i sent my comments in

967
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,920
together with a few of my publications

968
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,240
to suggest that you should be monitoring

969
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,680
maybe up to 15

970
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,399
i don't know whether they will do that

971
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,480
but uh at least uh i put it out

972
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,519
you know i put it i put it to them in

973
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,760
public comment and connecticut also had

974
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,519
um were revising the heavy metals

975
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,119
regulations and wanted public comment on

976
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:14,719
that so i sent those in as well um but

977
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,079
you know what i tell statewide because i

978
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,480
know what i i know a lot of state

979
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,720
regulators they they kind of understand

980
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,119
what i'm doing i'm very sympathetic but

981
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,959
i think they they they understand that

982
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,440
they they don't want to be the first to

983
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,159
expand the panel to say 15. so i think

984
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,480
they're waiting for other states but i

985
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,679
keep reminding them nist have recently

986
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,000
come out with a toxic metal certified

987
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:41,358
reference material which contains up to

988
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,719
13 elements so so i said look the nest

989
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,920
they believe that this should be

990
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,319
regulated more like tobacco

991
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,400
than it should be um you know as it's

992
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,160
being regulated at the moment

993
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,680
i serve on the astm committee d37 and

994
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,239
i'm on a number of subcommittees one of

995
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,719
them is the laboratory subcommittee and

996
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,799
we have just written a method

997
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,519
for up to 21 elements

998
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,039
in cannabis related materials by icpms

999
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,880
we're currently going through the review

1000
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,800
process now

1001
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,680
um so hopefully that will come out in

1002
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,000
the next month or so so really excited

1003
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,399
that astm are supporting me on this so

1004
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,519
they only have the 21 elements in that

1005
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,519
method

1006
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:26,880
and also which is which is brand new um

1007
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,239
usp have put out for public comment um

1008
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,920
they posted

1009
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:34,078
a draft monograph for cbd to be used as

1010
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,960
an api so this would be

1011
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,359
cbd to be used in a pharmacist or a drug

1012
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,240
formulation so you're talking about

1013
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,838
um you know epidialex or maybe other

1014
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,559
drugs that are going through fda

1015
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:49,039
approval which contain cbd

1016
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,078
and in that draft proposal

1017
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,400
they say

1018
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,280
that it must meet requirements of

1019
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,440
chapter 232 for elemental impurities

1020
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,240
well that that's telling me

1021
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,880
that if they have that cbd monograph

1022
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,838
in their book of compendium standards

1023
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,760
to make cbd uh that's that's of the

1024
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,239
quality required for

1025
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,560
an fda-based drug you're gonna have to

1026
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,759
be monitoring up to 24 elemental

1027
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,799
impurities

1028
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
so

1029
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,800
this is telling me this is the way the

1030
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,960
industry's going and i'm trying to get

1031
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,599
the cannabis industry on board

1032
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,079
to really think about this because you

1033
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,760
know you'd only be in a position where

1034
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,800
when you're two years down the road fda

1035
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,960
comes in

1036
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,640
and says well um

1037
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,320
what's your list of elemental impurities

1038
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,559
how many are you monitoring what you

1039
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,800
know what's going on here i i mean it

1040
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,358
obviously won't be as simple as that but

1041
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,800
i'm telling you based on my research all

1042
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:45,279
the signs are

1043
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,640
that the elemental panel is going to be

1044
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,160
expanded

1045
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,039
so

1046
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,118
yeah wow and so you mentioned all the

1047
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,599
different elements that folks should be

1048
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,680
monitoring so i'm curious

1049
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,519
what is like an acceptable limit for

1050
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,679
these elements does it differ for for

1051
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,119
each elements are some sort of like pass

1052
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,879
fail where you don't want a trace of

1053
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,480
anything or in others there's sort of a

1054
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,960
limit that's acceptable

1055
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,519
well what the states are using is the

1056
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,440
pde limits that were generated

1057
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,039
for drug compounds drug substances um

1058
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,400
and this is

1059
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,880
this is described in ich q3d directives

1060
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,480
where they spent 15 years to

1061
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,200
understand toxicity based on

1062
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,480
well-established animal models so that's

1063
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,319
that information

1064
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,719
for pharmaceuticals is documented and

1065
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,320
it's good it's it's good data based on

1066
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,159
pharmaceutical delivery but you've got

1067
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,240
to understand that pharmaceuticals are

1068
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:43,199
delivered basically four different ways

1069
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:45,919
orally inhalation intravenously and

1070
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:48,159
transdermal so there are four different

1071
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,280
categories of pharmaceuticals as you can

1072
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:53,920
imagine an inhalation has much lower pde

1073
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,400
limits than say a normal delivered drug

1074
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,440
but also remember that these are limits

1075
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,358
per day

1076
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,358
so the way they define them in chapter

1077
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:05,199
232 and i see hq 3d directives is is

1078
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,358
maximum limits per day

1079
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,439
and they give you an example if a

1080
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,119
pharmaceutical compound has a maximum

1081
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,079
has a maximum

1082
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,200
delivery maximum of 10 gram per day you

1083
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,560
divide these daily maximum limits by 10

1084
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,039
and you can come out with an

1085
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,400
approximation of what you need to have

1086
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,318
in your product

1087
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,800
well that's great because the

1088
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:30,639
pharmaceutical industry

1089
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,640
you know is well used to defining you

1090
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,960
know delivery amounts and mode of

1091
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,920
administration the cannabis industry is

1092
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,199
not so if you define 10 gram per day

1093
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,358
what does that mean someone who's

1094
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,919
inhaling cannabis someone who's eating a

1095
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:46,559
brownie someone was putting it on there

1096
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,079
on their arthritic finger i mean there

1097
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,078
are so many ways

1098
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,800
that cannabinoids are being delivered to

1099
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,760
consumers nowadays and you can't say for

1100
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,760
certain

1101
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,599
that someone is only consuming x grams

1102
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,440
per day and if you're basing your

1103
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,318
if you're basing your maximum allowable

1104
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,400
limits on a pharmaceutical guideline

1105
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,279
which is based on the maximum dosage per

1106
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,039
day you have to define a maximum dosage

1107
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,319
in your cannabis product and they don't

1108
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,279
do that they do not do that and you i

1109
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:17,279
mean

1110
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,960
you know that's my critique of the way

1111
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,960
the regulations go

1112
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,000
is that um

1113
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,480
there's no

1114
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,199
there's no logic to the way

1115
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,760
they define the okay the regulations but

1116
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,759
for example many states

1117
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,000
even though um

1118
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,640
they you know they lump every

1119
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,119
cannabinoid or every cannabis product

1120
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:42,400
into one mode of delivery they'll say

1121
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,119
that it has to meet the inhalation pdes

1122
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,039
will work out there's no rhyme or reason

1123
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,400
why that should be the case but because

1124
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:53,279
of the lowest they feel that if they can

1125
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,720
put the lowest levels of the max lowest

1126
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,720
maximum levels

1127
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:57,679
in their specifications for those

1128
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,719
product

1129
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:03,598
if it's if it's under those levels the

1130
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:05,919
product has to be safe well that's a

1131
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,119
that's a that's that it's one of a

1132
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,079
better word that's a dumb way of

1133
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,240
regulating you know cannabis products so

1134
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,800
that's my other critique pharmaceutical

1135
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,559
pdes are based on well-established

1136
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,640
animal models they're based on delivery

1137
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,000
methods and the dates based on maximum

1138
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,559
dosages

1139
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
okay cannabis you know regulations they

1140
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,400
don't take any of that into

1141
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
consideration

1142
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,559
so we talked a little bit about sort of

1143
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,280
the different sources of contamination

1144
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:35,440
that can introduce heavy metals into

1145
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,880
cannabis you know we talked about from

1146
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,318
you know from just growing the plant

1147
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,318
whether it's accumulating it from the

1148
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:43,279
soil or the water but i wanted to get

1149
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,039
into maybe after post-harvest what are

1150
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,480
some other other ways that you know

1151
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,639
heavy metals could

1152
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,559
contaminate the plant

1153
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,480
okay um

1154
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,318
well we know based on the extraction

1155
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,719
process that different amounts of heavy

1156
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,480
metal will be extracted into whatever

1157
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,959
you're making broad spectrum full

1158
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,719
spectrum isolates and based on the

1159
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,440
extraction method whether it's co2

1160
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:09,039
whether it's alcohol whether it's butane

1161
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,960
i mean there are there's so many of them

1162
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,599
out there um

1163
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,039
there's definite and

1164
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,480
there's there's information on the

1165
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,079
public domain

1166
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,760
which talks about

1167
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,160
you have to balance

1168
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,000
efficiency of the extraction method for

1169
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:24,879
producing cannabinoids and i understand

1170
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,159
that

1171
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,680
um and extracting the minimum amount of

1172
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,000
heavy metals so

1173
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:35,440
most extractors will obviously look for

1174
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,280
efficiency and not not not be survived

1175
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,800
so much but are you extracting

1176
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,359
contaminants but i always point to

1177
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,200
gw pharmaceuticals who have their

1178
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:46,639
extraction patent in the public domain

1179
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,039
if you look at that

1180
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:51,519
and um it's complicated but it explains

1181
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,960
it very nicely that they balanced up the

1182
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,880
contaminants

1183
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,519
with efficiency of cbd that ultimately

1184
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,680
they're making cbd to make uh drugs like

1185
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,679
epidialox right they they actually have

1186
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,559
another one going through the fda

1187
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,960
pipeline which is coming out soon

1188
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,279
so they go for

1189
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,240
okay less efficiency

1190
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,560
but

1191
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,078
extracting less of the contaminants the

1192
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,279
reason they can do that

1193
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:23,599
is their growing process is all indoors

1194
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,800
all the cannabis that dw farmer grows to

1195
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,200
make epidiolex is grown indoors so

1196
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,519
they're controlling the environments

1197
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,519
very very strictly growing

1198
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,159
controlling the watering controlling the

1199
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,119
nutrient the fertilizer and everything

1200
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,159
um

1201
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:42,318
clearly many extractors in the u.s don't

1202
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,318
grow it indoors so

1203
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,480
they're not looking at that extraction

1204
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:47,679
efficiency with regard to contaminants

1205
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,280
so we know

1206
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,879
that there's probably more heavy metal

1207
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,440
contaminants coming through the

1208
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,838
extraction process which could

1209
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,240
further down the the either processing

1210
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:00,480
chain could be purified could be

1211
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,399
concentrated so you're always going to

1212
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,318
be dealing with that so then you take it

1213
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,720
through the next step and depending on

1214
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,639
what you're making um you know that's

1215
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,719
going to be in contact with

1216
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,879
things like stainless steel mixing

1217
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,480
vessels maybe grinding equipment or

1218
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,480
whatever i mean there's so many

1219
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,639
different options here of what the

1220
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,199
product could be in contact with but we

1221
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:23,039
know based on based on researchers out

1222
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:25,679
there and you know what i've uncovered

1223
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:28,480
that for example um it'll pick up

1224
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:30,960
chromium for from a from a stainless

1225
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,679
steel cutting scissors which is used to

1226
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,079
snip the buds yeah

1227
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:38,399
can you believe that yeah that's true

1228
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,839
and um now you know that surprised me

1229
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,079
but certainly in mixing vessels i mean

1230
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,838
you know chromium nickel and iron are

1231
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,880
big components of stainless steel

1232
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:48,639
obviously

1233
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,720
and if you use

1234
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,759
if you use a lot of stainless steel

1235
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,000
somewhere in the manufacturing process

1236
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,400
your product will pick up

1237
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,440
one or more of those metals

1238
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,280
and

1239
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,800
in addition to that

1240
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,560
that's going to be i mean that's going

1241
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,318
to be difficult though i mean

1242
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,000
of course us coming from the microbial

1243
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,599
side right i mean one of the advantages

1244
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,480
of stainless steel is that it's pretty

1245
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:15,680
sterile it's not going to be harboring

1246
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,119
um microbial life as well right but yeah

1247
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,000
now you have something else you need to

1248
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,519
consider

1249
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,519
yeah you know again i could point you to

1250
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,440
publications which uh which you know

1251
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,880
which have shown that and

1252
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,000
you know i think it's important to

1253
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,440
understand

1254
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,599
that um

1255
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,720
you you know many times in the

1256
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,760
processing

1257
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:37,598
in the chain of things you're doing

1258
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,200
in you know in processing the

1259
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,240
i mean whatever you're making it's not

1260
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:44,480
in contact with services for long

1261
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:46,479
periods of time but if it's stored in

1262
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,719
something and this is a this is a whole

1263
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,119
science of its own is that liquids

1264
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,439
picking up impurities from storage

1265
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,760
vessels and when i say storage vessels i

1266
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,920
mean things like glass things like

1267
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,240
plastic

1268
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,358
we know for example that borosilicate

1269
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:03,679
glass

1270
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,239
which is used a lot in the industry is

1271
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,519
notorious for having high levels

1272
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,279
okay not so much heavy metals but

1273
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,119
transition metals and some of those are

1274
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,760
heavy metals so

1275
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,720
what as a analytical chemist who uses

1276
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,599
glass

1277
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:19,838
in the process of analyzing

1278
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,480
uh anything for heavy metals you learn

1279
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:24,440
you can never use borosilicate glass you

1280
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,039
have to use either high

1281
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,200
predictor glass or quartz glass because

1282
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,838
that's the purest because you know if

1283
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:34,639
you store any acids any calibration

1284
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:36,880
standards in border silicate glass

1285
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:38,639
you'll get metals that were

1286
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,559
that are actually being leached out of

1287
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:43,358
the surface of the glass so you tend to

1288
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,440
use high purity plastics but not all

1289
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,679
plastics are high purity so you've got

1290
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,119
to be careful the type of polymer or

1291
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,118
plastic that you use

1292
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,118
there's an example recently where

1293
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,000
um

1294
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,960
a

1295
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,239
a testing lab in florida

1296
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,519
was finding

1297
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,358
over time that cbd and graduated little

1298
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:08,239
dropper bottles

1299
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:10,480
was increasing in lead level from the

1300
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:11,358
from the time that the product was made

1301
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,440
to

1302
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,440
two to three months on the shelf and

1303
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,400
what happened was that the graduated

1304
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,800
marks were made from lead-based ink

1305
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,880
so what was happening was the lead was

1306
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,200
leaching out

1307
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,039
of the ink into the extract and i'm not

1308
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,039
too sure what the extract was but this

1309
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:31,519
testing lab was finding over

1310
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,358
extended periods of time of testing it

1311
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,838
went from round about the regulated

1312
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:36,880
level which was half a ppm and in some

1313
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:40,239
cases

1314
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,680
they were getting up to 50 times higher

1315
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,318
in the extract

1316
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,639
so the stuff like this that the industry

1317
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:49,119
do they realize i think some folks do

1318
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,960
when they do anything about it not many

1319
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,920
but there are so many points along the

1320
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,679
way

1321
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,960
um where this could be happening and

1322
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,598
then you get in

1323
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,400
into delivery of the of the cannabinoid

1324
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,838
which you know when you get into the

1325
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,079
to the vaping devices which are becoming

1326
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:07,599
the delivery method of choice nowadays

1327
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,200
and um

1328
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:13,838
again uh it's scary it's scary to think

1329
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:16,558
what is happening and the industry is

1330
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:19,199
not doing a good job of trying to

1331
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,599
understand that because the process of

1332
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,279
knowing what's in the aerosol is very

1333
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,720
different to knowing what's in the

1334
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,000
liquid in the tank

1335
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,879
because the liquid in the tank is at

1336
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,719
room temperature you start heating it up

1337
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,760
elevating the temperature

1338
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,000
and then

1339
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,119
vaping it

1340
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,358
because that in itself will draw out the

1341
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,318
heavy metals which are being corroded

1342
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:44,719
and the vapor or the consumer will end

1343
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,400
up vaping small little particles of

1344
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,039
those heavy metals not just the

1345
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,280
regulated big four but we know based on

1346
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,558
a few studies out there there's not many

1347
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,240
that um

1348
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,760
there are iron particles that are

1349
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:58,159
chromium particles that are lead

1350
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,880
particles that are nickel particles and

1351
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:03,118
that's because of the components inside

1352
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,960
these vaping devices including

1353
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,880
lead-based solder you would think that

1354
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,480
wouldn't be a problem but now the

1355
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,960
industry is moving away from lead-based

1356
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,519
solder because initially it was a huge

1357
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,240
huge problem so whatever you're using

1358
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:18,480
whether it's stainless steel brass uh

1359
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:21,439
nichrome cantal there's so many

1360
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,679
different designs out there um when you

1361
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,400
increase when you start vaping at two to

1362
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,838
three hundred degrees fahrenheit

1363
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,079
you start coding the inside of the

1364
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,440
components and then it's anyone's guess

1365
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,599
how many you're getting through to the

1366
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,119
consumer

1367
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,960
wow so

1368
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,800
i mean i guess given that maybe not so

1369
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,880
much that last example that you provided

1370
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,280
though but the fact that

1371
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,599
this contamination can happen kind of

1372
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,680
throughout the supply chain here is it

1373
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,559
important that testing labs be testing

1374
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,399
sort of the final product for for these

1375
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,000
impurities because i know that that's

1376
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,160
also very state dependent like for

1377
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,519
example california that is a requirement

1378
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:02,399
you have to yeah you have to do that so

1379
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,838
absolutely yeah you know um

1380
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,440
i'm going to talk about this to many

1381
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,920
regulators because i

1382
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,079
i'm trying to convince the the regulated

1383
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,920
community and there is a national

1384
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,519
association of regulators i forgot what

1385
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,280
they're called but uh

1386
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,119
um the state regularly or one of the

1387
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,200
state regulators from maryland is is the

1388
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,440
chair of that group and she talked at an

1389
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:22,799
aoac meeting last week

1390
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,679
um

1391
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,720
and

1392
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,199
you know we talked about that it was one

1393
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:28,799
of the questions i asked her i said i

1394
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,039
need to get right i need to get the

1395
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,640
regulators to make them understand

1396
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:34,079
that this is something

1397
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,960
that they that they should be looking at

1398
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,960
seriously and being proactive in maybe

1399
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,559
trying to increase the number of

1400
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,880
elements in your state because

1401
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,800
the elements that are not being measured

1402
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,480
and not being scrutinized

1403
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,440
and we know and i've told again

1404
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,760
two to many people about this that

1405
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,679
you know cultivators are using things

1406
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,200
like nickel based salts

1407
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,279
um they are

1408
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,519
they are flower they

1409
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,599
they produce larger flowers silicon

1410
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,838
basils which make the shoot much

1411
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,039
sturdier so there's stuff going on like

1412
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:10,719
that

1413
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,239
but these elements are escaping the

1414
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:13,679
scrutiny of state regulators they're not

1415
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:14,399
being regulated

1416
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:17,598
so

1417
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,960
and i i'm not picking nickel and

1418
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,838
silicon out

1419
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,358
um

1420
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:23,119
you know for any other reason but i know

1421
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,880
that these are used

1422
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:29,680
by cultivators but you can argue that

1423
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,599
most of the nutrients and fertilizers

1424
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,440
that have been used are not high quality

1425
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,760
and most of them have been made from

1426
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,920
phosphate based fertilizers phosphate

1427
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,760
based fertilizers are notorious for

1428
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:44,318
having high levels of heavy metals so

1429
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,559
you know it's anyone's guess where what

1430
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,719
metals are being delivered from from the

1431
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,720
nutrient and the fertilizer

1432
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:54,719
into into the cannabis plant so yeah i i

1433
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:56,399
you know again um trying to get the

1434
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:59,358
attention of the industry and you know

1435
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,280
regulators are one component i've

1436
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:02,159
offered to give a talk to this

1437
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,760
um

1438
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:06,480
are you familiar with this national

1439
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:10,319
association of regulators

1440
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,800
uh yeah yeah yeah okay yeah um so um i

1441
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,960
followed up with an email to the person

1442
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,960
i

1443
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:20,799
do you know laurie

1444
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,279
uh the name does sound familiar okay

1445
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,000
yeah yeah so um

1446
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,440
i said um well okay so i asked her a

1447
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,199
question which was a little bit unfair

1448
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,960
because she couldn't really answer it

1449
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,519
that well but i said i would love to

1450
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,639
talk to your to your group about how

1451
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:36,000
maybe

1452
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:38,558
you know you know to be aware of the

1453
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,039
problem to be aware that that a lot of

1454
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,119
elements are not getting scrutinized and

1455
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,358
i think that's impacting

1456
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,200
the safety you know consumer safety i

1457
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:48,318
mean i've got to be careful what i say

1458
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,838
here because

1459
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:51,920
i you know i don't want to alarm the

1460
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,239
industry then all of a sudden

1461
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,559
that the the industry is producing

1462
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:59,039
unsafe products but i'm i'm just trying

1463
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,880
to make them aware of research that i've

1464
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:02,960
that i've done over the past two to

1465
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,119
three years which has covered a lot in

1466
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,880
my book but i followed up with

1467
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,838
publications and

1468
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,599
public speaking engagements

1469
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,400
i just think the industry should should

1470
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,200
be more aware of this that's all

1471
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,160
well

1472
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:18,239
then it's a great thing that you're

1473
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:20,399
coming to to canmed this year because

1474
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,078
we're attracting folks from all over the

1475
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,838
industry and you'll you'll definitely

1476
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,039
have a platform to yeah that's

1477
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:27,119
information

1478
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,440
but yeah i think i mean that's why i

1479
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,200
wanted to accept the invitation i

1480
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,639
you know it's a probably three or four

1481
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,639
day trip for me but

1482
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,358
um you know again you have to justify

1483
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:39,358
your time and your expenses but i think

1484
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,119
it's well worth it definitely

1485
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,039
excellent all right before i let you go

1486
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,760
rob i do want to give you a chance to

1487
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:47,759
share any additional resources with the

1488
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,119
audience that they can learn more about

1489
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,040
your work

1490
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,559
or the topic in general if you let me

1491
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:54,639
know i can put the links into the show

1492
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,760
description so that that they can learn

1493
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:57,598
more

1494
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,440
yeah i mean would i would you mind if i

1495
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,079
give you a link to my book for example

1496
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,599
absolutely okay yeah and you know let me

1497
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,920
give you links to a couple

1498
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,680
of my sort of more recent publications

1499
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,680
and that will give the audience i think

1500
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,519
a better understanding of

1501
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:14,000
where we are at the moment

1502
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:15,920
excellent and i encourage any

1503
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,838
any listeners to come out to canmed as

1504
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,920
well and listen to rob stark of course

1505
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:21,279
of course yeah please you can talk to me
