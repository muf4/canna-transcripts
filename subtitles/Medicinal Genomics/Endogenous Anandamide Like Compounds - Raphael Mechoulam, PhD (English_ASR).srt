1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,039
i'd like compounds

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,040
interesting things

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:18,800
summarized by bacharin punos

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,759
to researchers at nih in washington they

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,118
have published that modulated

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,920
endocannabinoid activity may have

7
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,559
therapeutic potential in almost all

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,760
diseases affecting humans i doubt

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,359
whether we can say this about any other

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
uh system

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,280
and that's the reason that

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
many many groups

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,799
look at the activity of endocannabinoids

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,799
all of the plant cannabinoids from

15
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,919
various

16
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,199
aspects now we have worked on three

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
different

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,680
phases types of cannabinoid research one

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,558
of them is on the plant cannabinoid

20
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,679
second one is the endocannabinoid

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,198
anatomite and 2hg and more recently over

22
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:08,319
the last few years

23
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:11,280
in additional anandamite-like compounds

24
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,438
when we started work

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,400
on the plant cannabinoids

26
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:19,118
essentially only two compounds have been

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,200
isolated it cannot be

28
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,000
diol and uh

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,640
thc cannot be known had also been seen

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,159
but i'm not sure that cannabinol is a

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,439
natural product anyway

32
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:37,040
cannabidiol as you can see here and thc

33
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:40,078
are very closely related

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
they have essentially the same structure

35
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,519
except the thc has

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,200
three rings cannabidiol as only touring

37
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,959
and they're completely completely

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,560
different in their activity while thc as

39
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:57,118
we well know causes uh

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,200
the effects that everybody associates

41
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:03,438
with cannabis cannabidiol essentially is

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,359
a compound that

43
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,118
is being used today

44
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:11,038
for a long list of medical

45
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,080
reasons

46
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,919
surprisingly the plant actually doesn't

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,879
synthesize either thc or cbd

48
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,598
it synthesizes their precursors their

49
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,560
assets we the plant synthesizes

50
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:29,759
cannabidiolic acid it synthesizes

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,239
tetrahydrocannabinolic acids as a matter

52
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,359
of fact there are two acids

53
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,239
there are two thc acid you can see here

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,040
and this depends on the uh position of

55
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,000
the carboxyl group here is the carboxyl

56
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,799
group

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,199
here in a carboxyl group here

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,719
and these compounds

59
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,878
uh are not stable they slowly

60
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:57,039
convert into

61
00:02:52,878 --> 00:03:00,079
cannabidiol from cannabidiolic acid othc

62
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,000
from thc acid

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,920
and

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
these compounds have not been

65
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,399
investigated very thoroughly because

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,560
they are not stable and scientists don't

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,800
like to work with unstable product

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,680
because we don't know whether

69
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,120
the effect seen or due to

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
the compound itself or to a degradation

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
product

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
in the body we were able recently to

73
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,798
stabilize

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,560
uh

75
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,519
cbd acid by making a metal ester and

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,479
this is

77
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,879
putting a metal group on the acid and

78
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:40,479
this and we have been able to

79
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:40,479
look at the activity of this uh

80
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,878
acid derivative

81
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,158
and together with the canadian group we

82
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,199
found that it reduces depression

83
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,399
in

84
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,719
two animal models it lowers spain with

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,599
another canadian group so this

86
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,759
particular compound which is present in

87
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,959
quite large amounts in

88
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,199
in

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,000
in cannabis in the plant

90
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,679
is of considerable interest and i assume

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,318
that it will be used

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,719
uh for one of these

93
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,798
the effects that we we see whether it's

94
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,798
depression or whether it's pain

95
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,519
most of the work that has been published

96
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,559
actually is of course not on the asked

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,720
but on cannabidiol itself i will

98
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,680
not go into details there are

99
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,919
hundreds of papers on cbd action

100
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,519
basically it works on information and

101
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,519
epilepsy and diabetes type one

102
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,560
on graph versus crohn's disease a few

103
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,959
works

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,199
on epilepsy we

105
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,439
did in collaboration with the group in

106
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,280
south america some

107
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,199
initially work on

108
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,799
mice and rats and we saw that it is

109
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,079
pretty

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
active in

111
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,240
models of epilepsy in

112
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,679
these animal models

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,199
and then we went into a

114
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
clinical study

115
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,960
we had 15 epileptic patients that were

116
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,519
not being helped by the existing drugs

117
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,680
at that time they received two to three

118
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,399
hundred milligrams per day of

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,918
cannabidiol for quite a long time four

120
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,359
and a half months

121
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,758
and

122
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,199
my colleagues in south america founded

123
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,479
patients

124
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,038
out of eight

125
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,199
remained completely free of seizures

126
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,839
three patients had partial improvement

127
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,840
and only one patient had no improvement

128
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,719
with the placebo patients of course we

129
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,439
saw

130
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,520
essentially no no change

131
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,759
this was published

132
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,038
as you can see the date here

133
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:51,360
about 40 years ago but nothing happened

134
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:53,839
for nearly 30 years we could have helped

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,400
a lot of epileptic patients over these

136
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,758
uh 30 years but about

137
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,439
10 or 12 years ago

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,120
additional groups

139
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,879
got interested and a major clinical

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,439
trial was done

141
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,879
by a british

142
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,600
company

143
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,279
the trial was done in the us and they

144
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,759
found that

145
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,279
it is indeed

146
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,479
very active

147
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,879
in

148
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,918
certain epilepsy states so and

149
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,360
now

150
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,478
cbd has been approved as a drug for

151
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,000
certain

152
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,639
epileptic conditions

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,199
i also mentioned graft versus hose

154
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,840
disease well this is uh

155
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,960
actually a disease caused by

156
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,000
by medicine there are certain diseases

157
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,719
where

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,639
bone marrow transplant is needed

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,000
and it is

160
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,879
very helpful in certain cancer diseases

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,519
but

162
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,279
it may cause

163
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,079
problems

164
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,918
the bone marrow transplant can attack

165
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,918
the body the body can attack

166
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:12,240
the bone marrow and the patient is sick

167
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,400
at times very sick

168
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,199
a colleague of mine

169
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,839
dr yeshua at one of the hospitals she

170
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
administered cbd

171
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,478
to

172
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:27,839
as you can see here 46 patients that had

173
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:30,719
a bone marrow transplant and he followed

174
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,959
them for several months and he saw

175
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
very very substantial

176
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,519
improvement

177
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,400
and they had essentially

178
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,279
no

179
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,478
graft versus hose disease so i suppose

180
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,959
that

181
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,839
cannabidiol will become a drug not only

182
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,198
for

183
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:52,000
cbd and for epilepsy but also for

184
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,639
uh graft versus hose disease as a matter

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,639
of fact probably of uh quite a few other

186
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,240
diseases as well

187
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,199
what about thc again i will not i

188
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,400
will not go into detail but basically

189
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:10,639
what dhc does it lowers pain

190
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,399
it is used and approved actually uh for

191
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,240
nausea and vomiting

192
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,318
it helps with sleep and many of

193
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
those patients that take

194
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,919
thc

195
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:25,279
actually take it in order to improve

196
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:29,120
sleep or to make sleep possible

197
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,478
it at low doses it is an anti-anxiety

198
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,519
compound but

199
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:36,080
as we all know at high doses we can see

200
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,599
completely different effects and it also

201
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,759
increases appetite

202
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,519
so for nearly

203
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,278
20 years since we

204
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,278
reported the structures of these

205
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,519
compounds structures which were not

206
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,320
known previously

207
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,039
for

208
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,600
20 or 25 years there was a lot of

209
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,079
pharmacological work on these two

210
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,360
compounds and we learned from them a lot

211
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,560
about

212
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,919
the effects of cannabinoids and

213
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,439
hundreds

214
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:10,399
of papers were published on them one

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,040
thing that we did not know

216
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
for many years was the mechanism of

217
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,439
action of thc

218
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,759
how does thc act

219
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,680
uh a group in the u.s

220
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,399
in the 80s found

221
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,319
that

222
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,399
there is a specific cannabinoid receptor

223
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,360
in the brain and this specific

224
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,799
cannabinoid receptor in the brain is

225
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,800
found in

226
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,759
a

227
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,879
brain

228
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:41,200
areas that are really typical for the

229
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,039
effect that we see this is found in the

230
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,320
basal ganglia

231
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,199
that has

232
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
a lot to do with movement control

233
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,000
it has

234
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,120
it has been found in the cerebellum in

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,839
the hippocampus in the cerebral cortex

236
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,600
and as a matter of fact the res this

237
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,600
particular receptor

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,839
cb1 is one of the major receptors that

239
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,240
we see

240
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,760
uh in the brain in our body not only in

241
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,799
the brain

242
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,799
um

243
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,919
well we assume that

244
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,399
if

245
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,360
there is a receptor

246
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,639
it is not there because a plant produces

247
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,600
thc

248
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,720
uh just we assume that

249
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,839
our body produces compounds

250
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,440
which uh activate

251
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,279
this receptor

252
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,760
by

253
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:37,120
for some peculiar reason a plant

254
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,879
compound binds to the same receptor

255
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,959
so we worked

256
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,720
for quite a few years actually

257
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,559
and we found

258
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
in

259
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,439
1992

260
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,639
uh more than

261
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,600
20 years ago 25 years ago we found a new

262
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,919
compound which we call the nanobite that

263
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,519
has a structure which is completely

264
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:02,240
different from that of dhc yet

265
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,519
this compound binds

266
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,839
to the receptor today known as the cb1

267
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,039
receptor to the same extent

268
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,519
as tetrahydrocannabinol

269
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,078
a few years later we found the second

270
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,360
compound which is closely related to

271
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:22,559
anandamide and it also binds to the

272
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,800
receptor these two compounds have been

273
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,639
investigated

274
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:31,599
thoroughly by many many groups and these

275
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,159
two compounds as i mentioned previously

276
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,440
are involved in a large number of

277
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,439
biological systems

278
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,399
they are part of today we know of the

279
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:43,278
endocannabinoid

280
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,799
system

281
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,838
which is

282
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,879
which consists of two receptors a second

283
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,959
receptor was found a few years later

284
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,559
than the previous one there are two

285
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:59,838
receptors that the two major compounds

286
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,919
anandamite and 2ag that i showed you the

287
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,760
structures previously there are a few

288
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
other compounds found in

289
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,078
lower amounts which have not been

290
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,240
investigated thoroughly but it seems

291
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:13,199
that these two compounds which we

292
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,680
discovered in the 1990s anandamite and

293
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,200
2ag they are the main

294
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,519
compounds involved in the

295
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,560
endocannabinoid system of course the

296
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,240
enzymes that synthesize

297
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:27,439
endocannabinoids and the enzymes because

298
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,600
the hydrolysis of the endocannabinoids

299
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,279
so these

300
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,278
the compounds and the enzyme

301
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,200
today are known as the endocannabinoid

302
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,799
system because

303
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,800
thc and cannabidar are closely involved

304
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,319
now what are the

305
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,439
effects

306
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
that we

307
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
see

308
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,958
that are due to the cannabinoid system

309
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,359
we know today and there are lots of

310
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,439
publications and i possibly can have a

311
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,560
few more slides

312
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,040
uh i'm just giving a few of uh the

313
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,759
effect that we know this

314
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,559
this system is involved in anxiety and

315
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,919
appetite and all these uh

316
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,119
that you can see

317
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,360
this slide

318
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,720
uh mood movement neuro protection pain

319
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,440
stress etc etc

320
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,360
i'll just give a few examples neural

321
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,360
protection

322
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
in collaboration with a

323
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,480
colleague of mine

324
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,759
professor shahami

325
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,600
we

326
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:38,000
try to see what happens in the brain

327
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
after

328
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,839
damage not a major damage by but a small

329
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,720
amount smaller damage

330
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
and

331
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,959
we saw that uh

332
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,679
after the

333
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,439
such a damage the mouse

334
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,879
the brain of the mouse

335
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,480
produces

336
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,879
two ag

337
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,240
in very large amount you can see here

338
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,600
the red bull

339
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,839
which

340
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,079
you can compare with the control

341
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,519
huge amounts of 2ag

342
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:17,519
are synthesized by the brain

343
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,839
does the brain produce 2ag because

344
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,198
it has been damaged and

345
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:27,120
doesn't know what it does or is

346
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,120
the production of 2ag

347
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,039
actually a response a protective

348
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:36,638
response perhaps about the brain

349
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,439
so we synthesized large amounts of uag

350
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,120
and

351
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
gave it to mice

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,679
that had undergone brain damage and

353
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,639
compared them to myself and not

354
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:50,559
undergoing that damage and we saw that

355
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,198
2ag when administered to

356
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,319
the mount to the mice

357
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:59,679
lowers the damage seen

358
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,160
here you can look at the brains

359
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,879
of mice that have received luigi

360
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,399
compared to control animals and we can

361
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,759
see that

362
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,799
the

363
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,439
damage

364
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,439
in the controls is

365
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
uh 50

366
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,720
higher than those that can

367
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,159
that received to a g

368
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,278
so chances are that at some point i hope

369
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,600
some company will develop 2ag as a

370
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,078
compound against brain damage

371
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,320
i don't believe that we have any

372
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,758
drugs

373
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,000
in this area at the moment

374
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,560
i mentioned that there are two receptors

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,600
one of them the cb1

376
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,278
when

377
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,839
uh thc or nandamite bind to

378
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,120
the cb1 receptor they

379
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,920
uh

380
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,198
lead to those effects that we are

381
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,838
we know the

382
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,278
associated with

383
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,720
with cannabis

384
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:03,600
cb2 by contrast doesn't do all these

385
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,079
things the cb2 receptor seems to be a

386
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,680
protective one a compound

387
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,198
receptor that when stimulated actually

388
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,838
is

389
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,479
leads to protection and the protection

390
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,440
being can be in various areas

391
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,039
there are papers on a protection of

392
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,759
brain pro of

393
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,679
heart problems

394
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,240
atherosclerosis stroke liver fibrosis

395
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,120
etc etc

396
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,600
and i'm under the impression that

397
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,519
several of the major companies

398
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,360
are working on specific cb2 receptor

399
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,399
compounds

400
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,079
as

401
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,958
for specific

402
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:47,838
diseases and it is we and many others

403
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:50,719
have published compounds which act

404
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,800
on the cb2 receptor alone and here are

405
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,160
two examples from my lab

406
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:58,639
and one of them

407
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:00,799
is the hua2 hebrew university hu308

408
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,000
which you can see

409
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,198
binds

410
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,480
very well to the cb2 receptor but does

411
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,120
not bind

412
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,078
to the cb1 receptor or the second

413
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,159
compound which is a different one which

414
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:18,399
is hu910

415
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:23,120
binds to the cb2 receptor extremely well

416
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,120
and rather poorly to the cb1 receptor

417
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,519
i mentioned brain injury

418
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,319
and

419
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:35,279
in brain injury we see quite a lot of

420
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:38,159
different types of damage

421
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,160
one type is

422
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,360
has to do with glutamate cytokines

423
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,160
reactive oxygen intermediates and this

424
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,038
can

425
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,679
lead to cell death

426
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,279
another type of damage is vessel

427
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,240
constriction

428
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,240
and we

429
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,080
tested 2ag to see whether it has to do

430
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,000
with vasoconstriction and i mentioned

431
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,038
2ag because we saw

432
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,839
some one of the previous slides that 2ag

433
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,798
is helpful in brain damage and yes

434
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,759
indeed

435
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:15,200
it helps with vasoconstriction uh

436
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,558
it lowers the vasoconstriction

437
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,360
in the brain

438
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,399
however and we were surprised really

439
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,558
however

440
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,840
the total extract

441
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,960
of the brain was much better than 2eg

442
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,959
alone

443
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,319
so we assumed maybe

444
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,240
we have

445
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:35,839
another compound much more active

446
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,558
compound than 2ag which which works on

447
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,279
the

448
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,720
vasoconstriction by the dilation

449
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,879
and

450
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,839
a student of mine in it is phd on this

451
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,919
topic

452
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:52,000
looked for compounds or a compound that

453
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,160
is better than 2hg

454
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,720
in

455
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,720
vasodilation

456
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,480
and after quite a few years

457
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,200
of work

458
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:06,000
we were able to identify a compound

459
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,279
compound the structure that we isolated

460
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,038
and elucidated the structure it is uh

461
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,399
our hidonia serine it is very close to

462
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,720
anatomite

463
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,240
they both compounds

464
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,279
are derivatives of arachidonic acid this

465
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
here is the arachidonic acid

466
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,879
both are

467
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,360
bind to

468
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,400
in this case ethanol amine and in this

469
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,479
case exactly the same but

470
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,280
with a carboxyl group

471
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,200
here essentially the same compound is an

472
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,160
endomite but

473
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,120
arasa hidonovial serine

474
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,240
does not bind to the receptors

475
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:51,678
and is much more potent than endomite

476
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,599
in the vasoconstriction

477
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,960
uh and you can see that the three

478
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,240
compounds

479
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,200
the anatomized the two ag and rs are

480
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,798
achieved in serine ras very closely

481
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,919
related but

482
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,679
they have

483
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,038
uh different activities

484
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,640
i mentioned head trauma so we looked at

485
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,839
a few

486
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,240
additional compounds present in

487
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:22,319
in the brain that may act on brain

488
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,839
trauma and we have and we found that rs

489
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,439
as i mentioned the rs previously

490
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,879
is

491
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,038
pretty good in lowering brain trauma it

492
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,080
is as active as 2ag

493
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:39,119
surprisingly two very closely related

494
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,038
compounds also present in the brain

495
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,678
are essentially

496
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,679
inactive

497
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,200
this particular compound rise

498
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,480
the wheel

499
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,440
the serine the dimension

500
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,159
possesses vasoactive and neuroprotective

501
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,840
properties resembling those of the

502
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,320
cannabinoids but as i mentioned again

503
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,959
it does not bind to the cannabinoid

504
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,399
receptors i'm not sure how these things

505
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,600
work together

506
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,240
as i believe the neural protection with

507
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:20,719
the cannabinoids with the nandomite has

508
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:24,079
to do with the cb1 and cb2 but ras does

509
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,798
not so here we may have two different

510
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,720
mechanisms leading to the same type of

511
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,558
effects

512
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,880
let me go to another

513
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:32,879
um

514
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,170
field

515
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,359
which cannabinoids are involved

516
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,359
[Music]

517
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,440
it has been published

518
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,759
and

519
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,000
there are several papers on this that in

520
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:51,359
greece greek peasants

521
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,599
seem to have less osteoporosis

522
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,599
than

523
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,798
presence in other places

524
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,038
in in the north in norway in

525
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:06,960
germany in sweden

526
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:08,240
and we wanted to know why this happens

527
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
and we

528
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
found

529
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:15,678
that

530
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:18,320
the bone has contains a compound

531
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,679
it is also present in the brain all in

532
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,798
serine which promotes osteoclast

533
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,559
apoptosis and increases bone formation

534
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,240
let me explain

535
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,359
the bones we have

536
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,880
do not stay the way they are for

537
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:37,439
throughout our life

538
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:40,400
they are broken down all the time by a

539
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,400
south coast osteoclast and there are at

540
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
the same time

541
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,960
being rebuilt

542
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,919
by osteoblasts

543
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,319
[Music]

544
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,720
certain diseases osteoporosis for

545
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,359
example the osteoclasts

546
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,079
work

547
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,399
overtime if you wish and

548
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,319
the osteoblast cannot

549
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,080
promote enough

550
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,519
bone formation

551
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:10,319
if only serine was found to

552
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:13,279
lower the effect of osteoplast it causes

553
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:16,158
apoptosis and in this way

554
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:19,200
there is less breaking down of the bone

555
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,640
and more a bone formation

556
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
and

557
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,520
you can see here again this is

558
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
anandamide and here is the only in

559
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,200
serine

560
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,559
which acts on bones and which causes

561
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,880
lowering of the

562
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:38,798
effects of the osteoclast

563
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,480
and it seems to be pretty good in

564
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:43,278
osteoporosis

565
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,919
so another colleague of mine

566
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,359
the late professor bob

567
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,759
looked at

568
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,719
the activity of

569
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,720
oleosyrin

570
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,360
he caused

571
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,798
osteoporosis and osteoporosis like

572
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,319
disease

573
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,679
by

574
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:10,399
causing ovaryectomy in female mice

575
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:13,120
and indeed if one causes ovary ectomy uh

576
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,360
and looks at the mice after about 40

577
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,439
days we see

578
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,839
that the bones are

579
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,840
the

580
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,278
bone content goes down

581
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,839
but if we start giving

582
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,440
only serine at this point

583
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,119
we can see now

584
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,600
that the bones not

585
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,319
do not continue breaking down does the

586
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,439
matter of fact

587
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,678
recover

588
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,840
now most of the drugs that we have of

589
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:47,360
osteoporosis nowadays

590
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,839
usually just stop the disease or they

591
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,719
stop to a certain extent the disease

592
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,599
very few of the drugs if any at all

593
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,079
cause

594
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,079
the formation of the bone again

595
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:04,720
there are quite a few diseases known

596
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,400
that have that are closely related to

597
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,720
osteoporosis there is a disease

598
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,240
called prada willis syndrome

599
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,360
which causes bone abnormalities

600
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,519
they are

601
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,359
closely related to osteoporosis of

602
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:21,359
course the plant and wheelie symptoms

603
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,199
has a lot of other effects but i'm

604
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,918
speaking of the bones alone

605
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,919
and um

606
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,278
it it was found

607
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,000
that uh

608
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,200
in

609
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,480
prader-willi syndrome we have the body

610
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,880
produces

611
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,679
lower amounts of olive theory

612
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,960
so

613
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,400
when

614
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
my colleague

615
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,278
jose tom

616
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,519
who is a specialist in this area started

617
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:53,599
administering only syrian two

618
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,960
animals that have the plan of willie

619
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,199
syndrome

620
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,600
they most definitely

621
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,600
caused

622
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,759
enhancement upon formation and

623
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:09,079
improvement of the

624
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,079
bone disease

625
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,360
now all these compounds i mentioned all

626
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,480
these anandamite like compounds i

627
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,240
mentioned

628
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,079
are

629
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,480
not very stable

630
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:26,079
they're all of them are amis that can be

631
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,038
attacked by amidases and therefore i

632
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:31,519
doubt whether they can be used as drugs

633
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,798
on their own so we

634
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,278
prepared

635
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:40,278
a few derivatives that wouldn't go into

636
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,278
the chemistry one of them is the a2671

637
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,879
in which the mite bond is kind of

638
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,200
protected

639
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,039
and the enzyme

640
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,480
does not attack it as easily as in

641
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,359
the compounds i

642
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,079
mentioned only serine for example and

643
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:01,439
indeed 678

644
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:04,720
exhibits high efficacy inversing

645
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:09,200
reversing the osteoporosis and it is

646
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:12,079
active in the prada willie syndrome

647
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,038
let me move to another field

648
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:18,639
one of the major problems we have

649
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:20,640
in medicine today is that many of the

650
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,159
microbes we have

651
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,799
uh have

652
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,480
antibiotic resistance

653
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:27,839
and if

654
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,159
we don't

655
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,839
we we cannot overcome this major problem

656
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,240
we

657
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:39,759
should probably be back

658
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,519
as if we were in the 1930s with microbes

659
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,038
that we cannot

660
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,960
attack by antibiotics

661
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,960
we try to see

662
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,480
whether our body

663
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,200
has a way

664
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,159
to work against

665
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,080
this

666
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,720
microbial resistance

667
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,639
and after quite a lot of work which was

668
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,679
done

669
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,120
in the lab professor turnbull in

670
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,960
collaboration

671
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,479
we found that

672
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,000
methicillin an antibiotic

673
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,000
which

674
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,679
against which certain staphylococci

675
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,599
streptococci

676
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,159
they have become resistant

677
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,158
we can

678
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,240
enhance the activity of the

679
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,839
antibiotic

680
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,359
if we give the antibiotic together with

681
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,199
anandamide or aras the same compound

682
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,398
then mentioned previously our

683
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,679
arachidonial serine

684
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,439
and

685
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,120
we found that

686
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,278
rs

687
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,918
really can overcome

688
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,679
the microbial resistance of these

689
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,120
particular

690
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,960
microbes

691
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,119
we are looking at many additional

692
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,759
microbes at the moment we're looking at

693
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,558
additional compounds but this may be a

694
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,079
very promising field

695
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:10,480
or promising

696
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:12,558
way of overcoming microbial resistance

697
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,839
and here again is

698
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:19,200
an undermined 2eg and rs which i

699
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:22,240
mentioned uh previously

700
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,360
what is the mechanism how does uh rs do

701
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,839
that

702
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,158
well

703
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,759
when microbes

704
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,080
are attacked by

705
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:35,200
an antibiotic one of the

706
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,519
ways they can

707
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,038
resist is by

708
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,599
producing a biofilm millions of

709
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:47,200
microbes get together they form a

710
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,199
biofilm which is not

711
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:53,119
attacked by

712
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:55,839
by the antibiotics the ris

713
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:58,239
prevents the biofilm formation

714
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,199
by altering the surface of the cell

715
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,919
without actually killing them by the

716
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,919
bacteria

717
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:09,359
and let me end

718
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:14,158
with a completely different field

719
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,158
the field of nicotine addiction

720
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:23,519
uh quite a few people that smoke

721
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,440
cigarettes or other types of tobacco

722
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,200
become addicted

723
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,399
to

724
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,720
nicotine

725
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:33,359
and this addiction

726
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,079
causes them to smoke although they know

727
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,879
that

728
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,319
smoking is not good for them

729
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,600
and

730
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:44,558
we wanted to see whether our body has a

731
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:48,240
way of

732
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:49,200
preventing lowering this

733
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,798
type of

734
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,440
this addiction

735
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:56,000
we found a paper in the literature

736
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,960
that a person who was involved in a

737
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,919
traffic accident and was addicted to

738
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,440
nicotine after the traffic accident

739
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,960
which he had a

740
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,798
brain trauma he was not addicted anymore

741
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,120
so we thought maybe

742
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:15,759
just maybe the brain is producing a

743
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:19,359
compound that blocks the addiction

744
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,240
and so we

745
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,079
looked

746
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,679
forward

747
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:28,558
and we found a compound which again

748
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,880
is very closely related to an endomite

749
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,278
it is a fatty acid it is a fatty

750
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,880
fantastic bound

751
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:35,919
to

752
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,799
uh

753
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:43,038
uh this part here to this forming amide

754
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,038
and

755
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:52,720
a colleague of uh of ours in the

756
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,720
uk in canada went ahead looking whether

757
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,159
this compound indeed you know those

758
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,960
models of

759
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,880
addiction is active as a matter of fact

760
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,120
and i want to stress this again i

761
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,200
mentioned several times that i work with

762
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,439
colleagues all my work is done in

763
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,519
collaboration with

764
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,480
friends and colleagues in this case in

765
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,839
the field of addiction we are a group of

766
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,038
four

767
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:21,199
labs in addition to my own lab a lab in

768
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:23,200
the u.s a lab in canada and lab in italy

769
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,319
and we work together

770
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,399
and

771
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,839
the lab in

772
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:32,719
italy actually found a compound

773
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:37,278
from from a brain and the group in

774
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,278
canada worked on the addiction process

775
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,599
dr parker a canadian

776
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,080
looked at the conditional place

777
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,158
preference in an animal model of

778
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,439
addiction a conditional phrase

779
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,919
preference

780
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,320
is a relatively simple

781
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,519
way of measuring addiction

782
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,200
mice or rats are given

783
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,679
the option to

784
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,159
uh go to

785
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,960
food with or or go to food with

786
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,399
nicotine at the beginning they go 50 to

787
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,798
one part of two to the nicotine

788
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,558
uh containing food

789
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,319
and fifty percent

790
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:21,200
the food it did not does not contain

791
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,319
nicotine well after uh

792
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,319
some

793
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,240
day so

794
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:30,079
probably some weeks

795
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:34,159
they are addicted to the nicotine and

796
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,158
almost all of them go to

797
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,079
the nicotine

798
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,599
with food and that's called conditional

799
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,278
place preference

800
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:44,639
and

801
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,960
linda parker in canada found that if we

802
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,159
give the compound we discovered in the

803
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,840
brain

804
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,840
the mice do not get addicted and

805
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,278
they

806
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,918
they found that

807
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,278
the condition placed preference works

808
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,320
absolutely

809
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:09,280
in this case

810
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:11,440
we thought that it might work also with

811
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,919
opiates well we were kind of

812
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,240
disappointed to see that uh only that

813
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,358
olympic glycine does not work with

814
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,479
opiates

815
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,039
but

816
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,639
again surprisingly it was both the

817
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:29,279
nicotine and opiate withdrawal responses

818
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,639
we know that

819
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,879
animals

820
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,039
of course human

821
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,918
humans that are addicted they can

822
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:41,918
undergo withdrawal responses which

823
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,279
sometimes are very very uh

824
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,118
unpleasant

825
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,879
and we found that

826
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,599
only glycine eliminates both nicotine

827
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,838
and opiate withdrawal responses which is

828
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,159
kind of strange because only glycine

829
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,679
does not work on

830
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,358
opiate addiction

831
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,039
but it turned out that

832
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,960
withdrawal and the addiction there are

833
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,159
two different

834
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,440
types of

835
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:11,279
response and today we know that olive

836
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,519
glycine works on nicotine addiction does

837
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,839
not work in opioid addiction but it

838
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,400
works on nicotine and opiate we do all

839
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:18,400
symptoms

840
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,519
and here is

841
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:28,480
what linda parker wrote morphine

842
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,480
withdrawal reactions were accompanied by

843
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,159
suppressed endogenous levels of

844
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,599
polyglycine

845
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,799
in

846
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,920
different parts of the brain

847
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,320
well only glycine as uh is again an

848
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,079
amide and as i mentioned before

849
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,680
mites can be easily attacked by

850
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,920
amidazes

851
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,039
so we decided to

852
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,480
again

853
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,000
try to

854
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,240
suppress this

855
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,358
enzyme reaction by

856
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,799
having a metal group not far from the mi

857
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,920
and so we

858
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,400
they

859
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,039
synthesize the compound this is polyel

860
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,240
glycine and this is an oreo glycine with

861
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:14,960
a metal group so it becomes alanine

862
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:17,838
only only ill alanine and this compound

863
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,119
turned out to be more active

864
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:23,679
for a longer period and then early

865
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,519
inflation itself

866
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,358
so

867
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,119
we found that only

868
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,799
alanine is not only

869
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,559
most stable but it's also more potent

870
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,480
anti-withdrawal molecule than only

871
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,559
glycine and i

872
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,599
am under the impression that

873
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:44,000
this compound may or should become a

874
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,000
drug

875
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,439
well as i mentioned before on the basis

876
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,239
of what i've been telling you we assume

877
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,599
that the exogenous administration olive

878
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,838
of oil glycine or all in alanine may be

879
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,160
beneficial for the prevention of

880
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,159
nicotine addiction and nicotine and

881
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,719
opiate withdrawal

882
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,799
well let me summarize

883
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,759
what i've been um

884
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,440
talking about the can of

885
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,079
endocannabinoids are involved in a large

886
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,320
number of physiological processes

887
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,320
and thc

888
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,599
which is a plant cannabinoid just mimics

889
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,760
their actions

890
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,880
cbd derivatives may lead to wide

891
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,400
spectrum of novel drugs

892
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,119
endocannabinoid-like compounds may lead

893
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:35,440
to better understanding of biological

894
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,920
processes as well as novel drugs and cb2

895
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,358
specific avenues may lead to a wide

896
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,159
spectrum of normal drug maybe part of a

897
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,480
general protective system and i want to

898
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:50,559
thank to thank my collaboration

899
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,559
collaborators in israel these are

900
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,920
fellows in my lab

901
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,920
uh there are many other

902
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,720
labs that are professors in jerusalem

903
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,400
that i collaborate i mentioned my work

904
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,279
with professor obama professor shohami

905
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,119
and

906
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,560
some in other

907
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,200
academic

908
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,440
institutes in israel and i work with a

909
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,719
lot of

910
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,880
