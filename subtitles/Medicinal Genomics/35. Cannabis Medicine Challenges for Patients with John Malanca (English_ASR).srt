ever-changing industry

at canmed 2021 john will moderate a

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640
panel of medical cannabis experts to

74
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,439
discuss and answer some of the reasons

75
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:18,399
why cannabis is essential to wellness

76
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,919
and not a one-size-fits-all medicine

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,239
during our conversation you will hear

78
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,199
the powerful story that brought medical

79
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,360
cannabis into john's family's life as we

80
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,598
explore the challenges patients face

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,920
when beginning cannabis treatment

82
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,079
we also discuss how the cannabis

83
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,598
medicine landscape has changed over the

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,959
last 10 years

85
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,479
the fact that cannabis medicine is not a

86
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,039
one-size-fits-all medicine and treatment

87
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,959
needs to be personalized to each patient

88
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,280
the limited guidance many patients

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,759
receive from medical providers when it

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,680
comes to cannabis medicines the limited

91
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,318
education most health care providers

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,239
have on the endocannabinoid system how

93
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,359
patients can navigate through the number

94
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,438
of cannabis products and more

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
before we get to my conversation with

96
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,519

114
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,839
good afternoon john thank you for

115
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
joining us on the podcast

116
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,638
i'm doing great and i want to thank you

117
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
first for for being a part of canmed

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,759
this year and moderating our medical

119
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,680
panel it's going to be a great talk and

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,720
a lot of it's going to be about patient

121
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,759
education which is a great topic because

122
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,160
i think we at canmed and on the podcast

123
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,400
we talk so much about how cannabis and

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,320
cannabinoid therapies can help people

125
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,079
and the research that's going into it

126
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,560
and that we sometimes forget how

127
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,120
difficult it can be for patients to put

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,360
that information into practice

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,000
with that said i was hoping you could

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,160
share your story of how you got involved

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,240
with cannabis medicine because i think

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
it's a nice place to start and it

133
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
dovetails nicely into exploring the

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,680
topic of patient education

135
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,960
yeah first off thank you for you and

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,038
your team for even considering me and uh

137
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,159
and uh having me on

138
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:57,279
not only on your show here but also

139
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,880
to lead emcee the panel which

140
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,599
you know i've been in this industry for

141
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,079
quite some time and those are colleagues

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,319
that i've worked with for the past 10 11

143
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,719
years and so it was exciting when uh

144
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,039
when that opportunity came up but how we

145
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,440
came into you know cannabis

146
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,360
i'm 54 years old you know and so you

147
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,800
know i had you know cannabis was part of

148
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,160
my life in high school and in college

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,879
and i stopped

150
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
at 21 and it's funny i run into

151
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,360
buddies from the old days and they're

152
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:28,159
like oh nothing has changed i'm like no

153
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,000
there there was a whole gap in between

154
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,840
there but uh in 2000 um

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,439
uh my background has been in branding

156
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,959
marketing advertising for years work for

157
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:41,120
travel websites and and magazines and i

158
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,478
was constantly on the road and my wife

159
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,680
was like come on babe we got to do

160
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,279
something that

161
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,038
keeps you home because she was always on

162
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:52,478
the road with me and we were coming by a

163
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:54,000
uh uh this is 2008 2009 we were driving

164
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,719
by a

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,478
conference that had medical cannabis cup

166
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,479
and i don't think it was the high times

167
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,079
it was something else at the time and i

168
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:03,439
said pull over and i called her mary

169
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,680
poppins because she didn't drink didn't

170
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,279
smoke worked out i mean everything and

171
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,478
she what are we doing she had just

172
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,239
picked me up at the airport and i said

173
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,199
pull over and so we went over it went in

174
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,800
there and over there everyone was

175
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,478
setting up it was a friday saturday

176
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,240
sunday but you know everyone was setting

177
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,758
up friday night and we walked through

178
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,079
there and we met some cool people just

179
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,479
setting up and we got back in the car we

180
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,598
said how is this medical

181
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,120
you know how was this medical there

182
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:30,399
wasn't anything medical in there and

183
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,000
so our brain brain started going and we

184
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,239
said let's do something

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,959
for medical

186
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,120
and we started brainstorming we met a

187
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,038
web design web developer and we started

188
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,399
putting some things together and then

189
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,159
out of the blue

190
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,318
my father-in-law was super bowl sunday i

191
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
was outside barbecuing and he comes up

192
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
and he says

193
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,800
i have something to share with you and i

194
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,400
said what's that thinking he and my

195
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
mother-in-law

196
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,638
bought a winnebago or

197
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,720
traveling or do something he said

198
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,000
i have lung cancer and that's like what

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,360
and he hadn't smoked just show you the

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
repercussions that i think he hadn't

201
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,000
smoked in 20 or 30 years just show you

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,280
the repercussions of cigarette smoke i

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,720
said we need to oh don't worry i'm going

204
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,399
to go in they'll take care of it well he

205
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,160
did do a round of chemo radiation and

206
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,120
then knocked him on his butt and he went

207
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,280
from a healthy 77 year old man to

208
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,800
looking like a prisoner of war 24 7

209
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,638
oxygen and just

210
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,199
just

211
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
wilting away i should say and about a

212
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,319
year and a half prior to that or

213
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,879
probably about a year prior to that my

214
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,439
father passed away not from cancer

215
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,918
and so i was just an emotional wreck one

216
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,519
now they had never experienced uh

217
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,120
passing in their family

218
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,679
her my queen's grandparents were still

219
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,440
alive at night they passed at 98 97 and

220
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,120
they've been together since age 16 so

221
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,399
isn't that a and that what's life

222
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
supposed to be

223
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,320
so

224
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,879
um

225
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,640
he went back in after treating his lung

226
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,278
cancer and it turned out metastasized to

227
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,519
his brain and so he has a double whammy

228
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,600
and now they've given him two weeks to

229
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,200
live we said i said may i go into your

230
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,639
next oncology appointment wheeled him in

231
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,959
with oxygen tanks

232
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,639
like i said he was just wilting away and

233
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,559
we asked the oncologist how much time do

234
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,679
we have and she looked at us in shock

235
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,958
and said

236
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,559
you know

237
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,958
really and he said this is my family and

238
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,159
she said probably two weeks and through

239
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,518
tears

240
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,480
i said there has to be something she

241
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,639
said i can give you morphine

242
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,320
and he said i'm not in any pain and i

243
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,159
looked at corinne and i looked at my

244
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,278
in-laws and i was a stupid boyfriend

245
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,719
then i wasn't

246
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,480
the husband yet

247
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
so i said

248
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,519
i don't mean to offend you because it

249
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
was popping up all over california all

250
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
these dispensaries and i just said

251
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,360
and karen and i had come across a study

252
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,240
that showed 40 of cancer patients

253
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,600

254
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
over same thing with age patients

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120

256
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,278

as as the conversation goes on

300
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,639
and crin life came across in the only

301
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,720
reason we went this way

302
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,399
we found a coconut oil capsule is an

303
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,320
oil-based capsule and the only reason we

304
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,000
went this way we knew we could freeze it

305
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,200
and cut it into slivers

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,958
you know there was no labeling on it

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,079
wouldn't say one dose back in those days

308
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,599
it was a

309
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,559
you know one dose but it was enough to

310
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,720
fill i would say to to feed a uh nfl

311
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,639
football team you know and so

312
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,720
came back it was a 10 milligram capsule

313
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,559
we froze it just cut into slivers

314
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,639
just prayed and hoped that it would

315
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,559
something would work

316
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,078
within 24 hours

317
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,199

335
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,519
morning we called do we make it through

336
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,120
the night and we went over there day 8

337
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,200
and we go over there and he's shuffling

338
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,278
around the house and

339
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,120
i said don't get too cocky he said well

340
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,360
i have energy you know that's part of

341
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,679
what we said great he'll pass peacefully

342
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,200
and i'll fast forward this

343
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,799
and still he would just take the three

344
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,040
milligrams

345
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,479
every morning just in that capsule

346
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,039
he started functioning

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,440
and he's now he's walking and at six

348
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,599
months hospice fires him as a patient

349
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,079
because he's walking he's driving he's

350
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,519
swinging a golf club they were traveling

351
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,599
and we said i'll be darn and so we

352
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,480
started doing a lot of research about

353
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,560
this miraculous plant

354
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,440
and we started at that point we had said

355
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,078
to halt to our graph or our web

356
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,279
designers let's don't do this let's do a

357
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,278
build a website that people can come to

358
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,759
get information

359
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,799
get guidance see clinical trials see the

360
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,720
science

361
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,799
and not be embarrassed you know back

362
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
then the stigma back then is not how it

363
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,719
was then

364
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,240
today back then it was you had to

365
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,000
you know look over your shoulder who's

366
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,759
watching you you know god forbid you're

367
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,600
on a train or a plane or whatever and

368
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,480
someone sees that you're looking at you

369
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,120
know a marijuana website you know and so

370
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,120
we wanted to build a site that

371
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,200
doctors and patients and families and

372
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,600
governments and pharmacists could trust

373
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,879
the information and not feel

374
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,480
like someone's looking over shoulder

375
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,639
like oh i caught you i caught you and

376
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,278
so by that point we had already met a

377
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,879
lot of people um and actually a couple

378
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,639
of them were on the panel that's why i

379
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,159
was really excited when you guys asked

380
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,000
me if i would uh

381
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,039
partake in this

382
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,039
and

383
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,360
so we started incorporating fecal oil

384
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,919
full extract cannabis oil and a lot of

385
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,039
people call it rick simpson oil and and

386
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,879
i don't want to take anything away from

387
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,159
rick simpson oil but rick simpson's

388
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,919
protocol

389
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,278
canadian

390
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,039
skin cancer

391
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,559
high thc

392
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,399
and

393
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,078
it's not a one size fits all and we'll

394
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,120
get into this you know his is take a

395
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,638
gram you know and and more is better and

396
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,320
that's not always the case

397
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,440
and all cancers are treated differently

398
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,760
and this is again part of what this

399
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,760
panel is about clinical focus that it's

400
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,919
not a one-size-fits-all you know age

401
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,240
weight current health condition

402
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,120
the sensitivities the the stage of the

403
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,360
ailment and and god forbid it be cancer

404
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,600
but also um you know drug to drug

405
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,120
interactions and so what works for me

406
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,399
you know you you and i both young males

407
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,519
uh you're probably a lot younger than me

408
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
but uh um you know but but

409
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,039
you know our formulation our guidance

410
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,120
our dosing you know may be different you

411
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,278
know um from sensitivities and how our

412
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,879
bodies made up and so by that point we

413
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,198
at the six month mark we incorporated

414
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,039
the fake oil still minute amount under

415
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,359
his tongue at night before bed it was a

416
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,240
four part t8c

417
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,600
to one part cbd ratio of the soil and we

418
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,639
would do it at night just because

419
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
he could sleep through any of the

420
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,759
psychoactive if there was any and a

421
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,198
couple times there there was and so

422
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,559
um

423
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,120
and at nine months i'm fast forward in

424
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,719
the story and at nine months um the

425
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,078
phone rang it was 10 o'clock at night

426
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,600
and i are in bed watching tv and the

427
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,519
phone rang and we're like oh my gosh

428
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,879
here's that dreaded call and it was my

429
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,240
mother-in-law we picked it up i said is

430
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,278
everything okay she said check your

431
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,360
email

432
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,439
jumped out of bed checked the email and

433
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,680
there's an email that they sent from

434
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,360
their oncologist that said no evidence

435
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,359
of recurrent disease

436
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,399
and talk about the tears of joy this

437
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,159
time and it was like oh my goodness

438
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,159
you know there is

439
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,159
science behind this there is it does

440
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,600
work and i never want to give anybody

441
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,399
false hope because i've seen this plant

442
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,079
work

443
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,000
and i've seen it not work

444
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,638
working to me is saving a life saving a

445
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,120
body working for someone else could be i

446
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,879

452
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,079
and so karen and i'm

453
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,759
not only having this success story and

454
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,719
being able to share it to the to the

455
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,720
world

456
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
you know um

457
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,839
people always say you know you guys are

458
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:29,278
good ambassadors again bringing the

459
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,199
stigma back in 2010 11 12 13 to where it

460
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,399
is now people ought to automatically

461
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,879
though you just want to get high you

462
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,879
just want to get high and so we went on

463
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,360
this journey of education and

464
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,879
information education information and

465
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,399
not only educating the patients and

466
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,519
families but the most important

467
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,320
educating the doctors you know patients

468
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,399
now

469
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,160
you know cannabis is not going away good

470
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,919
or bad it's not for everyone i'm the

471
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,919
first to say that's not for everyone i

472
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,719
never say cure and i never say it's the

473
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,879
golden uh willy wonka ticket you know

474
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,600
you take this and you're you're healed

475
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,720
um you know there goes and i'm a fan of

476
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,038
of a whole arsenal of getting your body

477
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,240
back to balance if it's exercise if it's

478
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,480
diet if it's cannabis if it's

479
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,120
prayer meditation whatever you know i'm

480
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,959
a big fan of all that

481
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,719
and i'm a fan of conventional medicine

482
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,120
as well in incorporating that as well as

483
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,360
integrative uh as well as functional and

484
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,239
then cannabis and other other herbs as

485
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,279
well

486
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,439
and so

487
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,879
we started on this journey of the

488
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,038
importance of educating doctors and as

489
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,039
california was leading the way back then

490
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,558
it's been legal since 1996 at the

491
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,558
medical level

492
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,240
other states started to follow but the

493
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,160
one thing that was lacking

494
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,960
was no one knew what to do

495
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,279
yeah you know and so it would say oh

496
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,279
great ben i'm a cannabis doctor and

497
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,359
here's your recommendation and call me

498
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,038

499
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,479
what do i do now i'll just go down to

500
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,839
the dispensary

501
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,400
that's great when we're you and i were

502
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,000
20. we probably you know had those type

503
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,600
of data like won't be doing that one

504
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,839
again you know like

505
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,399
you know but when you're

506
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,918
sick or you're scared parent with a

507
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,240
pediatric child

508
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,759
or you're a scared

509
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,839
child with a geriatric mom and dad

510
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,160
you know or even yourself you want to

511
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,918
make sure that you know they're getting

512
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,759
the right guidance and so it's

513
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,720
frustrating and i've seen a lot in this

514
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,480
industry over the past 11 12 years

515
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,160
of what patients think more is better oh

516
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,440
i have sleep issues let me take that and

517
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,840
i'll go into the dispensary and i have

518
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,279
anxiety yes i'll take that and i have an

519
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,439
eating issue somebody i'll take that and

520
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,918
they walk out with 16 17 products no

521
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,679
exaggeration you know i've worked with

522
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,120
so many seniors at retirement

523
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,880
communities and they show me their bag

524
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,798
of goodies that they grabbed

525
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,919
and it's like oh and so that's the part

526
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,720
you know as

527
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,240
cannabis is becoming more of an approved

528
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,839
and i will say medicine a lot of people

529
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,679
don't want to say medicine but an

530
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,480
approved option

531
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,038
um

532
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,599
medicine you know i think

533
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,960
it also as it's growing in the majority

534
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,839
of states now

535
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,679
uh not only here in the us but globally

536
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,159
doctors need to be educated

537
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,480
because it's again it's not a one size

538
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,038
fits all and i share this with with

539
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,200
patients and doctors alike that it's not

540
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,160
illegal to ask the question even if

541
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,519
you're in an illegal state um you know

542
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,120
some doctors are like i don't want to

543
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,440
touch it and so and same thing with

544
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,719
patients and patients i've had them say

545
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
you know ben

546
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
i'm gonna act like you didn't ask me

547
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,200
that question

548
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
and if i find out ben that you use

549
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,558
cannabis

550
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,559
uh i'm gonna ask you to get another

551
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:38,319
another doctor and this is generally

552
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:40,720
this happens uh more so in the um the

553
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,639
the senior world the geriatric world uh

554
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,720
happened to my aunt you know i've like

555
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,480
as i mentioned i've spoken at retirement

556
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,000
communities and i always ask

557
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,360
the question how many people have tried

558
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,519
cannabis and have this discussion with

559
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,240
their doctor and you you would see the

560
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,079
hands go up and one one lady

561
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,038
she was in the mid 80s and she said my

562
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,960
doctor

563
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,960
shared if he if i did use it that he

564
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,480
would ask me to find another doctor and

565
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,480
we sat there what'd you do she goes i

566
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,400
fired him and boy the laughter and the

567
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,240
round of applause i said you know but i

568
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,798
applaud her for doing that this is her

569
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,319
body this is your body you know and you

570
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,119
should have options and that's the

571
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,579
unfortunate thing about cannabis

572
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,959
being

573
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:19,678
[Music]

574
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,919
legal in some states and not others

575
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,600
god forbid something happens to you and

576
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,840
you live in an illegal state one you're

577
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,038
getting the black market not safe to not

578
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:31,599
safe and tested and regulated

579
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,759
or two you're forced to now

580
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,079
be a cannabis refugee which a lot of

581
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,400
families did a few years ago now you

582
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,359
know you're they're able to stay put but

583
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,280
when you are a cannabis refugee

584
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,079
not only leaving your support group your

585
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:48,960
family your doctors your schooling your

586
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,038
church your friends everything and going

587
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
here and having to start again you know

588
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,720
but a lot of parents

589
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,400
do that would do that for their loved

590
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,240
one you know their child or their loved

591
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,280
one and so you know so that's the thing

592
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,558
we we pride our we pride ourselves on is

593
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,759
um

594
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,319
someone coined the term we were at a

595
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,079
conference i think in 2011

596
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,759
in san jose california in there we had

597
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,240
our booth there and someone said you

598
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,558
guys are like well webmd huh i said

599
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,798
that's a great way to put it in in an

600
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,678
elevator you know two second pitch what

601
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,798
do you do webmd of the cannabis industry

602
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,600
and you know um

603
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,679
not trying to say comparison but

604
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,199
it's you know a site that people can

605
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,798
come to

606
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,640
get information

607
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,240
meet with a doctor we have doctors and

608
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,679
nurses that consult with patients and

609
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,079
their families and their doctors on

610
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,480
there via phone and video

611
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,079
we don't write recommendations and so a

612
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,519
lot of doc a lot of patients will go to

613
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,038
a doctor as i mentioned earlier in the

614
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,279
in our talk

615
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,679
like okay ben here's your recommendation

616
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,519
call me in a year if you want to renew

617
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,600
okay now what do i do and so a lot of

618
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,440
the because the doctors don't know

619
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,399
they're able to do a consult with with

620
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,960
our

621
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,559
staff and i am always invite the doctors

622
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,240
in so everyone's on the same page as

623
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:06,480
well and so um you know so that's why

624
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,038
education and information is so

625
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,400
important and again as as this is

626
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:11,679
growing and all these products are

627
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,200
coming out

628
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,038
you know it's confusing to me sometimes

629
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,319
when i see all these products and all

630
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:17,359
these claims

631
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,599
you know and that's the thing that's

632
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,038
frustrating is that

633
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,399
i think until

634
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,240
i don't say getting the government

635
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,919
involved but until you know people

636
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,159
really look at this as an option you

637
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,080
know it's sad because

638
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:35,039
i just lost a dear friend she was in her

639
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:37,279
mid late 60s to breast cancer but she

640
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,400
successfully fought breast cancer for 19

641
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,678
years on non-fda approved

642
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,080
modalities

643
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,840
you know from ozone to

644
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:50,158
vitamin b17 uh salicinium i mean the

645
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,158
list goes on but it saved her life for

646
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,760
19 years she's

647
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,280
you know battled this and it's

648
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,279
frustrating that you know

649
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,919
americans you know we don't have access

650
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,599
to that a lot of a lot of patients will

651
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,120
go overseas where they have access you

652
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,038
know go down to mexico where they have

653
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,798
access and there's some great doctors

654
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,640
you know and i think it's wonderful that

655
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,720
these doctors actually take a stand and

656
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,320
i feel the same thing with cannabis at

657
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,679
least have an option it's not doesn't

658
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,599
work for everybody

659
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,120
you know it doesn't chemo radiation

660
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,839
doesn't always work for everybody you

661
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,399
know but but at least it's an option and

662
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,798
so and again you can incorporate those

663
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,600
with um conventional medicine if you

664
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:32,079
want to go that route please do so

665
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,639
you can use cannabis it's not going to

666
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,319
zero each other out you can use cannabis

667
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,759
with chemo radiation we work with a lot

668
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,720
of cancer patients after i was saying

669
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:43,038
that and cancer has affected uh me and

670
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,960
i'll go into that in a second um

671
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,119
you know but if you are gonna do chemo

672
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,519

appetite sleep

674
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,158
mood as well as healing and so

675
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,879
you know i would never tell anybody not

676
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,640
to do this and do this

677
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,760
and i say that how it's affected me in

678
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,159
2017 my wife corrine was diagnosed with

679
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,599
pancreatic cancer and she was somebody i

680
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,919
mean that's the part of life i don't

681
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,278
understand is

682
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,640
you know you do

683
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,240
you do good

684
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,600
you do everything you're supposed to

685
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,599
from

686
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,158
treating others with respect

687
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,000
helping others which we have done for

688
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,440
you know 10 12 years here with the

689
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,038
united patients group

690
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,360
but also

691
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,879
she ate well didn't drink worked out

692
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,038
stayed healthy

693
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
and cancer and ailment does not

694
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,200
discriminate and that's the thing that

695
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,480
that's the part of of life that i don't

696
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,640
understand and you know why not offer

697
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,159
cannabis as an option as we've seen it

698
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,840

some top products and um you know and

737
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,798
that's the part that's where i think

738
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,919
this industry is going thank goodness

739
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,480
but also

740
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,080
um we're it still has a long way to go

741
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,919
with and that's the part where the

742
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,000
government's getting involved

743
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,278
where they're adding regulations and so

744
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,159
nowaday

745
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,159
you know

746
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,360
the majority i should say i'm looking

747
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,039
around see if i had a product here but

748
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:24,158
the majority of products nowadays have a

749
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,480
qr code that show a test result sure you

750
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,400
know test results not only just to say

751
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,720
oh yeah it has thc or cbd or the

752
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,080
cannabinoid profiles but has it been

753
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,558
tested for mold pesticides metals is it

754
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,000
safe is it organic is it usda certified

755
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,558
is it grown here in the united states

756
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,119
where was it grown and so these are all

757
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,639
things that i always share with patients

758
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,599
as a patient advocate and health

759
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,600

they have two weeks like we'd had and

762
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,759

763
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,360

776
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,480
other way around so hey i've done all

777
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,360
the talking sorry

778
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,960
no

779
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,719
no and it's a great story and thank you

780
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,558
so much for sharing it really does like

781
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,240
i said set the stage for

782
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,278
um all the work that you've done since

783
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,359
it started

784
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,599
uh your experience started back in in

785
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:37,119
2010 up until now and i wanted to ask

786
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,359
you about that because you had mentioned

787
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,599
that back in 2010 you went down to the

788
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,199
dispensary and there wasn't nearly the

789
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,558
amount of products and the amount of

790
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,000
information that there is now and so i

791
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,278
have to imagine that there was some

792
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,200
level of luck involved with that the

793
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,798
product that you got

794
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,000
actually worked

795
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:59,839
and

796
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,440
i wonder if in some ways patients today

797
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,519
almost have a more difficult time

798
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,679
because there are so many more choices

799
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:09,599
and there is so much more information

800
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,600
it's almost like analysis paralysis

801
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,839
i know this is not video but i'm smiling

802
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,519
as you're sharing that because i still

803
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,639
remember walking into that dispensary

804
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,398
and it would just

805
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,440
label cannabis cannabis cannabis

806
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,879
cannabis cannabis and and i remember

807
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,120
after

808
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,559
six months seven months and then after

809
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,558
getting you know having my

810
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,038
father-in-law's

811
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,038
hospice team fire him because now he's

812
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,960
walking and driving do everything

813
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,000
you know and we were starting we

814
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,079
we got

815
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,480
involved with this industry and met some

816
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,240
scientists and doctors and

817
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,679
labs there's some you know i won't

818
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
mention names but there's a lab here in

819
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,278
california

820
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,480
and i went to them and i said oh can you

821
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,558
test this

822
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,360
and i kid you not ben

823
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:56,000
it was exactly the 100 opposite of what

824
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:58,639
they had it labeled in the dispensary

825
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,759
and that's that's really put me up going

826
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,840
okay

827
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,879
now we have an issue here

828
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,240
but

829
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,880
thank goodness i don't know if we had

830
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,640
some higher power that was you know i

831
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,080

832
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,278
always lived our life is everything

833
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,439
happens here for a reason and everything

834
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:17,038
happens for a reason

835
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,720
i guess good and bad because i'm still

836
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,158
trying to figure out this thing with

837
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,798
corinne and even setting up for this

838
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,399
call you know i was just you know i have

839

pictures of her around here but i just

840
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,798
thought

841
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
how houses even possible you know but

842
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,639
but

843
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,038
seeing the different you know with

844
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,278
labeling and regulations and i kid you

845
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,480
not it was the blind leading the blind

846
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,640
then and it was trial and error and i

847
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,038
kid you not been knock on wood if we had

848
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,480
no air and that's why coming out of this

849
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,599
coming out of the gate and hitting a

850
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,440
grand slam right right off first pitch

851
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,599

854
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,038

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,039
cannabinoids play a role you know thc is

872
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,640
what everyone has known for years but

873
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,200
also has a stigma from the reefer

874
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,600
madness here so just it's high it gets

875
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,880
everyone you know stone stupid etc you

876

get nothing done

877
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,679
now there are so many benefits to thc

878
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,360
without thc i know my father-in-law

879
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,880
would not be here the studies show that

880
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,319
thc yes it gives you you know your fork

881
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,840
what's wrong with being your fork but it

882
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,278
gives you a high

883
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,119
but it helps with things

884
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:02,319
with

885
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,079
mood

886
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:08,000
helps with appetite helps with pain

887
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,639
but it also helps with cancer then you

888
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,398
have cbd you know with with all its

889
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,360
other benefits from pain and sleep um

890
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,678
inflammation a cancer fighter you know

891
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,599
so i every time i present i always put

892
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,519
this roll of duct tape up on this on my

893
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,519
screen and people look at me like hey

894
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,278
man you got the wrong screen but i said

895
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,880
i don't want to say cannabis is like

896
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,558
duct tape with a million and one uses

897
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,039
but when you really get down to it all

898
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,359
the cannabinoids play a part

899
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,798
and if you're able to intertwine these

900
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,240
called the entourage effect you know

901
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,240
they really work well and karen would

902
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,759
always describe it as like baking a cake

903
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,000
and leaving the eggs or

904
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,319
or flour out you know

905
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,839
that's why you know they they go they go

906
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,879
together and you asked me one other

907
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,398
question and

908
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,960
um

909
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,239
i was gonna go down that road i'm sorry

910
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,480
do you remember

911
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,399
uh well we were just talking about how

912
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,319
there being so many choices and so many

913
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,278
different products out there now is it

914
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,038
almost harder to find the right

915
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,519
there's the right solution for you than

916
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:08,798
it was back then it was it's fun that's

917
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,599
that's that's what i was going to get on

918
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,240
so

919
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,519
when we we did this with uh karen's

920
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,278
father

921
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,798
we used a four parts thc one part cbd

922
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:19,919
and people were like it's impossible you

923
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,720
have to again that's what's you know and

924
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,799
everyone was with came on you know cbd

925
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,319
started hitting the road uh and everyone

926
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,639
talked about it and so

927
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,398
uh people are like thc it's supposed to

928
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,919
be cbd i said this is where the media

929
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,079
has confused a lot of people you know

930
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,240
this wonder drug cbd that just just

931
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,759
appeared not the case you know cannabis

932
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,319
in this plan has been around for

933
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:43,119
thousands of years thousands of years

934
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,720
but the one thing that we used to go

935
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,518
before all these other cannabinoids were

936
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,200
introduced and point zero five this and

937
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,960
take five milligrams that and one you

938
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,038
know one milligram of this

939
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,640
we saw more success with patients just

940
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,919
doing a regular four to one ratio that

941
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,919
was us four parts thc one part cbd

942
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,399
and it was amazing what we saw and then

943
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,320
when other things were incorporated of

944
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,558
the different you know cannabinoids and

945
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,798
terpenes and

946
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,798
you saw this this graph and no

947
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,639
disrespect to any doctors out there we

948
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,440
were you know but we would see this

949
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,320
graph of higher success really

950
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,240
with

951
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,000
i guess from certain elements

952
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,240
um you know everyone's different you

953
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,839

you and i ben can go out and go wine

997
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,599
tasting take a sip of wine we're

998
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:58,319
perfectly fine if we drank three bottles

999
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,680
of wine we're gonna be intoxicated

1000
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,240
probably throwing up

1001
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,838
same thing with cannabis in in any level

1002
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,919
you know they always hear

1003
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,799
them say you know go low go slow but

1004
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,358
same thing with thc you can have success

1005
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,119
with one two three milligrams you don't

1006
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,838
need 100 milligrams

1007
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,760
you know and so why not go go with this

1008
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:19,920
it's funny we started with with

1009
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,680
corinne's father just low amounts and

1010
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,639
people said you need the high amounts

1011
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,559
you need to get up to a gram a day

1012
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,838
and we saw success and we were at a

1013
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:32,960
conference up in portland oregon

1014
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:34,639
and we sat down in the lounge just to

1015
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,480
get we were exhibiting as well and we

1016
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,480
just sat there taking a little break and

1017
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,760
we could hear a doctor speaking on the

1018
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,719
loudspeaker

1019
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,839
about

1020
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:44,399
cannabis

1021
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,960
and the benefits of low and slow as well

1022
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,800
as micro dosing and we went i'll be darn

1023
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,000
this is what we've been doing for a year

1024
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,320
and everyone's been saying no you've got

1025
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,400
to take grammy gram gram a day

1026
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,920
so i ran upstairs to see who it was and

1027
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,000
we opened the door it was a packed room

1028
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,200
standing room only and you know who's on

1029
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,960
stage

1030
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:04,960
dustin's sulak and i said i'll be darned

1031
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,800
so everyone surrounded him afterwards

1032
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,838
and so you know a few days later karen

1033
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,359
and i

1034
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,679
called him and we had a skype call and

1035
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:14,559
he was back in portland not portland

1036
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,319
part in oregon but in maine

1037
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:18,639
and we shared our story with him and he

1038
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,079
says yes these are the things and it's

1039
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,039
like

1040
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,200
finally

1041
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,358
someone because people used to say

1042
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:26,799
impossible you guys are just telling us

1043
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:28,000
i was like we're not even selling your

1044
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,920
product

1045
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,320
you know and then when dustin came out

1046
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,079
and other doctors started speaking about

1047
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,680
the micro dosing

1048
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,800
you know people said i'll be darn how

1049
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,559
did you guys know that i said it was

1050
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,519
just common sense to me

1051
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:44,159
you know he was totally out and weak and

1052
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,920
shriveling up and why blast him you know

1053
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:47,679
it'd be like you and i going out for you

1054
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,039
know i run and ride every day i'm not a

1055
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,719
marathon runner

1056
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,559
you know but if i went and ran a

1057
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,759
marathon today boy my hips and my knees

1058
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,400
would be hurting you know i can get up

1059
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,119
to that but slowly build up let's do

1060
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,760
let's do a block let's do you know five

1061
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,358
five kilometers you know 5k you know and

1062
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,320
so the same thing i think with cannabis

1063
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,799
our bodies are our fine-tuned machine

1064
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,599
and you know this is the part that that

1065
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,519
why

1066
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,480
education and information is so

1067
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,960
important and why as the the laws are

1068
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,480
starting to expand to

1069
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,920
pretty much all the states here in the

1070
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,358
u.s

1071
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,400
there's still a lack of doctors knowing

1072
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:23,838
that knowledge

1073
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,320
yeah you know there's still a lack of

1074
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:28,320
knowledge and so we have yes we have you

1075
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,720
know legal access to

1076
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,960
all these americans but the doctors

1077
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,480
still don't know and i still

1078
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,559
say there's about i'm going to say i

1079
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,639
used to say eight to ten maybe there's

1080
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:41,519
12 to 15 percent of doctors that truly

1081
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,719
know about dosing nowadays and i and

1082
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,519
that's that's

1083
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,879
that is part of you know my excitement

1084
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,639
when you guys ask me

1085
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,480

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,200
didn't just pop up

1092
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,279
you know because they said oh

1093
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,039
i'm going to be in the cannabis industry

1094
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,160
now they they've been you know the

1095
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,719
pioneers uh in this industry for eight

1096
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:13,519
10 12 years as well and so it's good

1097
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:15,439
it's good to see that and that you um

1098
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:19,039
congrats for coming out here to the west

1099
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,358
coast uh this year um you know but but

1100
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,519
to have some great speakers in any

1101
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,559
conferences is important and to be part

1102
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,440
of this panel with those um medical

1103
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,559
professionals is pretty exciting

1104
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,159
yeah i knew you were going to say the

1105
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,159
name dustin sulak when you were

1106
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,838
describing that because he actually has

1107
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,639
been on the podcast before he talked

1108
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:41,279
about dosing yeah and he you know shared

1109
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,838
the information that that he's

1110
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,599
gathered over the years about how

1111
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,159
he calls it a biphasic effect with

1112
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,480
cannabis that that low

1113
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,639
dose can sometimes be even more

1114
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,800
effective than the higher doses

1115
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:58,639
um and how it kind of follows this wave

1116
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,720
pattern which was really fascinating and

1117
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,118
you make a great point about how

1118
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,399
there's not enough medical professionals

1119
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,800
who are knowledgeable about the

1120
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,320
endocannabinoid system or cannabinoid

1121
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,519
therapies and that's one of the main

1122
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,680
reasons that

1123
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,440
we've added to canmed the full-day

1124
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,358
medical practicum

1125
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,838
which is a pre-conference event

1126
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,400
that's led by bonnie goldstein dustin

1127
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,400
sulak louise thiessen and kevin spellman

1128
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,880
so great so the healthcare professionals

1129
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,639
can come and get the latest information

1130
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,640
and all that clinical experience that

1131
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:32,639
those medical professionals have amassed

1132
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:34,239
over the years so we can kind of help to

1133
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,078
at least increase that percentage so

1134
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,479
there's more medical professionals out

1135
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,359
there who can give great advice

1136
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,599
well you you nail you nailed

1137
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,358
nailed them on on who you have leading

1138
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,519
that and uh

1139
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,559
you know i've known uh

1140
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,838
dustin eloise and bonnie for years uh

1141
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,358
but they've

1142
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:54,960
not taken anything we don't do

1143
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,039
conferences anymore since crin pass but

1144
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,280
we used to do conferences and offered

1145
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,960
cme accreditation and we'd have about 85

1146
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,160
90 of our attendees we're actually

1147
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,519
medical professionals not in the

1148
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,639
cannabis industry

1149
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:09,358
and dustin and eloise and bonnie um

1150
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:12,078
we're always regulars dustin and bonnie

1151
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,318

1152
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,440
um you know like i said they're they're

1153

been to our home uh eloise and bonnie

1155

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,440
option more on the patient side patient

1197
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:44,239
side excuse me so

1198

ask questions do you know do your

1200
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,559
research to see if this is for you it's

1201
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,159
not for everyone i'm the first to say

1202
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:51,920
this is not for everyone and i do not

1203
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,000
want everyone to think anyone to think

1204
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,559
this is a cure all as i mentioned i

1205
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,960
never used the word cure but um there

1206
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,119
are a lot of different choices out there

1207
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,880
and just because you say oh a friend of

1208
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,119
mine is a friend of a friend of a friend

1209

grew it or she grew it i mean i've known

1211
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,480
growers that have been doing this you

1212
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,880
know probably longer than you and i have

1213
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,800
been alive and every once in a while

1214
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,838
they have to cut down their whole crop

1215
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,119
because mold or bugs or something got it

1216
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:20,239
was in there so

1217
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,000
you know

1218
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,318
i'm a fan i'm a fan of a friend of a

1219
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,239
friend type of stuff but especially when

1220
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,079
you're you're immune compromised and if

1221
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,919
god forbid you're battling something as

1222
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,760
severe as cancer make sure all your

1223
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,880
products are tested and nowadays you

1224
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,960
know in

1225
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,960
all the states that are legal

1226
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,920
they do have testing labs and all the

1227
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,240
products should have the not only

1228
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,480
website on there or contact information

1229
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,838
but also qr code and if they don't have

1230
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,679
it this is what i share with with

1231
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,719
patients all the time go to another

1232
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,239
company you know either call the company

1233
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,318
you don't you know it's not up to you

1234
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,598
make sure it has test ratings or it's

1235
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:57,599
not up to you the patient or the

1236
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,280
consumer to go out and test a product

1237
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,760
you can and you do know some patients

1238
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,680
that want to double check but make sure

1239
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,079
you find a product company that has all

1240
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,159
the information i'm a big fan of testing

1241
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,640
the soil first because what's in that

1242
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:13,440
soil is very important so make sure

1243
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:17,118
there's no you know they they go from uh

1244
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,559
i always say from soil seed to sale and

1245
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,640
check the soil make sure it doesn't it's

1246
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,480
not toxic doesn't have any you know

1247
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,440
overflow stuff like that nowadays with

1248
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,838
hemp you know hemp is known as mop weed

1249
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,760
like mopping up a spill and so a lot of

1250
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,199
times they would you know in in certain

1251
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,040
areas where they'd have a toxic spill

1252
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,439
they'd grow hemp and it would

1253
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,358
suck suck up the toxins and then they'd

1254
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,559
test the soil again and go oh cool we'll

1255
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:40,480
build a community here we'll build

1256
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:44,159
church homes schools

1257
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,159
etc and so make sure if you are if you

1258
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,559
live in a state that doesn't

1259
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:51,440
give you the option for

1260
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,920
thc products and cbd is your only option

1261
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,920
i think wonderful go for that but

1262
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,920
getting it at a grocery store not i'm

1263
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,599

1264
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,280
station i'm not a big fan of there's a

1265
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,599
lot of companies that that are online

1266
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,680
look for usda certified look for grown

1267
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,200
in america and make sure it's tested

1268
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:08,879
make sure it's tested and they test

1269
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,629
again to make sure it doesn't have any

1270
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,000
mold pesticides

1271
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,920
[Music]

1272
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,679
toxins and make sure the cannabinoid

1273
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,039
profile is in there for patients that

1274
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,440
work for

1275
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:24,400
jobs where there's zero zero tolerance

1276
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,559
meaning no no thc they do have broad

1277
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,920
spectrum which is pure straight

1278
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:32,000
cbd which is also beneficial and so you

1279
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,000
can make sure that you ask that company

1280
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000

00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,719
not only having your personal physician

1320
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,640
on there to talk and he or she can also

1321

education with as well as information as

1324
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,358
education is huge and i always use this

1325
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,280
analogy of throwing a pebble in the pond

1326
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:17,199

1327
