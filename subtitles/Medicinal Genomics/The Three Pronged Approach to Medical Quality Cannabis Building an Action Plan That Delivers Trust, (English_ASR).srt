1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,640
um well thanks to the maybe 15 of you

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,080
that are in here

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,320
um

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,240
i'm i'm jordan zager i'm uh

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
with dewey scientific um today i'm going

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,599
to talk to you guys about

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,160
uh how we can deliver

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,759
medical quality botanical cannabis um

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,719
and and sort of the steps we need to

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,800
take um as as cultivators and

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,239
those involved in manufacturing to

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,880
actually make that work

13
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,278
um so i think to understand this topic

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,159
it's important to look at how the fda

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,880
looks at cannabis as medicine

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,718
this is a slide straight off the fda's

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,280
website where they say there's two

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,879
routes for cannabis as medicine

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,520
in the eyes of the fda there's cannabis

20
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,280
derived compounds like epidiolex

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,960
this is largely

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,520
extracts from homogenized plant tissue

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,600
or there are cannabis related compounds

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,760
like marinol and sesame these are

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
synthetically

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,280
compounds that stimulate the

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,478
endocannabinoid system but don't

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,159
necessarily come from the plant itself

29
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,400
but right there's a big problem here in

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,840
that the fda is ignoring botanical

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,159
cannabis as treatment and this is

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,840
important because if you look at the

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,479
history of medical cannabis dating back

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,799
to 1996 here in california the

35
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,438
overwhelming majority of medical

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,439
cannabis has been botanically derived if

37
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,879
not the flower itself

38
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:29,839
right 69 of medical cannabis consumers

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,759
consume smoked flour or they vaporize

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,600
flour

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,840
not to mention right vape pens are

42
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,879
definitely not to the medical quality or

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
purification levels of epidialex

44
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,158
so

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,640
right the fda is ignoring botanical

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,240
cannabis as a treatment uh why is that

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,239
and i think to answer that question uh

48
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,478
we need to look just at the history of

49
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,399
plant drive medicine uh going back to

50
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,560
the first instance of its use in

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
mesopotamia dating back

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,000
close to 5000 years

53
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:02,319
um skip ahead you know 2 000 years and

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,799
we're starting to see widespread use of

55
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,798
natural product medicine across

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,039
civilizations

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,959
jump up into the 19th century and we

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,559
have sort of the first isolation of a

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,560
plant-derived natural product being used

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,719
as a medicine in the form of morphine

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
um however crude plant extracts were

62
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,400
very widespread around the globe by by

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,840
this point

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
um

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,878
jumping into sort of the modern area

66
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,719
era uh single molecules

67
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,079
uh natural product medicines are being

68
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,039
developed you know think of penicillin

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,879
here

70
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,400
jump to the 80s

71
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,679
we start to see a decrease in natural

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,840
product medicines about 50 of all new uh

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,599
drugs are derived from natural products

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,640
however right leaving 50 percent that

75
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:43,840
are not

76
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,238
and this is sort of when chemical

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,239
synthesis really takes over um and this

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,680
has really been the route of pharma over

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,239
the last 30 years

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,360
fast forward to about 2007 and over the

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,599
previous 10 years only six plant derived

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
medicines were approved by the fda

83
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,560
right so pharma has increasingly moved

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,319
away from plant-derived medicines and

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,318
right considering cannabis is a plant

86
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,958
and we are here to talk about cannabis

87
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,799
medicine this is sort of um

88
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,319
non-congruent with with how i think most

89
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,480
of us view

90
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,799
natural products

91
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,158
in general um this is also evidenced by

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,680
the fact that all of these pharma

93
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,280
companies here on the left have

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,599
abandoned their natural product research

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,080
programs uh while only a handful have

96
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,079
actually held on to this so

97
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
um why are we seeing this shift away

98
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,680
from natural product medicines i mean

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
there's really three confounding factors

100
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
here

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,080
well first off these these lead

102
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,839
compounds the medicinally active

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,840
components are producing incredibly

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,439
small quantities in the plant

105
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
um

106
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,639
in general it's really hard to source

107
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,719
and harvest

108
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,000
these natural products you get poor

109
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,280
yields

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,639
oftentimes leading to impractical

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
scaling

112
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,399
and then not to mention a lot of these

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,318
compounds have high cytotoxicity so it

114
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,360
sort of renders synthetic biology

115
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,359
applications moot if it's just killing

116
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,599
the cells that are producing them

117
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,680
and then right if we're relying on

118
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,438
plant

119
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
a plant to produce this you know most

120
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,598
farmers are going to follow good

121
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,199
agricultural products they're going to

122
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,359
be using pesticides

123
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,959
there will be use of heavy metals to

124
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,319
some degree and this ultimately

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,319
contaminates the natural products

126
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,719
and a very good example this is taxol so

127
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
this is an anti-cancer

128
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
medicine one of the most widely

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
prescribed around the world

130
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,279
and it comes from

131
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,199
the

132
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,719
yew tree a

133
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,000
a large

134
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
family of trees

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,399
but

136
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
this taxol is produced primarily in the

137
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,039
needles but it comes in incredibly small

138
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,000
quantities with 0.004

139
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,319
yields and that doesn't even produce

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,959
the medicinal component of taxol it

141
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,478
produces uh sort of an intermediary

142
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,319
backbone that needs to be further

143
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,918
decorated through chemical synthesis um

144
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,040
not not to mention right going back to

145
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,478
those three problems with natural

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,120
product medicines uh these compounds are

147
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,279
very difficult to isolate and purify the

148
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,280
compound of interest so what you have

149
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,879
here are this uh on our y x axis we have

150
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,959
a number of different

151
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,360
uh u tree species

152
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,799
um and then the taxans that they produce

153
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
so depending on the species you're

154
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
looking at anywhere from you know four

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,759
to eleven

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,800
uh highly similar compounds that getting

157
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,560
a pure product is is very difficult

158
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,720
and then

159
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,199
to make things even in even tougher it

160
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,400
has a very elusive biosynthetic pathway

161
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,319
so anywhere you see a a reaction

162
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,758
that has a

163
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,240
a red

164
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,400
red lettering means that

165
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,160
we don't know the enzyme that catalyzes

166
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,239
this so this this poses another problem

167
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
for synthetic biology if we don't know

168
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,160
the gene responsible for the chemical

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,478
conversion we can't engineer a microbe

170
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,240
to produce it

171
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,680
but cannabis doesn't face these

172
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,240
limitations that most plant natural

173
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,519
products possess right in cannabis the

174
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,800
natural products are produced in

175
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,079
abundance right i put 15 yields here but

176
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,560
we all know that there are cannabis

177
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,079
varieties producing upwards of 30

178
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,038
of a single molecule

179
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,959
um

180
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,478
in most cannabis products these are

181
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,918
these are compounds that are very easy

182
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,959
to isolate you can go get pure

183
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,959
cannabinoids online

184
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,758
with with no problem and the

185
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,680
biosynthetic pathway has been very well

186
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
characterized we already have yeast

187
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,720
strains that are you know have been

188
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,560
engineered to produce cannabinoids

189
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,240
and just taking a look at the most

190
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
abundant natural products in in

191
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,199
botanical cannabis right we have the

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,680
cannabinoids things like cbd thc maybe

193
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,879
the more minor cannabinoids like the

194
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,800
varins

195
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,120
and then we have terpenes

196
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,000
it was you know last year a pretty good

197
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,000
study came out showing um that terpenes

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,360
are in fact uh interacting with the

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,038
cannabinoid system they've shown it you

200
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,160
know a mice model they also shown it in

201
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,240
in vitro assays

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,240
but right that we still have big sample

203
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,879
variation in botanical cannabis um so

204
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,639
what this data outlines here um is we

205
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,879
looked at the terpene and cannabinoid

206
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,598
content of nine commercial varieties

207
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,639
um we applied those right those values

208
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,560
of how much

209
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
uh natural products are

210
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,240
accumulating and and

211
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,840
we're able to visualize them so what's

212
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,680
important here is that cultivars um

213
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,359
generally group together but there's

214
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
still variation so if we're considering

215
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,800
a medicine

216
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,319
from botanical cannabis and something we

217
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,000
want to put into clinical trials you

218
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,439
have to be able to control this sample

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,038
variation

220
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,918
and this goes back right to the fda

221
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,839
statement

222
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,240
that they're ignoring botanical cannabis

223
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,318
as a treatment but can we change this by

224
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,319
reducing natural product variation in

225
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,800
the flower itself

226
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,960
my hypothesis is yes we can and we can

227
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,038
get there by following three pillars the

228
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,799
first is genetics right this is very

229
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,719
important because it drives what can

230
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,639
possibly be made right you're not going

231
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,639
to produce the varins if you don't have

232
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,079
the proper cannabinoid synthase involved

233
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,079
and the goal here is to understand

234
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,800
natural product quality and the overall

235
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,639
profile of any given cultivar

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,199
the second pillar is the environment

237
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,360
right the the environment is critical um

238
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,439
and in influencing the sort of the

239
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,598
magnitude of the the compounds produced

240
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,839
whether it's the terpenes or or the

241
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,598
cannabinoids or maybe another class of

242
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,399
molecules that are a little less well

243
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:27,918
studied

244
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,598
but the overall goal here would be to

245
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,079
reduce the variation of natural product

246
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,559
profiles from a single genetic source in

247
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,560
a defined environment and that final

248
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,639
pillar is post harvest right you have to

249
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,799
maintain the consistency

250
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,559
of the levels of bioactive compounds

251
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,838
during during storage of the product

252
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,479
right and here the goal would be to

253
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,480
reduce variation in the profile through

254
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,080
proper storage

255
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,600
so diving in that first pillar with

256
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,040
genetics

257
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,759
this is the driving force of natural

258
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,639
products so some research that has come

259
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,559
out is is largely that the chemotype or

260
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,480
the dominant cannabinoid

261
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,039
that the plant produces can sort of be

262
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,440
traced back to one of three

263
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,199
geographic origins whether it's

264
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,040
china or

265
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
western europe for

266
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,759
cbd producing cannabis largely what we

267
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,639
classify as hemp

268
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,838
and as well as right the thc containing

269
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,360
varieties having two origins

270
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,880
of domestication

271
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
largely in

272
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,399
central asia

273
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,039
and and what you see here with this

274
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,080
phylogenetic tree are the this is you

275
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,838
know a few hundred uh

276
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,920
cultivars of cannabis that were

277
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,800
genotyped and they write fall into

278
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:44,000
clusters that are sort of expectant from

279
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,919
three origins of domestication

280
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,720
uh but not only that right

281
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,639
we live in the the genomics era we can

282
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,480
identify you know what exactly is

283
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,838
contributing to the natural product

284
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
profile

285
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,680
at the genetic level so here this is

286
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,839
just a chromosome map of the cannabis

287
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,958
genome and where various genes involved

288
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,440
in cannabinoids and terpenes are located

289
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,759
just because a gene may be there doesn't

290
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,399
mean that it's turned on and working for

291
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,519
example right you might have a cba cbca

292
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,559
synthase but if it's not active

293
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
it's not going to produce anything

294
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,518
and here right we have another

295
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,200
phylogenetic tree and so what this is

296
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
these are all the characterized or

297
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,560
identified cannabinoid synthases

298
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,320
um everything from cbd synthase to some

299
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,399
of the enzymes involved in varin

300
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,720
production um

301
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,440
but what you see highlighted in blue

302
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,399
are

303
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,160
inactive enzymes right so going back to

304
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,639
genetics or driving this

305
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,120
if you have an inactive thc synthase

306
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,319
right you're not going to produce thc

307
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
um

308
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,079
and the same could be said with the

309
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,839
terpenes so far there's been about 33

310
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,120
uh genes and proteins that have been

311
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,760
functionally characterized meaning we

312
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,320
know exactly the the chemistry that they

313
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,559
perform and how they're related and and

314
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,240
just like the the cannabinoids if a gene

315
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,119
is not turned on you're not going to

316
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,120
have that product

317
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,759
and we have we have data pointing

318
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,160
that's very consistent with with this

319
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,399
hypothesis that right you need the gene

320
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,319
to be expressed so up top here the top

321
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,919
table this is

322
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,079
terpene accumulation across nine

323
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:21,039
varieties and the bottom table is the

324
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:24,159
gene expression of the terpene synthase

325
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,599
that produces some of these compounds

326
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,719
highlighted in green right this is alpha

327
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,759
pinene

328
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,079
and two of these varieties it

329
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,559
accumulates in incredibly small amounts

330
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,439
um and well sure enough alfie alpha

331
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,359
pineal synthase is not expressed by

332
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,920
those varieties

333
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,000
same could be said with osamine here

334
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,319
right so gene expression is driving

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,839
terpene abundance gene function is

336
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,600
driving

337
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,959
uh cannabinoid abundance

338
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,320
um right and

339
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,319
like i mentioned earlier these are

340
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,240
incredibly well known biosynthetic

341
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,879
pathways we know what regulates them for

342
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,440
the most part light regulates

343
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,600
the production of of these enzymes that

344
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
produce these compounds

345
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,879
they're also primarily produced in

346
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,399
structures called trichomes so they're

347
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,600
made in one central location

348
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,360
right so this leads us to the

349
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,959
environment right light influences the

350
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,159
production of these compounds uh so what

351
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,239
data out there can can we use to uh sort

352
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,319
of identify how to reduce

353
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,919
that natural product variation and its

354
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
three critical factors being light

355
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,719
temperature in something called vapor

356
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,680
pressure deficit

357
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,360
um so in the the context of light

358
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,039
the quality of light that the plant

359
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,278
receives this is right the specific

360
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,799
wavelengths that are feeding the plant

361
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,360
it's it's

362
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,199
light source uh drives

363
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,680
phytochemical or natural product

364
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,160
production in plants uh for example

365
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,958
terpenes are stimulated by wavelengths

366
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,919
of 600 nanometers um and then here on on

367
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,000
the right these are just the the typical

368
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,838
light spectra from common lighting

369
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,399
sources whether it's sunlight

370
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,440
uh high pressure sodium lamps or

371
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,480
led

372
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,040
fixtures

373
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,720
but right with what whichever method the

374
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,958
cultivator chooses

375
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,160
it is influencing how much or how little

376
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,479
of any given compound is produced

377
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,039
so this is some data from from

378
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,519
us at dewey

379
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,679
where we grew the exact same strain

380
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,278
fluoride explorer in two different

381
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,519
environments one

382
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,679
with sun as the primary light lighting

383
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,600
source as the only lighting source and

384
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,799
then high pressure sodium as the other

385
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,040
right so two very different light

386
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,000
spectrums this is impacting and

387
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,278
influencing the terpene profile where

388
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,799
you can

389
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,639
see the differences between the two

390
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,838
right certain compounds are not made in

391
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,320
uniform

392
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,240
amounts so this just goes back to

393
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
control the environment control the

394
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,879
exact natural product profile that's

395
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,720
being produced by the plant

396
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,039
um right so the another critical factor

397
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,000
here is is temperature so take this data

398
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:59,120
with a little grain of salt this is from

399
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,519
uh conifers pine trees um but what these

400
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,879
researchers shown was

401
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,240
at 30 degrees celsius for the most part

402
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,759
terpenes are down regulated so in any of

403
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,000
these chemical structures if there is a

404
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,159
red box there that means that it was

405
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,958
increased in production at 30 degrees

406
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,639
but

407
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,479
the overwhelming majority of these boxes

408
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,240
is blue meaning that it

409
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,440
these levels are decreased when grown at

410
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,519
30 degrees compared to 20 degrees

411
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,360
and then the final factor is vapor

412
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,879
pressure deficit this is more or less a

413
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,120
measurement of how water is moving

414
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,039
through the plant or or you know is

415
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,560
there a drought stress event impacting

416
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:39,039
the plant during growth

417
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,039
and sure enough in drought conditions

418
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,320
you see increases in terpene profile

419
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,519
with some terpenes some instances you

420
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,879
see decreases so you have to control the

421
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,320
amount of water the plant is getting as

422
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,399
well to reduce that natural product

423
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
variation

424
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,839
and this is some data pulled from our

425
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,519
greenhouses at dewey where we have an

426
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,720
example of unstable conditions with

427
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,198
those those three components

428
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,120
[Music]

429
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,759
compared to stable conditions so right

430
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,600
there is a method for monitoring data

431
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,559
and we've we've created a little scoring

432
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,278
system

433
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,759
to

434
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,439
we just call it our environmental growth

435
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,078
score um

436
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,160
where if you don't have proper vdp

437
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,359
the the flow of water through the plant

438
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,278
you don't even

439
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,199
add we can't even take into account

440
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,519
temperature but once you you

441
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,359
nail vpd you can then start to score

442
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,679
temperature and eventually when you get

443
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,320
there you can start to score uh lighting

444
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,239
interval or or humidity of the grow room

445
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,639
um so right if you can get

446
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,959
every day up into the red here it would

447
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,639
be a very consistent uh grow environment

448
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,119
they're thereby impacting the natural

449
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,879
products produced

450
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,480
and then the final pillar here is post

451
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,000
harvest so once the plant's been

452
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,759
harvested how can we maintain these

453
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,759
levels of bioactive metabolites

454
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,360
this is a

455
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,359
very well-known company in the cannabis

456
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,680
space called boveda

457
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,919
they like to say that this will maintain

458
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,519
the freshness of your cannabis but more

459
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,919
than anything and what this does is it

460
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,919
stabilizes the humidity of the storage

461
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:12,000
space and this matters because

462
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:15,919
depending on how dry or even the method

463
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you use to dry you can get different

464
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,559
amounts of terpenes and cannabinoids now

465
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
this data here this was done in

466
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,599
collaboration with a company called the

467
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
meter group they make

468
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,159
sensors for the environment

469
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
um

470
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:31,120
and and in food storage but what we did

471
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,600
was we took first one the same variety

472
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,480
called white cap and we dried it to two

473
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,480
different humidity levels

474
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
so that's an orange and green and so

475
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,039
what you see is

476
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,758
depending on the dryness of the flower

477
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,519
you get different levels of cannabinoids

478
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,199
and then if you look within

479
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,600
the colored blocks these are just

480
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,919
different methods used to dry the flower

481
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
itself so depending on the way that you

482
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,078
dry it and

483
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,360
to what degree you dry it you get

484
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,439
different cannabinoid profiles

485
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,959
so to sort of summarize all that right

486
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,199
now the pharmaceutical industry and the

487
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,199
fda is natural product shy

488
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,318
and botanical cannabis is currently too

489
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,400
variable to offer what's needed for

490
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,240
clinical trials in an actual fda

491
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,360
approval of medicine

492
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,759
however we can overcome that by

493
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,000
controlling the genetics that you grow

494
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,078
uh controlling the growth environment as

495
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,838
as well as um

496
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,078
the post-harvest process

497
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,079
um and you know i believe strongly that

498
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,319
advances in technology can change these

499
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,000
first few statements and get the fda to

500
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,720
maybe consider

501
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,960
botanical derived cannabis as a as a

502
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,160
medicine

503
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,919
i want to

504
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,960
acknowledge the whole team at dewey as

505
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,440
well as

506
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,919
connor from the meter group

507
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,720
along with the great research that sort

508
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,520
of

509
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,679
fit the story that i just told

510
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,420
and i will open up to any questions that

511
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:03,979
you might have

512
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:03,979
[Applause]

513
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
yeah for the most part we do breeding um

514
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,639
we're breeding we're a genetics company

515
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,759
yeah we leverage the genome to make

516
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,000
informed

517
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,319
and smarter breeding decisions we don't

518
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,839
have to grow plants up the full 12 weeks

519
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,159
to

520
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,839
you know identify a phenotype we can

521
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,000
do a dna extraction at week two and

522
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,918
identify oh this is going to be a plant

523
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,480
that produces high amounts of osamine

524
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,480
for example

525
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,359
yeah so we we are a washington based

526
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,280
producer processor we we offer genetics

527
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,678
to folks in washington we also have a

528
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,038
cannabis brand in the state

529
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,120
largely what we're doing right now is

530
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,519
focusing on the traits that help the

531
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,359
farmer reduce the inputs overall inputs

532
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,558
that go into the crop

533
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,839
by having

534
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,798
plants that are

535
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,798
genetically stronger

536
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:06,250
[Music]

537
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,440
yeah the water activity yep

538
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,440
yes

539
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,879
drawing techniques yeah absolutely so i

540
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,600
actually believe that that

541
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,760
those that data was for thc uh not total

542
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,678
cannabinoids but yeah we you know in our

543
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,359
lab we test for 16

544
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,440
unique cannabinoids so we could break

545
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,439
that down to to the exact molecule yeah

546
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,038
all right well oh another question

547
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,399
ah there you go

548
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,399
gotta get on the mic

549
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,519
is there any data for led differences

550
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,200
actually or hydro as well

551
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,879
sorry grow media have you seen any data

552
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,759
at all have you guys done any data on

553
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,720
led or hydro grows

554
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,200
so

555
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,200
we have run experiments um

556
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,558
i'm guessing with hydro do you mean you

557
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,000
know

558
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,918
yeah yeah so so

559
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,359
exposed root in like a an ebb and flow

560
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,759
system or more with like you know

561
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,479
controlled drip system in a uh called

562
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,480
rock wool or coco

563
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,480
okay yeah um sort of the gutter model we

564
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,400
don't have any data comparing those

565
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,558
sources we do have data comparing sort

566
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,720
of native soil to greenhouse soil uh

567
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,240
compared to cocoa

568
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,720
we haven't seen major differences

569
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,120
largely it is in the terpenes

570
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,759
you know our hypothesis is that the the

571
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,839
microbial community impacts uh sort of

572
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,480
the secondary metabolites whether it's

573
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,480
cannabinoids or terpenes

574
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,759
all the humidity levels what's the range

575
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,000
like how tight do you have to keep that

576
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,558
range on the humidity in the drying in

577
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,200
in the drying room yeah yeah to have yes

578
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:06,158
so right we call it the sweet zone it's

579
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,000
anywhere from 55 to 65

580
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,919
is sort of the

581
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,919
at least you know from a

582
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,200
a recreational cannabis user

583
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,360
um

584
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,679
that that is going to be the desirable

585
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,519
flower anything over that 65 percent

586
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,280
you're you're enabling mold or bacteria

587
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,359
to grow on the product anything below

588
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,639
that 55 percent level sort of just is

589
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,000
like a dusty

590
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,320
not high high grade product um so you

591
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,640
know aim for somewhere in that that zone

592
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,558
and what we've seen is the relative

593
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,159
humidity of the room after a set amount

594
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,200
of time is going to be the relative

595
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,440
humidity of that that flower itself um

596
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,759
right it's it's sort of uh just

597
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,759
thermodynamic equilibrium that's

598
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,759
occurring

599
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,679
a good genetics like what what defines

600
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,919
the genetics is it like the stability of

601
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,038
it or is it the likelihood of it being

602
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,440
expressed under certain conditions

603
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,279
yeah i think number one is stability um

604
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,720
i think when most at least cannabis

605
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,359
growers talk about stability their

606
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,440
number one concern is is this cultivar

607
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,000
going to produce male flowers on

608
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,519
accident is it going to herm thereby

609
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
rooting the crop that's that's the first

610
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,480
thing to really consider

611
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,880
beyond that you know

612
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,360
our approach is let's make the farmer

613
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,280
happy first um so right we focus on

614
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,199
traits like disease resistance uh

615
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:51,200
whether it's it's powdery mildew or

616
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,200
fungal other fungal molds or insects

617
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,439
okay i don't know if if i'm on or not

618
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,599
but um i think i am

619
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,159
so how do you deliver the genetics to

620
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,158
your customers are you delivering

621
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,080
are you are you using tissue culture i

622
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,559
know you're checking dna is it tissue

623
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,558
cultures are clones i mean what is the

624
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,038
yeah primarily it's primarily it's

625
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,480
clones um and and right we're not a

626
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,038
nursery you know you're not gonna find a

627
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,279
menu of 37 varieties that you can buy

628
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,519
you know up to a thousand strains of uh

629
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,399
we we take a licensing approach we'll

630
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,639
oftentimes deliver a tray of flats

631
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,240
or a flat of clones to uh to our

632
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,200
partners

633
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,200
okay cool yeah

634
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,240
all right well thank you all for uh for

635
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,240
listening
