1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,620
well I've already called a bunch of

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:06,240
friends and I said you have to be there

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,899
next year because this is high level

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,899
networking

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,858
I mean you're getting to talk to the

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,480
people that are innovating that are

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,640
making a huge difference in this

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,980
industry and pushing it forward with a

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,278
lot of Integrity there is no substitute

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,679
for the face-to-face

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,420
opportunities that we've had this week I

12
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,340
can't go to a coffee station without

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,439
meeting somebody else who has a

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,380
fantastic story who would be very

15
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,378
important to what I do or that I'm able

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,000
to help myself it's such a great group

17
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:43,979
of individuals here and you keep seeing

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,320
the same familiar faces time and time

19
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,718
again and it's so intimate that you can

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,759
have a conversation with anybody just by

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,179
walking across the room and saying hi

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:56,159
but I have made you know over a dozen

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,840
new connections that I think are

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,238
meaningful that are bringing

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,820
possibilities to either teaming

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,739
agreements or collaborations on future

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,939
research and development and business

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,219
workings

29
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,199
like one of the most authentic genuine

30
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,298
conferences I've ever attended and I've

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,920
been to many because I've been in the

32
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,880
pharmaceutical industry for over 25

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,740
years this just felt so unique and it

34
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,298
felt like people weren't trying to

35
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,739
impress each other but actually learn

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,640
from each other and so

37
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:28,079
for me that was a it was it was it was

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,478
so inspiring

39
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,780
it's refreshing to come here and see

40
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:36,500
like-minded people who understand the

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,840
future of cannabis we've heard today

42
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,239
information that has not been published

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,180
from the people who are doing that work

44
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,298
and they go into great detail when you

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,579
get them one-on-one

46
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:53,040
into what they're doing later and the

47
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:56,279
strategy behind it and so it's like

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,860
being able to see Over the Horizon and

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,978
know where things are going to be not in

50
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:04,799
weeks and months but a year or two from

51
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,060
now and this is the only place that's

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,259
going to happen

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,319
so

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,319
um

55
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:15,598
appointed by the by the conversation

56
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:18,238
sessions by the op the awesome dinners

57
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:22,579
and networking it's been a fantastic

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,580
experience and I'm so happy that it came

59
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,249
