125
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,000
good afternoon Stacy thank you so much

126
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,439
for joining me on the podcast thanks so

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,279

128
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,598
here we are excited to have you on the

129
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,679
podcast and thrilled to have you back at

130
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:27,240
canmed this year um I know that you were

131
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,840
back with us way back at Harvard Medical

132
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,439
School um and then came out to Pasadena

133
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,079
as well um and then took a few years off

134
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,639
but now we we're excited to have you

135
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,240
back um in your presentation we'll share

136
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,918
data from several clinical trials that

137
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,918
you and your team are performing as part

138
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:48,240
of the Mind program so that's probably a

139
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,959
good place to start tell us a bit about

140
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,439
the Mind program why it was founded and

141
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,680
how its 10 years of research have led

142
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,319
you to this point sure well first I will

143
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,639
say this I'm delighted to be heading

144
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,080
back to kenad this year and yes I was

145
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,240
part of early early caned meetings and

146
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,959
thought and still think it's um really

147
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,840
one of the best meetings there there is

148
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:13,120
um and I think it's a great opportunity

149
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,878
to interact with people from lots of

150
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,240
different areas um related to cannabis

151
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,560
and cannabinoid based um work so the

152
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,800
Mind program did just celebrate its 10

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,160
year anniversary which seems OD to me um

154
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,240
I will tell you I spent several decades

155
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,520
looking among other things at the impact

156
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,319
of recreational cannabis on different

157
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,758
aspects of function so cognitive

158
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,598
performance and clinical outcome

159
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,240
measures of brain structure and function

160
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,800
you name it and we had done lots of

161
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,960
different studies again looking at the

162
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,759
impact of recreational cannabis and when

163
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:46,120
Massachusetts was on the precipice of

164
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,800
legalizing medical cannabis I scoured

165
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,680
the literature I thought let me see what

166
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,360
do we know about the long-term effects

167
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,959
of medical cannabis because as you

168
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,120
probably know cannabis was Rel legalized

169
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,680
in this country in 1996 in California

170
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
and despite that interestingly enough

171
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,360
there really was nothing in the

172
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,240
literature nothing at all about

173
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,479
long-term effects of medical cannabis

174
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,840
use I found some evidence for certain

175
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:10,478
types of studies that looked at you know

176
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:13,560
sort of a a quick and dirty if you will

177
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,519
um assessment of cognition as part of a

178
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,680
different kind of very short type of

179
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,439
study but nothing that was long-term

180
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,439
nothing that followed patients over time

181
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,000
and certainly nothing that looked at

182
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,519
cognition or clinical outcomes as a

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,120
primary focus and so I launched

184
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,240
marijuana investigations for

185
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,360
neuroscientific discovery or the Mind

186
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,278
program with the singular focus of

187
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,800
looking at the long-term impact of

188
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,399
medical cannabis use and at the time I

189
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,838
think a number of people were sort of

190
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,000
like well you know you can do what you

191
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,279
you can try to look at these folks over

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,240
time but these are primarily

193
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,320
recreational people who are really just

194
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,360
looking for a legal way to use cannabis

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,839
and I I first and foremost I would say

196
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,039
that that was absolutely positively

197
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,279
untrue I knew it then and I can now I

198
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,319
can really point to you and say

199
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:03,720
absolutely it's it's not true um so it's

200
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,040
been an extremely important um program I

201
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,560
think it's still the only one like it in

202
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,199
the country and it's home to what we

203
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,119
call a number of Firsts we were the

204
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,360
first ever to do long-term assessments

205
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,399
so we look at patients before they begin

206
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,360
using medical cannabis and that's really

207
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,200
important so people have different types

208
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,480
of indications or conditions whether

209
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,560
it's chronic pain anxiety or mood

210
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,159
disruption sleep disruption you name it

211
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,759
but we look at them before they begin

212
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,078
using medical cannabis products then we

213
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,240
follow them over time they use any old

214
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:33,799
products they would like to use and we

215
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,959
have those products analyzed by an

216
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,199
outside lab so we know quote what's in

217
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,639
your weat um that's because it's not a

218
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,360
clinical trial and I'm not controlling

219
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,000
what's given to them but then we can of

220
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,600
course look at their exposure to

221
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,078
different canabo over time which is

222
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,399
incredibly helpful in the meantime we're

223
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,879
looking at primary outcomes like chronic

224
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,839
pain like mood like sleep and then of

225
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,360
course measures of cognitive performance

226
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,040
and thankfully measures of brain

227
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,200
structure function quality of life Etc

228
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,599
and I think that again some of these

229
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,120
first step mind um has has sort of been

230
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,040
fortunate enough to to put on the map um

231
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,078
should be really

232
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,639
just what I would call the beginning of

233
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,599
the story right this is just a tip of

234
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,240
the iceberg so yes we're the first ever

235
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,040
to look at long-term outcome and

236
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,000
cognitive performance and first ever to

237
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,838
do imaging first to do some of these

238
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,240
clinical trials all of which are

239
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,040
informed by these long-term

240
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,799
observational studies they tell us the

241
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,319
directions that we need to focus on on

242
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,479
patients have always been our greatest

243
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,600
source of information they lead the way

244
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,079
we follow them which is a little

245
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,959
backwards in terms of medicine right

246
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:43,000
it's not usual but we do it um so it's

247
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:47,078
been an incredibly rewarding time um and

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,480
I think the program is unbelievably um

249
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:51,359
helpful and now has really expanded so

250
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,200
it's um it's been it's been a great

251
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,879
journey so far great so you mentioned

252
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,600
there was a lack of long-term studies

253
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,720
how long are we

254
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,839
talking so in ter terms of the types of

255
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,480
longitudinal studies that we're doing

256
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,600
yeah so if you look at the literature

257
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,440
again we were we were looking at

258
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,399
legalization here in Massachusetts in

259
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,360
2012 and there was nothing in literature

260
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,519
our first studies were designed to look

261
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,320
at individuals up to one year and again

262
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,159
I had a lot of people say good luck

263
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,680
they'll never stay well uh we have the

264
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,319
opposite problem which is that once we

265
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,319
begin looking at people over time and

266
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,480
establish relationships and people come

267
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,480
in and we have these very comprehensive

268
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,079
assessments they're interested in

269
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,519
connected so we started off looking at

270
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,439
outcome between Baseline and 3 months 6

271
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,240
months and 12 months and every month um

272
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,639
our team contacts them and we get an

273
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,278
idea of what they're using how they're

274
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,879
using frequency magnitude all that stuff

275
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,399
but these in-depth assessments at the

276
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,480
Milestone visits then we went out to two

277
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,078
years then three years now we're

278
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,159
following people all the way out to five

279
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,919
years which is amazing amazing so that's

280
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,240
really

281
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:00,439
lucky excellent and so and so what are

282
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,000
you finding with some of these long-term

283
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,880
uh studies the first longitudinal

284
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,278
observational study was pretty General I

285
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,320
didn't want to limit it to people with

286
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,958
any specific indication although I had

287
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,440
thought about it like maybe just folks

288
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,159
with pain or just folks with anxiety we

289
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,000
are a psychiatric hospital this is what

290
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,600
we do 24/7 right all Psychiatry all the

291
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,159
time um but you know I thought opening

292
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,040
it up again the top three conditions for

293
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,319
medical cannabis use in this country are

294
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,719
chronic pain anxiety and mood disruption

295
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,199
then sleep and that's actually what we

296
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,079
see in our cohorts and I would tell you

297
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:32,278
that the most interesting sort of big

298
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,278
take- home messages from the

299
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:37,278
longitudinal observational study so far

300
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,240
is that first and foremost in terms of

301
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,159
people before they begin using their

302
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,278
medical cannabis regimen and over time

303
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,719
generally do not perform worse on

304
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,919
cognitive tasks in fact they look if

305
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,240
anything they look stable or slightly

306
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,759
better from a clinical perspective which

307
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,639
is the most important thing right we're

308
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,799
looking at how they do and how they feel

309
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,680
self-report measures are helpful

310
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,759
examiner driven measures are helpful but

311
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,919
really this is primarily up to what they

312
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,159
think and how they feel they generally

313
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:08,879
report having less chronic pain having

314
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:12,559
less anxiety less sleep disruption so

315
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,919
easier to fall asleep better um uh sleep

316
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,479
coherence or the ability to stay asleep

317
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,519
that's interesting also hugely important

318
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,199
we do see a drop in conventional

319
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,799
medication use again this isn't me

320
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:25,039
saying Hey listen now that you're on

321
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,479
conven now that you're on medical

322
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:30,039
cannabis you should stop with the

323
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,519
opioids no no this is the folks doing it

324
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:34,519
on their own these are medical cannabis

325
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,240
patients who say I don't need the same

326
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,720
level of oxy that I did I don't actually

327
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,278
need any of that drug or this drug at

328
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,959
all and so all we're doing is really I

329
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,399
always say I'm just your faithful scribe

330
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,198
we're just keeping track we're writing

331
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,440
right we're just following you over time

332
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:52,758
so these precipitous drops in um opioids

333
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,120
over-the-counter analgesics or pain

334
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,000
relievers and benzodiazapines which

335
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,320
people often use for things like anxiety

336
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,679
or sleep really interesting to see them

337
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,600
drop again no one's asking them to do it

338
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,599
it's on their own so that's pretty

339
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,440
that's pretty impressive in the pain

340
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,079
realm we certainly see folks having less

341
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,360
chronic pain and less disruption from

342
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,399
pain in terms of how much their pain

343
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,879
distre distresses them or disrupts their

344
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,600
lives how much they feel it's a

345
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,519
disability so that's that's pretty

346
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,639
interesting we don't see the same thing

347
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,639
in a treat we have um a patient group

348
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,720
that we call treatment as usual so these

349
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,680
are patients with the same indications

350
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,360
and conditions as our medical cannabis

351
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,559
patients but who aren't using medical

352
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,320
gas we follow those folks over time too

353
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,278
it's a great comparison group right so

354
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,519
they have chronic pain or anxiety or

355
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,958
sleep dis whatever they have we don't

356
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
really see the same pattern of change

357
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,319
over time in those groups oh so they're

358
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,199
so they're not using cannabis to treat

359
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,920
their right their symptoms interest So

360
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,039
within subjects we see changes right

361
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,799
between Baseline and and you know three

362
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,399
months six months 12 months and then

363
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,958
when you look at the aggregate group of

364
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,559
medical cannabis patients compared to

365
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,278
treatment as usual you don't really see

366
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,958
the same patter patterns so interesting

367
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,879
interesting no and you mentioned too

368
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,119
that you're sort of you're just a scribe

369
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,480
and you're just sort of notating what

370
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,560
the patients are doing so you don't give

371
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,079
any recommendations in terms of dosage

372
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,278
or anything like that so that becomes a

373
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:17,120
really interesting set of questions with

374
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,078
patients and of course you know

375
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,600
individuals who have a fair amount of

376
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:23,078
expertise and knowledge in cannabis and

377
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,519
cannaboid based therapies of course we

378
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:27,278
should be the ones helping people when

379
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,240
they don't know what to do in general

380
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,720
patients decide on their own regimen and

381
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,720
they may get advice or feedback on the

382
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,360
types of products but it's not a

383
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,399
situation and actually I believe it

384
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,879
violates federal law for any of us to

385
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,198
say listen this is how you should take

386
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,120
it what you should take where you should

387
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:44,198
you can't really do that so we may

388
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,278
provide some types of feedback but in

389
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,399
terms of guidance it's generally they're

390
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,559
generally choosing the types of products

391
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,519
that they're interested in using we may

392
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,078
help guide them with regard to specific

393
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,039
questions that they have how do I avoid

394
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,039
having this I don't I don't want to be

395
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,679
high I would just I would just like to

396
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,159
relax I don't but I don't I def don't

397
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,758
want to be high because I have this this

398
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,000
this this okay maybe you're looking for

399
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,399
a product that's not exclusively high in

400
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,278
THC so these kinds of things but it's

401
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,159
never a specific here's what to do and

402
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:13,879
how to do it I can go to jail for that

403
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,679
and or if orange weren't the New Black

404
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,838
it would be a different

405
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,958
story so are you finding that you know

406
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,880
certain indications gravitate towards

407
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:27,239
certain formulations of

408
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:30,799
canono so I think that in general there

409
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,440
are some per ctions in sort of among the

410
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,519
general public like you know if I have

411
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,279
chronic pain I have to have a product

412
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,039
that has this amount of let's say THC or

413
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,639
this ratio of THC to CBD and people

414
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:44,879
often think that um it's going to be

415
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,000
more of a one-size fitall than it really

416
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,278
winds up being so many individual

417
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,919
factors come into play here right so

418
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,879
your own experience with cannabis or

419
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,759
cannabinoids what other medications you

420
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,559
take because there are some pretty

421
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,318
stunning potential drug drug

422
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,278
interactions and anything that's

423
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:02,519
swallowed we worry about that right

424
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:03,639
because once we digest it it has to pass

425
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,759
through the liver and things are

426
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,439
converted into other into other

427
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,959
compounds um genetic liabilities so do

428
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,679
you have a first-degree relative who has

429
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,279
a history of psychosis we want to be

430
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,360
careful about super high TC products or

431
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,279
or even high tonic so I think there's a

432
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,318
lot to be mindful of that said I think

433
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,038
people are generally very interested at

434
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:26,959
least in our studies in not necessarily

435
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:29,720
being intoxicated I say this because we

436
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,279
developed a metric called canak get it

437
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,839
can count like can count where we can

438
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,079
actually

439
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,319
quantify um individual cannaboid

440
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,319
exposure so regardless of the product

441
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:44,558
type whether it's um an oil or an edible

442
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,119
or a vape cartridge we can quantify how

443
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,519
much of each of the cannaboids you might

444
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:49,719
be exposed to in a given week depending

445
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,160
on how much and how often you

446
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,200
use if you look at that data over time

447
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,360
overwhelmingly these folks are exposed

448
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,840
to more um non- intoxicating canab like

449
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:04,279
CBD than THC so they're not really

450
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:06,240
looking exclusively to be to be so

451
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,639
that's that's interesting uh I think

452
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,798
we're seeing more and more of that

453
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,080
people would like to feel better but not

454
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,279
necessarily to not feel like themselves

455
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,678
so yeah no one of the things you

456
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,839
mentioned too that kind of stood out and

457
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,720
I know that there's been been some talk

458
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,439
recently on social media and I know that

459
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,159
our our chief science officer has sort

460
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,038
of weighed in on it as well is that

461
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:30,200
there's kind of this growing

462
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:33,879
um uh how do I it there's a a growing

463
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,919
concern about um you know using too much

464
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,840
cannabis leading to psychiatric

465
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,440
disorders like schizophrenia or things

466
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,079
like that and I know that you mentioned

467
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,480
whether or not someone has a history or

468
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:45,519
family history of that just wondering I

469
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,159
mean given your expertise if you want to

470
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:51,240
weigh in on sort of what the risks are

471
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,320
there so it that probably is its own

472
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,319
show we should do our own take this on

473
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,439
the road let's start over let's we're

474
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,918
gonna we're gonna take this on the road

475
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,600
I think there's a lot to be mindful of

476
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,960
listen there there there's no question

477
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,839
that cannabis and cannabinoids if you

478
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,079
ask me have remarkable therapeutic

479
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,079
potential across the board depending on

480
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,399
who you are where you are in life what

481
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,079
else you're using quote what's in your

482
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,320
weed all these things that matter

483
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,798
overwhelmingly um when we think of risk

484
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,759
factors we think of individuals who are

485
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:20,839
more likely vulnerable so our first and

486
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,119
foremost the group that leaps to mind in

487
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:25,000
everybody you know for for everybody

488
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,959
adolescence and emerging adults where we

489
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,839
have a neurodevelopmental vulnerability

490
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,440
the brain is for my C audiences their

491
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,079
brains are half baked they're not quite

492
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,320
done under construction whatever

493
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,480
euphemism you want the brain's not done

494
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:39,319
and so

495
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,558
like any other substance not just

496
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:44,359
cannabis but other substances alcohol

497
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:46,639
illness injury brain is vulnerable and

498
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:49,079
so exposure to different types of things

499
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,400
during that period of time may result in

500
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:53,599
something that's not necessarily optimal

501
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,159
it does appear that the presence of of

502
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,918
THC may impact um neuronal trajectories

503
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,320
during develop it's possible I mean

504
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,400
there's all sorts of things that have

505
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,839
been discussed and assessed and it does

506
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,000
appear that high amounts of different

507
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:12,119
types of cannaboids during this

508
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,119
vulnerable time may not result in the

509
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:16,279
most optimal outcome is it true for

510
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:17,918
everybody probably not where do we draw

511
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,720
the line how much is okay who knows

512
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,280
everybody is different it depends on the

513
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,319
age it depends on so many things I think

514
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,158
we also are mindful on the other end of

515
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,639
the age Spectrum right so the fastest

516
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,799
growing group of cannabis consumers

517
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,360
across this country individuals over 60

518
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,279
or 65 so we're mindful so now we have

519
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,279
slowed

520
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,879
metabolism individuals in that age

521
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,599
bracket are generally on several

522
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,679
conventional medications somewhere

523
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,678
between three and five so drug drug

524
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,960
interactions are a thing um and and

525
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,559
we're mindful of

526
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,240
clearance so I I think when we think of

527
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,240
the risks we want to take a big picture

528
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,038
look in terms of psychosis and

529
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,440
psychiatric disorders and conditions I

530
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,000
think that there's been a fair amount

531
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,320
that's been published with regard to the

532
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,319
fact that there appear to be

533
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,079
associations between cannabis use and

534
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:05,599
different psychiatric conditions

535
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:07,599
symptoms or clusters not necessarily

536
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,798
causation exac servation of symptoms

537
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,959
sure causation not so much right so and

538
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,278
that's really important and and I think

539
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,038
people don't always hear that part of

540
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:18,240
the message just because they're

541
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:19,839
Associated sometimes people who don't

542
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,558
necessarily feel so great or comfortable

543
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,599
in their own skin are more likely to use

544
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:25,200
things to quote Escape their current

545
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,119
state of being or to feel different that

546
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,400
doesn't mean that that's what caused it

547
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:33,678
right so important distinction

548
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,679
absolutely absolutely okay um so kind of

549
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,960
I guess kind of circling up on the

550
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,880
longitudinal or observational studies

551
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,720
what are the limitations of these sort

552
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,080
of

553
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,640
studies longitudinal studies or

554
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,079
observational studies in general have

555
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,720
lots of limitations um including the the

556
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,240
most obvious which is that you can't

557
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,679
necessarily always say that what you're

558
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,519
seeing that's different over time as a

559
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,880
result of just Canabis sometimes people

560
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,960
Implement uh or you know sort of start a

561
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,400
new cannabis or medical cannabis right

562
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,400
and at the same time they're also doing

563
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,798
other things potentially that we

564
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,000
wouldn't know about how do I know it's

565
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,359
just the medical cannabis you don't so

566
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,200
you do your best to control for

567
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,000
everything else we ask that people don't

568
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,360
start other medications or this or that

569
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,440
you do your best um it's not as powerful

570
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,639
or as clearcut as a clinical trial where

571
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,840
we're looking at a specific study drug

572
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,159
or series of study drugs right that I

573
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,000
have formulated in the case of my

574
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,919
clinical trials I formulate the actual

575
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,798
products used in observational studies

576
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,038
usually patients are using whatever ever

577
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:34,038
they choose to use and it's great that

578
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:36,079
we can actually get um laboratory

579
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,519
analyses of quote what's in their weed

580
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,240
but it would be a little bit better if

581
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,400
we knew sort of a priority what we were

582
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,480
giving and how um and we're looking at

583
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,798
something before and then after so it's

584
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,679
a little less clear but that said I mean

585
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:49,519
again these longer term studies really

586
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,200
give us a trajectory of what people look

587
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,639
like over time and interestingly enough

588
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,880
individuals in our clinical trials very

589
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,759
often um wind up signing up for the

590
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,000
observation stud so we get to see those

591
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,839
people long term and how they do after

592
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,919
being on a clinical trial and then sort

593
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,918
of migrating or evolving into a

594
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,679
different type of therapy maybe a

595
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,799
conventional a more conventional um

596
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,240
therapy or a medical cannabis product

597
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,440
that's in the marketplace and what they

598
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,919
look like so you can actually compare

599
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,640
them that's interesting um but there's

600
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,600
def there's shortcomings with every type

601
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,520
of approach you do the best that you can

602
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,879
corre but I tell you this if you don't

603
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,158
look you you you don't know um and I

604
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,320
have a very strongly held belief that

605
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,440
real world patients using Real World

606
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:38,480
products give us a really good sense of

607
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,400
real world outcome yeah and that type of

608
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,000
data helps guide me when I'm thinking of

609
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,519
the next stage for clinical trials like

610
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,240
oh patients say they're using this and

611
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,400
not that and here's why we should be

612
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,120
thinking about this or a lot of folks

613
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,000
complain about this this this we should

614
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:56,359
look at that there again um they really

615
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
are guiding uh the charge in many cases

616
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:01,439
as opposed to somebody discovering

617
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,200
something you know um at their at their

618
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,278
bench and going who we should try this

619
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,519
in this population patients are doing it

620
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,880
we go we should look at

621
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,319
that so you've mentioned a few times

622
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,440
that you're actually testing the

623
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:15,839
products that the uh that the patients

624
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,558
are using now is that each time that

625
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:23,119
they get a new a new product or how how

626
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,200
frequently that's a great question so

627
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,719
that's been a bit more variable so we

628
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,919
tend to test their most commonly used

629
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,839
products so patients very often again

630
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,480
our real medical cannabis patient cohort

631
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:37,678
that says look I have xyz123 I'm looking

632
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,960
to treat these symptoms and if they find

633
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,519
something that works which generally

634
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,278
happens but as you probably know there's

635
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,480
a little bit of trial and error who

636
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:45,759
wouldn't sample that necessarily you may

637
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,399
want to get it when they have a when

638
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,359
they have a a regimen that really does

639
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:51,798
seem to be consistent and that they feel

640
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,959
is helpful um otherwise you're looking

641
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:56,558
at nothing but sort of change over time

642
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,519
do we test um every time of course not

643
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,440
no it'd be great I mean if could somehow

644
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,038
you know give every single person some

645
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,679
kind of you know bench top thing that

646
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,640
gave me a print out of exactly what

647
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,798
that'd be amazing doesn't work that way

648
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,440
so we do our best it's still better than

649
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:15,558
what we had which was oh yeah nothing um

650
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,880
so you know I I think that's better my

651
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:19,319
my least favorite thing to find in the

652
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,600
literature by some of the most esteemed

653
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:23,558
colleagues I I could ever imagine is

654
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,158
that people ask questions about

655
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:28,000
individuals cannabis use but they never

656
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,960
ask about the actual constituents within

657
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,159
the product prods that's a problem um

658
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,759
because no matter what you're seeing

659
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,240
good or bad we don't necessarily know

660
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,000
what's always driving that and when you

661
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,480
ask patients or recreational consumers

662
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,839
to guesstimate my favorite question well

663
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,360
tell us what you think I mean do you

664
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,918
think it was strong weed have you ever

665
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,158
met anybody who says yeah I really crap

666
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,679
weed it's awful garbage no one says I

667
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,120
have ditch weed no one but it's sort of

668
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,720
like other things that people may

669
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:56,278
overestimate if you know what I mean it

670
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,880
can't always be true so it would be

671
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:01,240
great if when people say we're looking

672
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,440
at you know very high THC product use in

673
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,558
this cohort that you actually confirm

674
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,440
their products are in fact very high in

675
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:09,639
THC I haven't seen that too often

676
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,558
sometimes more recently we're seeing

677
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,399
some of that but that's a limitation in

678
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:16,038
the field for sure excellent all right

679
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:17,918
so moving on to the clinical trials as

680
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:19,440
we mentioned uh you have a number of

681
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,399
different clinical trials that are going

682
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,759
on looking at things like anxiety

683
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:26,319
bipolar disorder Alzheimer's related

684
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,558
dementia so um soing you could share

685
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,879
some details about that I know you're

686
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:29,839
going to be talking about it CED so you

687
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,000
probably don't want to give away too

688
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,480
much but uh what you are willing to

689
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,960
share please sure oh I'm I'm I'm willing

690
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,440
to share plenty so um our very first

691
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,480
clinical trial was designed to look at

692
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,960
patients with moderate to severe anxiety

693
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,399
and it was designed to be a whole plant

694
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,558
full spectrum product with a relatively

695
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:49,719
high amount of CBD compared for sure to

696
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:52,079
THC but not no THC not a broad spectrum

697
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,919
product a full spectrum product um and

698
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,240
it was designed to be a relatively short

699
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,960
trial um we actually wound up having

700
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,359
three arms so it's a whole Plan full SP

701
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,919
product um and a placebo and then um an

702
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,000
actual isolate that comes from that base

703
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,840
now that's a challenge so not just any

704
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,038
old isolate that's CBD right an actual

705
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,759
CBD isol that came from the same base

706
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,558
from which the study product that study

707
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,119
is wrapping we just enrolled our last

708
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,558
patient we've published the open label

709
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:25,879
data which I will review probably a can

710
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:28,678
um but that was the very first one and

711
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,039
um it's been a really really um

712
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,720
important study or set of St the open

713
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,158
label really helped to inform the double

714
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,558
blind phase we then did the same type of

715
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,360
study with an industry partner using a

716
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:41,798
hemp based um product that um we're in

717
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,759
the process of writing up now with

718
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:48,359
regard to open label anxiety features

719
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:50,798
into so many different conditions um it

720
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:54,079
it's a really important thing to assess

721
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,679
in people with lots of different um

722
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,480
either General medical conditions or

723
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,798
psychiatric conditions right it's not

724
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,679
just primary anxiety it's people with um

725
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,398
for example patients with gleo blastoma

726
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,679
an incurable brain tumor right

727
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:09,038
incredibly serious and lethal we're

728
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,798
looking at chronic pain and anxiety and

729
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,720
then an exploratory aim is tumor

730
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,798
progression because if we've done it

731
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,600
right maybe knock on wood maybe will

732
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,599
help to slow or even stop the

733
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,278
progression of the disease there's every

734
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:24,519
indication based on preclinical work um

735
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:27,679
that that is potentially possible here

736
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,480
um we have the very first study uh of of

737
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,320
patients with bipolar disorder using a

738
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,079
whole PL broadspectrum product U so you

739
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,480
know I think there's there's lots of

740
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,439
different um different ways to get at

741
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,399
this and I think there are so many

742
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,679
different areas of Interest these days

743
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,518
and so much of them or so many of them

744
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,798
overlap and intersect but they are

745
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,240
different um and we've we've certainly

746
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,119
learned a lot in patients who have

747
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,200
Alzheimer's related dementia very often

748
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,359
they do have

749
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:59,200
anxiety um along with other things and

750
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:01,038
how does that necessar how how can a

751
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,038
product that's high in CBD that maybe

752
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,640
contain some THC but not a ton although

753
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,038
some people like a lot of THC in that

754
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,240
population um how do those folks look

755
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,000
over over a period of time all of these

756
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,200
things you know it's important to have

757
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,480
empirically sound data so that's why we

758
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,240
do it yeah so how did you go about you

759
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,759
know kind of deciding what the

760
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,120
formulation would be for some of these

761
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:27,119
indications great question um so for the

762
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,959
first one I knew I I had actually come

763
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,798
across a product in California that I

764
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,278
thought would be particularly promising

765
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,158
that actually is a cannabis based

766
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:34,919
product but would have met the

767
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,519
definition at that time forh this is way

768
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,480
back when way way way wa wait um and

769
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,240
when I wrote my first IND and was

770
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,120
approved by the FDA and our IRB I mean

771
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,480
this is a long time go um it that

772
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,518
product would have meant the definition

773
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,000
of industrial hemp and the DEA came

774
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,319
along and said this is great we think we

775
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,558
can approve except you can't use that I

776
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,639
mean it's not like you could go to a

777
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:56,960
candy machine and say instead of a

778
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,720
Snickers I'm going to get a kick out

779
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,960
nope so you have to go back to the

780
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,600
drawing board um I knew that I wanted

781
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,759
something that was a whole plant full

782
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:08,359
spectrum product given um the likely

783
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:11,798
impact of some of the so-called minor

784
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:14,439
canabo um and the question was how to do

785
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:16,879
it in such a way that would be palatable

786
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,038
tolerable and likely efficacious that

787
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,399
was the big question and you know

788
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:21,879
whether you're going to use an Emulsion

789
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:23,719
or an infusion like you know all these

790
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,799
things and you know I'm a neuroscientist

791
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm not a chemist necessarily that trade

792
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,839
although I spend a lot of time now um

793
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,479
um with with compounds and chemicals and

794
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,398
it's been some of the most glorious work

795
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,679
I've ever done and it's so exciting um

796
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,359
but really it has to do with trying to

797
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,120
understand how to best leverage some of

798
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,959
these naturally occurring compounds M so

799
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:47,719
the whole goal of mind with regard to

800
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,159
the clinical child's arm is to sort of

801
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,038
explore and I wouldn't the term exploit

802
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,278
sounds um unfortunately negative but to

803
00:30:53,038 --> 00:31:00,278
to to Really leverage the potential

804
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:03,038
Therapeutics of these of these compounds

805
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:05,638
and reduce risk in harm so we don't

806
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:08,558
really want people super altered in many

807
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:10,199
cases they really can't be um and so

808
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,558
that's that's sort of the trick mitigate

809
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,080
risk and harm but increase the

810
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:18,519
likelihood of clinical efficacy right

811
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,918
so high CBD um I mean if you're saying

812
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,200
that it would have kind of fit the

813
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:27,159
definition for industrial hemp then it's

814
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:30,360
below that. 3% THC right so our first

815
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:33,039
study was conducted using a product that

816
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,199
I created that has you you could have

817
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,519
had 10 times the amount of THC in that

818
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,519
product and still been below limit after

819
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,240
four weeks half of my sample tested

820
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,359
positive for THC on urinary drug assays

821
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,240
so they would have they would have

822
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,959
failed the urine screen not one of them

823
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,038
of course was intoxicated or altered

824
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,159
sort of underscoring the importance of

825
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,759
why we can't use a per se law for

826
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,120
example like the presence of this means

827
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,240
they're intoxicated or impaired no of

828
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,959
course not of course it doesn't that one

829
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,319
person reported feeling altered or

830
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,759
intoxicated or altered at all um but yes

831
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:08,918
that that product is technically canis

832
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:11,960
but it just so happens to have extremely

833
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:14,080
low levels of THC but trust me when I

834
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,600
tell you it was sourced my original

835
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,000
thing was sourced by naida they didn't

836
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:21,558
give me anything that was TurnKey I had

837
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,440
to make it they gave me a um it was a

838
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:25,879
rather sludgy oilbased product um that

839
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,480
was a challenge I would say

840
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,399
diplomatically this is a family-friendly

841
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,880
it uh it was a challenge to work with

842
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:35,038
and so that was not the easiest thing

843
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,240
ever um but we did wind up making it

844
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,919
into a sublingual tincture my feeling is

845
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,638
sublingual tinctures are probably the

846
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,278
way to go for these things at least um

847
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:45,558
that's been where we've spent a fair

848
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,880
amount of time because of the increased

849
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:49,599
bioavailability that's afforded that way

850
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,159
as opposed to taking a capsule or just

851
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:56,918
swallowing something so interesting um

852
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,840
so have you encountered any regulatory

853
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:00,720
or logistical you think you mentioned

854
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:03,720
some of the logistical hurdles but

855
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,278
regulatory hurdles I mean the fact that

856
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,120
they said you know the FDA once the FDA

857
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,720
approves it the indd then you have to

858
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:14,079
actually post your clinical trial

859
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,480
information on something called clinical

860
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,439
trials.com and patients who are rather

861
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,278
desperate across the country are you

862
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,440
know sort of living on these sites and

863
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:25,880
they'll call you and sign up and say let

864
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,840
me in let me in the IRB had approved it

865
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:32,240
but of course the DEA said not so fast

866
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:35,759
grber so that was a bit of a challenge

867
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,960
um and a rather untenable position to

868
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:38,519
have been placed in because you have

869
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,679
patients who are desperate I have

870
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,519
product that's made but I can't use it

871
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,159
can't use it couldn't use any of it I

872
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,759
still have it on the top shelf of my

873
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,799
office because it's a

874
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:51,519
reminder never count your chickens

875
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:54,278
uh it took I mean a quick you know just

876
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,880
a quick um what was it almost two years

877
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:57,319
uh from that point until we actually

878
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,320
enrolled our first patient when I had to

879
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:00,319
go back to drawing board and start over

880
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:03,278
I would say that was a little bit of a

881
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:07,638
hurdle um certainly a mogul I mean you

882
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:10,280
know was thing um listen we have had

883
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:11,598
extremely good and positive interactions

884
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,519
with each of the agencies and they've

885
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,320
been very helpful I think for many many

886
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,199
um reasons there was a lot of learning

887
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,559
that had to happen on both sides I mean

888
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,358
I I think I understood a little bit

889
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,279
better than they did I tried to help

890
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,639
them along and it took a long time and

891
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,040
I'm still we're still not really where

892
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,320
we need to be I don't think that's any

893
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:32,079
surprise but I that was a bit of a

894
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,359
challenge to be honest a bit of a yeah

895
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,879
and then you mentioned you're sort of

896
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,878
comparing the full spectrum products to

897
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:41,279
the isolates um what sort of differences

898
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,239
and results are you seeing there so we

899
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,560
haven't actually analyzed that data as I

900
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:47,838
mentioned we just enrolled our last so I

901
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:49,398
I don't know my feeling is that a whole

902
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:53,078
plant full spectrum product would be

903
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:55,838
more efficacious relative to Placebo for

904
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:58,320
sure and likely more more efficacious

905
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,279
than the isolate form and it isolate

906
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,119
from that same disent which is not at

907
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,519
all what you see when you see isol dorms

908
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:04,680
it's completely they're like and people

909
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,320
say well it's the same doesn't matter

910
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,519
where you get it I I don't I don't think

911
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,880
necessarily that's true so that would be

912
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,880
my guess but I don't know um certainly

913
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,000
we see a lot of clinical benefit in

914
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,680
individuals who are using a whole plant

915
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,039
full or broads Spectrum relative to

916
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:23,679
people who are using quote just CBD or

917
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:26,920
just something else um probably for good

918
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:28,159
reasons mechanistically probably

919
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,320
excellent

920
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,799
um I did want to ask you about um the

921
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,119
Women's Health Initiative at mind uh

922
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,760
it's mentioned in your abstract as

923
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,640
something that you guys are looking into

924
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,359
or sort of expanding into um so please

925
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,279
share about that and sort of what what

926
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,119
conditions you're looking at there yeah

927
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,560
whim or the Women's Health Initiative at

928
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,160
mine I just wanted something that was

929
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,199
catchy where I could say not just a whim

930
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:56,199
um so you know over a billion you're

931
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:59,118
always with the puns I try I really try

932
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:01,399
um over a billion individuals are

933
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,640
affected by things like gynecologic pain

934
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,639
in this country it's largely

935
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,799
understudied this is an underserved

936
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:11,639
population for a million different

937
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,400
reasons and there are lots of reasons to

938
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:15,799
explore the potential application of

939
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,960
cannabis and cannabinoids in these

940
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,240
conditions for example we did a number

941
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,199
of survey based studies these were my

942
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,919
first real survey based studies I done a

943
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,799
little bit of work in this area before

944
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,440
but it come in with um per menop

945
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,359
menopausal and postmenopausal disruption

946
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,358
and things like um cannabis or

947
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:39,799
cannaboids we did a survey study that

948
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:41,480
was a bit of an adjacent clinical um uh

949
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,079
investigation individuals who are using

950
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,240
a commercially available vaginal

951
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:49,318
suppository for uh menstrual related

952
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:52,199
dysfunction and we now have our very

953
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:54,519
first uh project that's funded to look

954
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,358
at women with endometriosis using a

955
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:59,000
whole plant full spectrum product that I

956
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:01,799
made for folks endometriosis and related

957
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,159
pain so there's a lot of interest here

958
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,640
and people are using these products the

959
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,480
problem that I often hear about is

960
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,279
patients will tell you you know I don't

961
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,119
know my friend used this so I figured

962
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,200
I'll just try well wouldn't it be great

963
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,400
to actually have data that could help

964
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,960
individuals be informed about what

965
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,358
products they should and maybe shouldn't

966
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,519
be exploring I don't know just a thought

967
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:26,078
um so that's that's I think a a rather

968
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:28,519
exciting area again endometriosis is is

969
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,560
one of those conditions that so many are

970
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:34,759
affected by so many are affected by yeah

971
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:36,279
and the number of symptoms is rather

972
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,839
staggering when you really start looking

973
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,440
at the data and so if you can improve

974
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:42,838
the quality of life and you can reduce

975
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,720
discomfort and increase people's ability

976
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,519
to sleep and be less again either less

977
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:49,439
anxious or have less pain or all of the

978
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,000
above why wouldn't you

979
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,960
try no it's interesting you mentioned

980
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,679
endometriosis we did have a presenter

981
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,960
last year uh who talked about that and

982
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:00,559
it was sort of more

983
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,519
exploratory of you know could cannaboids

984
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:05,078
potentially be a good treatment option

985
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,719
um and it sounds like now you're

986
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:08,680
actually investigating that so that's

987
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,639
that's fantastic there's every reason to

988
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:13,239
think so given the relationship between

989
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,679
the endoc canabo system this endogenous

990
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:16,399
system you know of chemicals and

991
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:18,960
receptors throughout the brain and body

992
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,720
and the and the gynecologic system right

993
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,039
so again when we think of the ways that

994
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:26,159
we all sort of wired why wouldn't you

995
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:28,279
try to harness the most powerful things

996
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,239
that you could that are po potentially

997
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,960
less invasive or less quote disruptive

998
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,759
to other things um you know if it isn't

999
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,960
likely to do a ton of harm and could

1000
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,760
potentially help I'm all for trying to

1001
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,480
see what what we get so excellent all

1002
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,680
right all right I do want to be mindful

1003
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,920
of your time Stacy so um one of the

1004
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,838
questions I kind of wanted to maybe uh

1005
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,358
kind of conclude with is um with all the

1006
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:52,679
work that you've done from studying

1007
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:54,159
medical cannabis patients you know what

1008
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:56,279
lessons have you learned that should

1009
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,679
maybe inform public policy or

1010
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,400
regulations going forward

1011
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,519
you know I I think one of the most

1012
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,440
important things that leaps to mind and

1013
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:05,838
and a number of my very esteemed

1014
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,119
colleagues and friends have published on

1015
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:12,880
this as well um you know very often PE

1016
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,920
people are invested and I mean literally

1017
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,400
in figuratively in buying products that

1018
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,440
are designed to help with this or that

1019
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,358
and they spend lots of money and

1020
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,000
unfortunately we know that what is on

1021
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:26,719
the label isn't necessarily what's

1022
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,880
contained in the product it's a problem

1023
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:29,199
it's a problem

1024
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,039
because the quote what's in your weed

1025
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,439
Factor should translate to hey it's

1026
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,318
supposed to be 50 mies per Mill it

1027
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,240
should have around that right so for

1028
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:38,119
people who are on a super fixed budget

1029
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,879
I'm thinking of our older cohorts we

1030
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,599
have a very large older adult study that

1031
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,920
we did for a year these people will scr

1032
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,240
and save to buy these products that are

1033
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,559
sometimes you know North of1 $150 an

1034
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:52,318
ounce and they wind up containing very

1035
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:54,519
little active canabo there's very little

1036
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:56,480
in terms of gr canab noids on the other

1037
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:59,119
side in terms of what shouldn't be in

1038
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,358
there right a toxins heavy metals mold

1039
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,599
yeast I think that it's it's important

1040
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:07,000
for people to be mindful of the the

1041
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,359
safety and and sort of the the oversight

1042
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,358
that we do need to have with some of

1043
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:14,440
these products it's important um that's

1044
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:17,719
a big one I think um again the same

1045
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:21,480
rules and concerns for individuals who

1046
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:25,919
are vulnerable at let's say our you the

1047
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,719
the the the earlier age um folks who are

1048
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,519
exploring cannabis or canab and we're

1049
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,559
mindful of their brain and this

1050
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,719
developmental vulnerability it doesn't

1051
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:37,559
appear that we have the same quote story

1052
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,679
that gets translated over the lifespan

1053
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:41,880
so individuals who come to cannabis lat

1054
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,598
in life older adults who are let's just

1055
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,680
say beyond the period of vulnerability

1056
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,160
right now on the other side so brains

1057
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,639
fully developed now we're losing things

1058
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:50,879
because we're older um it doesn't appear

1059
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,759
that there's the same potential

1060
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,760
decrement in for example cognitive

1061
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,280
performance that we spent decades

1062
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,359
documenting in our recreational

1063
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,880
consumers our older medical cannabis

1064
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:02,239
folks sometimes not only look stable

1065
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,318
they look better we see structural brain

1066
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,679
changes after the initiation of medical

1067
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:08,400
cannabis products so I think that's

1068
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:10,239
really interesting so how that will

1069
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,680
shake out in terms of public policy will

1070
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,399
be interesting there certainly lots of

1071
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,879
very strongly

1072
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:19,000
held opinions and thoughts about that

1073
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:21,440
these days so be interesting to see sure

1074
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,079
that amongst other things no and you me

1075
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,200
science we should let science guide the

1076
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,480
conversations though no that does sound

1077
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,919
like a good idea let the not your not

1078
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,240
your thoughts and your feelings what you

1079
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,639
think and how you feel but what the

1080
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,919
actual data show us I think that's

1081
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,759
important absolutely no and you and you

1082
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,480
make a good point about you know the

1083
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,200
concerns of is what's on the label

1084
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,719
really in your product um and you know

1085
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,439
make sure there's other contaminant and

1086
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,838
I just have to think of the

1087
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,599
conversations I've been having with

1088
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:50,838
folks about hemp derived uh cannaboid

1089
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,359
products and how they're not as

1090
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:55,480
regulated and you know they may be more

1091
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:58,318
available they may be more affordable

1092
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,519
but there is there is a risk there so

1093
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,838
there's two things right in the hemp

1094
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,800
space uh one you're exactly right

1095
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:05,759
there's little to no regulation and we

1096
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,079
certainly should have some oversight in

1097
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,640
the meantime patients and consumers

1098
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,039
should be asking for coas like you know

1099
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:13,799
no before you go what are you looking

1100
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:15,358
for what the goal of use and then ask

1101
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,240
for a COA so you know what's in your

1102
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,558
weed so a certificate of analysis that's

1103
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,439
quote matched to the batch not just any

1104
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:22,559
old COA that came three years ago from

1105
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,280
some product that's made by the same

1106
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,559
company uhuh the actual product you have

1107
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,119
in your hand they should really have and

1108
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,359
and more responsible and well respected

1109
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,920
vendors really do have that available

1110
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,920
I'll also tell you that you know for the

1111
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,639
majority of cannabis based dispensaries

1112
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,200
They Don't Really spend most of their

1113
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,440
real estate in the high CBD product

1114
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:43,558
Arena right because that's that's not

1115
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,519
where they're that's not where they're

1116
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:48,079
consumer base is headed that people are

1117
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:50,280
going online for things like that so I I

1118
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,160
think it would be helpful to have people

1119
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,839
understand what to expect and how to

1120
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,639
make their best decisions really

1121
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,078
excellent and now we mentioned that

1122
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,558
you're joining us for canid down in

1123
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,400
Puerto Rico and we're super excited to

1124
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:04,640
have you um so I did want to ask you are

1125
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,519
there any certain types of professional

1126
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,598
professionals or researchers or

1127
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:11,400
attendees that you're looking forward to

1128
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:13,880
connecting with at a great question so

1129
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,000
again canmed always brings together this

1130
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,720
rather remarkable constellation of

1131
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,838
people from different walks of life and

1132
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:23,598
different aspects of this particular

1133
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:26,318
world I always find it really rewarding

1134
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,960
um it's always great to talk to our

1135
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:29,880
partner sort of clinicians and

1136
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,960
colleagues it's amazing and we all share

1137
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,680
these stories and we all agree this is

1138
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,280
such an important area we can't not do

1139
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,879
it you know even though it's really hard

1140
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,559
and getting harder but we we all do it

1141
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,800
um it's incredibly important to join

1142
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:44,760
forces with what I would call the

1143
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,359
responsible industry based folks right

1144
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,680
um it's the way that I feel about

1145
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:51,519
research and clinical work in the best

1146
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:53,838
of all possible worlds clinical work is

1147
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,239
informed by research breakthroughs but

1148
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,119
research breakthroughs are based on

1149
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,479
clinical needs that emerge through pure

1150
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,318
clinical work right so it's the same

1151
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,480
thing and I think that if you're lucky

1152
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:05,400
you have folks in Industry who are

1153
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,039
invested literally and figured in the

1154
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,119
enjoy forces with responsible scientists

1155
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:12,558
and clinician scientists who say look

1156
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:14,119
this is where I see something I have

1157
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,319
this idea or thought maybe there's a way

1158
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,838
to partner because very often it's

1159
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:19,318
really challenging to get these things

1160
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:21,119
funded to move forward you can have the

1161
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:23,279
best ideas in the world if you can't

1162
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,160
Implement them they just sit on a shelf

1163
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,119
so and we know that the ways that these

1164
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,799
things move forward most effectively and

1165
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:34,760
most quickly is usually through private

1166
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,839
um initiatives or or industry right it's

1167
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,400
not necessarily the infrastructure that

1168
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:41,400
is our government Partners to start

1169
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,720
that's not how the Mind program started

1170
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,880
for sure so absolutely yeah so making

1171
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:49,879
those connections uh that's that's the

1172
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:51,358
goal yeah sure all right Stacy One Last

1173
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,240
Thing Before I Let You Go I want to give

1174
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,598
you the opportunity to plug any websit

1175
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,519
social media or any other resources that

1176
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,440
you think the folks who are listening or

1177
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:01,599
watching might be interested in if they

1178
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,000
want to learn more about the work that

1179
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,240
you're doing sure we do have a website

1180
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
it's the mind program.org or just Dr

1181
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:13,118

same Dr Stacy grber uh I'm in

1186
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,480
conversation I think with Tommy Chong of

1187
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,800
chich and Chan about the importance of

1188
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,838
understanding uh the scientific sort of

1189
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,000
