1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,640
thank you so much for having me today

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,500
I'm going to be talking about Delta 8

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,179
some of the earlier talks did talk about

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,879
Delta 8 but more from a product

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,039
perspective Purity issues quality issues

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,260
so today I'm just to talk just about the

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,000
actual molecule itself both from a

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,920
scientific perspective but also from a

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,079
historical perspective

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,400
uh here's my disclosure so we've worked

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,198
with some companies on the pharmacology

12
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,358
of Delta 8 in the past but really we

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,760
have no ownership in any company that

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,320
produces or sells Delta a so no real

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,579
direct conflict of interest I'm not

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,799
trying to promote any particular

17
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,380
cannabinoid

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,140
so interest in Delta a or awareness of

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,520
Delta 8 is something pretty new amongst

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,439
the amongst the the general population

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,440
if you look at just internet searches

22
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,019
for Delta 8 as a measure of awareness or

23
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,820
interest well you see that before 2019

24
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,559
really nobody was searching for it

25
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,320
probably nobody or very few people even

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,119
knew what it was after around 2020 you

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,920
see that interest and searches just kind

28
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,780
of exploded and this this block goes up

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,179
to 2021 but I'm sure that has just

30
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,859
continued to go up uh you see this this

31
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,540
plot is by state you see the States

32
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,640
where there's the most interests or

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,979
actually those States in which Delta 9

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,299
Still Remains illegal at the at the

35
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:13,438
state level which isn't really

36
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,960
surprising

37
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,819
but the fact that awareness of Delta 8

38
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,759
is fairly new has given some people the

39
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,079
impression that Delta 8 as a molecule is

40
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,299
new

41
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,400
and so I read pretty regularly quotes

42
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,840
like this one so this is a quote from an

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,060
article in Forbes that was published

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,400
just this year so it says Delta 9 has

45
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,680
been studied extensively for nearly 60

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,719
years but a little research is published

47
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,540
on Delta 8. well I don't think this is

48
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,879
true at all in fact research on Delta

49
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,560
Aid is not a new thing that's been going

50
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,798
on as you can see from the title of the

51
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,299
talk for over 80 years at this point so

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,880
obviously not quite as much research as

53
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,680
Delta 9 can't compare it to that but but

54
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,438
quite a few studies so we published a

55
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,759
review article on this last year so we

56
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,258
pretty much looked at every single

57
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,019
pharmacology study of Delta eight

58
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,399
there's well over 150 Publications not

59
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,379
getting into the chemistry or anything

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,379
but just getting into actual studies of

61
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,699
the pharmacology of Delta 8 over 150

62
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:09,959
Publications

63
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,818
so I'm going to give you a quick

64
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,860
overview of some of some of the findings

65
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,359
today so first of all what is Delta

66
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,180
eight I think most people in this room

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,920
probably know here's Delta 8 structure

68
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,239
compared to Delta 9 and you see overall

69
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,219
they're they're very similar they're

70
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,560
isomers just one slight difference of

71
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,479
the location of this this double bond

72
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,340
so this gives it just a slightly

73
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,560
different three-dimensional shape so

74
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,120
perhaps Delta 8 can fit into the

75
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,219
cannabinoid receptors a little bit

76
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,719
differently perhaps it can fit in a

77
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,659
little bit differently with the enzymes

78
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,639
that metabolize THC

79
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,620
then there's also one additional layer

80
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,659
of complexity so when you take Edibles

81
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,939
or when you take THC orally it's

82
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,519
metabolized fairly fairly heavily before

83
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,199
THC reaches the general circulation and

84
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,539
one of these metabolites is actually

85
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,818
active so this is the 11-hydroxy

86
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,159
metabolite it's formed both for Delta 8

87
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,539
and for Delta 9. so when we consider

88
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,159
what are the differences between these

89
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,959
two molecules we have to consider not

90
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,639
just the differences in in the parrot

91
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,219
molecules but also is there any

92
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,018
difference in in these metabolites of

93
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:13,620
11-hydroxy Delta 8 compared to

94
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:16,200
11-hydroxy Delta 9.

95
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,120
so just to give you a historical frame

96
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,699
of reference a pretty famous here in

97
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,459
cannabinoid research was was 1964 where

98
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,139
Delta 9 THC was isolated and its

99
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,479
chemical structure was identified by

100
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,639
Raphael mashulum and Delta 9 was

101
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,039
recognized to be at that point the the

102
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,179
primary active or psychoactive component

103
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,519
in cannabis

104
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,800
but I want to go back even 25 years

105
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,539
earlier than this

106
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,659
oh

107
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,939
so 25 years before the the isolation

108
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:47,519
identification of Delta 9 was actually

109
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:50,000
the first synthesis of Delta 8 and

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,200
actual testing in animals and in humans

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,759
this perhaps isn't quite as well known

112
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,859
but this this gentleman that you see

113
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,359
here his name is Roger Adams he was an

114
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,500
American chemist at the University of

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,540
Illinois

116
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,719
and it's it's kind of an interesting

117
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:05,699
story so in 1939

118
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,919
the US government this this is two years

119
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,079
after the federal government the de

120
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,259
facto made cannabis illegal with the tax

121
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
act uh 1937 then in 1939 the US

122
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,039
government had actually asked this

123
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,039
chemist to isolate the intoxicating

124
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,540
compact of cannabis well we know he

125
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,460
wasn't successful in that because we

126
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,740
know that michulum did it 25 years later

127
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,959
so what's one of the reasons that he

128
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,120
wasn't successful well the US government

129
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,579
actually gave him samples of Minnesota

130
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,800
fiber hemp to work with which most

131
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,300
people know has very very little Delta I

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,340
THC

133
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,439
so he wasn't successful in actually

134
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,379
identifying this at the time but what

135
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,180
does fiber hemp have a lot more of

136
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:47,699
cannabidiol or CBD so he actually

137
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,220
published on the isolation of CBD in in

138
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,199
1940 in a partial structural

139
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,880
identification

140
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,340
so what does this have to do with Delta

141
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,079
8 well at this time Roger Adams started

142
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:00,959
playing around with the molecule making

143
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:04,139
derivatives of CBD one of the things he

144
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,839
did was he put CBD in an organic solvent

145
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,600
he added a little bit of acid and heated

146
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,918
it that's the reaction that I'm pretty

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,840
sure every chemist in this room is

148
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,740
familiar with it's how even today were

149
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,659
were converting CBD into into Delta a so

150
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,579
this reaction was first done over 80

151
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,340
years ago

152
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:25,500
and so what he discovered at that time

153
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,478
is that if when he did this reaction CBD

154
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,699
was can could be converted to two

155
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,800
different molecules and he was able to

156
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,120
partially identify these molecules and

157
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,220
and realize they were too chemically

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,600
distinct molecules that they were he was

159
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,919
able to partially identify the ring

160
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,320
structure and had an idea that these

161
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,939
were tetrahydrocannabinol molecules but

162
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,719
couldn't actually tell exactly what they

163
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,180
were

164
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
but he tested them both in animals and

165
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,840
realized that they were both

166
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,758
psychoactive and so he hypothesized that

167
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,198
perhaps one or some combination of both

168
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,120
of these molecules were what was

169
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,800
responsible for the psychoactive effects

170
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,500
of of cannabis

171
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,079
now we know today in retrospect that

172
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,699
these are Delta 8 and Delta 9 THC but at

173
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,819
the time he wasn't quite sure what he

174
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,379
was working with nonetheless he decided

175
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,978
him and his colleagues decided that it

176
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:13,139
was time to actually test this in humans

177
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:16,620
so the first clinical testing of Delta 8

178
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:19,259
was actually done prior to 1942 or it

179
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,478
was published in 1942 and so this was

180
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,520
done at welfare Island Hospital so

181
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:26,099
welfare island is now known as Roosevelt

182
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,079
Island in New York City at the time it

183
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,000
had a prison and the penitentiary

184
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,800
Hospital on the islands

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,899
and so they actually did a clinical

186
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,340
study using volunteer prisoners where

187
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,560
they administered various different

188
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,179
types of cannabinoids one was just a

189
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,899
crude cannabis extract which of course

190
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,360
has Delta 9. he also administered the

191
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:47,339
CBD Drive Delta eight and then there's

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,439
also two other cannabinoids that he

193
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,899
tested as well that I won't get into now

194
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,759
but given this was a study with with 77

195
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,918
subjects even today this is essentially

196
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,319
the largest clinical study that we have

197
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,758
had of of Delta a THC and at the time

198
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,759
they didn't even know what it was

199
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,620
so this was published in in 1942

200
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,020
actually a very interesting article that

201
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,579
basically Roger Adams subsequented to

202
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:14,099
this study decided that he wanted to do

203
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:16,258
some additional studies some additional

204
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,060
testing he sent samples of Delta a to

205
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,680
about a dozen different chemistry

206
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,598
colleagues then they wrote letters to

207
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,180
him saying hey I tested it I took it

208
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,199
with dinner this is what I felt and some

209
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,780
of those descriptions are pretty

210
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,699
entertaining so I can definitely provide

211
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,019
the reference for people to to read this

212
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,460
this article this pretty pretty

213
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,740
entertaining

214
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,418
uh but the effects of Delta a that were

215
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,699
actually observed in this study in the

216
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:41,339
prison were pretty familiar so you saw

217
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,098
elevated pulse rate dry mouth sometimes

218
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:46,500
anxiety sometimes Euphoria increased

219
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:48,478
hunger drowsiness laughter and for those

220
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,038
prisoners who had been high before or

221
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,139
used cannabis before they said this

222
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,300
feels a lot like using cannabis

223
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,598
so this was the first indication in

224
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,939
humans back in 1942 that it looks like

225
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,159
Delta 8 is acting an awful lot like

226
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:06,319
Delta 9 or like cannabis even before

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,319
they even knew what Delta 8 actually was

228
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,459
after this it was a pretty slow period

229
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:15,060
for cannabis research

230
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:16,620
after 1942 U.S centered World War II the

231
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,538
the research priorities of the US

232
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,300
government just changed Roger Adams

233
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:23,098
essentially went on to retire from

234
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,379
cannabinoid research he worked on other

235
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:28,339
things and it was just a slow 25 years

236
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:31,800
or so for a cannabinoid research until

237
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:34,019
1964 when michulum identified Delta 9

238
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,658
THC and shortly after the the structure

239
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,059
of Delta a THC was identified and now

240
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:41,278
they really had the tools to assess

241
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,439
Delta 8 versus delta 9 THC

242
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,600
quantitatively and see is there any

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,700
quantitative difference well they

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,560
started giving Delta a Delta 9 to to

245
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,060
animals to different species and they

246
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,399
could clearly see well it's overall

247
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,319
doing the same thing qualitatively we we

248
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,639
see the same effects as as cannabis

249
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,959
Delta nine

250
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,120
but when they started looking at

251
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:02,278
individual species they started to see

252
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,259
some differences so they tested these

253
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,899
are the very early animal studies in the

254
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:10,080
1960s early 1970s tended to be on

255
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,480
monkeys on dogs on rats and what they

256
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,100
saw was a pretty consistent Trend that

257
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,080
Delta eight was always a little bit

258
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,459
weaker than Delta nine so this is the

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,379
first time they had really observed this

260
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,659
so in monkeys you needed about a

261
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:24,179
four-fold high of a four-fold higher

262
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:26,819
dose of of intravenous Delta eight to

263
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:29,039
have an equivalent effect to Delta 9 in

264
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,140
dog and rat assays you needed about a

265
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,939
two-fold higher dose so it was starting

266
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,139
to look like there was a consistent

267
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,720
pattern here

268
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,399
but over time researchers started using

269
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,080
you know monkeys and these dog assays

270
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,278
less and less and started using mice

271
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,720
more

272
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,360
so they developed these uh it's called

273
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,700
tetrad essays it's a set of four assays

274
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,800
they typically do in mice and if these

275
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,360
assays have positive results in all four

276
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,639
that usually indicates it's a

277
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,039
cannabinoid Agonist so when they tested

278
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,720
Delta 8 in these in these tetrat assays

279
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,740
and mice they actually saw something a

280
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,200
little bit different from the other

281
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,379
species they saw that Delta 8 had the

282
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,759
same potency as Delta 9. so that was a

283
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,679
little bit weird they didn't really know

284
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,539
exactly or I imagine they didn't really

285
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,338
know what to make of this at the at the

286
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:13,559
time

287
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,899
um but keep in mind that at that time uh

288
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,458
they never tested Delta 8 in humans

289
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,600
except for that one very early study

290
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,159
where they didn't really know what they

291
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,200
were testing so they didn't know would

292
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,539
humans look more like mice would Delta 8

293
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,100
be the same the same potency would they

294
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:28,079
look more like monkeys and have very

295
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,659
different potency at that time they they

296
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,700
just didn't have any data to say

297
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:34,259
or at least no published data

298
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,839
so they didn't have to wait till too

299
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,679
long in 1973 they actually published

300
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,640
there's two studies published almost

301
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,679
simultaneously one from a group in the

302
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,179
U.S one from a group in Brazil

303
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,979
and between these two different

304
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,439
Publications they actually tested

305
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,139
intravenous dosing oral dosing like

306
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,000
Edibles and and smoked as well

307
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:57,360
both of these studies compared both

308
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,339
Delta 8 and Delta 9 THC at a range of

309
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,560
Doses and so I just kind of repotted the

310
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,600
data from from all these studies you see

311
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,239
on the y-axis essentially just a scale

312
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,278
of of subjectively How High people felt

313
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,959
or how strong they they felt the effects

314
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,078
were on the x-axis you see different

315
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,699
doses so overall what you see across

316
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:17,639
these different routes of admission

317
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,339
Administration is very consistently

318
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,039
across all different doses at any one

319
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,380
given dose the effects of Delta 9 are

320
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,939
almost always stronger than Delta a and

321
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,700
while of course we we kind of all know

322
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,860
that's true today at a time in 1973 this

323
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,200
was like totally new data because people

324
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,220
really didn't have didn't really have

325
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,440
any idea at that time

326
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,600
so now they knew it was different they

327
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,820
knew Delta 9 was more potent than T

328
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,440
Delta a THC but otherwise they knew it

329
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,480
was doing about the same thing but how

330
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,740
how could they explain this why is there

331
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,060
this difference

332
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,820
well they didn't really have any ability

333
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:56,159
to test this because in 1973 they didn't

334
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,740
even know how THC worked there is one

335
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,899
hypothesis that there was a receptor for

336
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,299
THC there was another hypothesis that

337
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:05,100
there was no receptor that THC molecules

338
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:06,359
were just kind of perturbing the

339
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,759
neuronal membranes in a very

340
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,800
non-specific manner so they had to wait

341
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,019
another 15 years before they even

342
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,240
identified that the actual mechanism and

343
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,919
the specific receptor for THC to

344
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,560
actually start looking at the mechanisms

345
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,699
of why Delta a and Y Delta 9 are are

346
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,578
different

347
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,620
uh so it was 1988 they first identified

348
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:28,919
in the red brain the this cannabinoid

349
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,778
CB1 receptor and then shortly thereafter

350
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,000
they closed the receptor meaning they

351
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:34,980
identified the actual DNA sequence they

352
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,419
could put that DNA sequence into cells

353
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,379
and cause the cells to produce the

354
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:42,539
receptor in order to to study it better

355
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,338
so now 15 years after the first clinical

356
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:46,319
data they finally have this ability to

357
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,360
actually see okay at the cannabinoid

358
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,920
receptor what is there is there any

359
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,800
difference at the level of the receptor

360
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,958
of what Delta a is doing and it turns

361
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,000
out that every species has a slightly

362
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,399
different version of the CB1 receptor

363
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,440
the human CB1 receptor isn't equal to

364
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,120
the the mouse CB1 receptor has a

365
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,620
different DNA sequence it functions

366
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,778
slightly differently

367
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,240
so they actually did these Delta 8

368
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,039
versus delta 9 tests in using

369
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,600
cannabinoid receptors from all different

370
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,599
species so for example

371
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,379
Rats first they they did the rat

372
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,899
receptor well as I said earlier in Vivo

373
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,639
and whole rats they saw about a two-fold

374
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,740
potency difference and sure enough

375
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,500
looking in vitro effects of Delta eight

376
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,539
and Delta 9 at the at the rat CB1

377
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,278
receptor it looked like Delta 8 had

378
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,559
about two to three fold less affinity

379
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,480
for the CB1 receptor about a two to

380
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,159
three fold difference in the the potency

381
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,500
and its ability to activate the

382
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,899
receptors so this seemed to make some

383
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,519
sense that this is going to explain this

384
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,278
difference in affinity for the receptor

385
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,440
is going to explain why CB or sorry why

386
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,078
Delta 8 has a different effect in Vivo

387
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,360
and rats well they repeated this in in

388
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,819
mice and remember mice seemed to be a

389
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,620
little bit of an outlier that in Vivo

390
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,079
and mice Delta 8 had about the same

391
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,639
potency as Delta nine I mean on average

392
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:04,439
there's probably over a dozen different

393
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,759
studies where they tested it in mice and

394
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,160
there's a range of results but on

395
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,600
average it was about the same potency

396
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,759
and so sure enough when they looked in

397
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,800
vitro at the mouse version of the CB1

398
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,139
receptor they saw that Delta 8 had about

399
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:18,539
the same Affinity the same a potency as

400
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,278
as Delta nine so it seemed like this

401
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,019
difference that the receptor was really

402
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,838
what was driving the difference in whole

403
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,360
animals so that seemed to make sense

404
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,220
but then the next piece of data came out

405
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,778
a little bit I would say unexpected

406
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,879
which was the human version of the

407
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:35,100
cannabinoid CB1 receptor so we know in

408
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,200
humans everybody has their own idea of

409
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,060
what the difference in potency is but uh

410
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,920
let's say on average give or take about

411
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:42,239
two folds

412
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,159
And yet when they looked at the human

413
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,500
CB1 receptor they actually saw a

414
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,958
six-fold difference in potency so Delta

415
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,240
eight had six-fold less Affinity than

416
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,039
Delta nine well that's kind of weird

417
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,100
because we don't see a six-fold decrease

418
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,740
in potency in in humans so I think this

419
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,959
is something that's not 100 on not 100

420
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,519
understood exactly why there's this

421
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,500
contradiction between what we see at the

422
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,360
human receptor and what we see in Vivo

423
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,919
You could argue well it's different

424
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,899
experimental conditions because

425
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,399
different Labs have these different uh

426
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,899
conditions in which they run these

427
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,639
assays and perhaps it's just not a very

428
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,039
accurate result but three different

429
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,079
independent Laboratories have published

430
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,120
the the six-fold difference give or take

431
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,979
between Delta a and Delta 9 at the CB1

432
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,959
receptor so there could be some other

433
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,399
mechanism going on here that we just

434
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,399
don't understand yet

435
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,360
so finally to to finish up I want to

436
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,399
talk more globally about potentially

437
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,980
other differences in the effects of

438
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,480
Delta 8 versus delta 9. well one

439
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,579
possibility may be kind of an

440
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,159
uninteresting possibility Delta eight

441
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:46,259
does the exact same thing as Delta 9

442
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,719
it's just a little bit weaker

443
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:50,458
it's possible uh clearly there's a lot

444
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,199
of overlap but is it doing the exact

445
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,838
same thing maybe

446
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,338
another more interesting possibility is

447
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,800
that it actually has distinct

448
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,920
pharmacological effects that actually

449
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,899
differentiate it from from Delta 9. so

450
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,458
one example of this that at this point I

451
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,720
would say it's just a hypothesis we

452
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,759
don't know for sure it hasn't been

453
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,519
tested in clinical studies but some

454
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,159
people report that Delta 8 produces less

455
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,139
anxiety than Delta 9 at a dose that

456
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,458
otherwise gives equivalent overall

457
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,259
effects

458
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,819
so that's one possibility and there

459
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,578
could be other differences in subjective

460
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,899
effects or therapeutic effects and we

461
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:27,419
just don't know yet there's just not

462
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:30,179
enough research there is currently one

463
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,219
or two ongoing clinical studies which is

464
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,919
good to see but overall we have very

465
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,740
little data to actually see if there is

466
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,120
perhaps a case where Delta 8 could have

467
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,860
a different therapeutic effect than

468
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Delta 9. so hopefully we'll see some

469
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,220
more research

470
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,959
but is this even something that's likely

471
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,000
or is there a mechanism that could

472
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,159
explain why Delta 8 might be different

473
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,759
than Delta nine well I think there is

474
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,620
mechanistically a possibility for this

475
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,120
an example of this this potential

476
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,578
mechanism of how Delta a could be

477
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,100
different is at the CB2 receptor so I

478
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:05,159
already told you Delta 8 is weaker at

479
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,919
the CB1 receptor than Delta 9 but Delta

480
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,558
8 has the same potency as Delta 9 at the

481
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,199
CB2 receptor

482
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,879
so let's just imagine a hypothetical

483
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,100
scenario this is really just me all

484
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,500
hypothesizing well the CB2 receptor

485
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,678
tends it's it's expressed very heavily

486
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,939
in in immune cells it potentially has an

487
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,220
anti-inflammatory effect a very

488
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,839
different effect from the cv1 receptor

489
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,940
so let's imagine this hypothetical

490
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:33,480
scenario which is which is just based on

491
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,259
in vitro binding data so on the left

492
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,779
um

493
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:39,779
you have Delta 9 and according to this

494
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:42,359
data of this particular publication 18

495
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:46,019
nanomolars of Delta 9 that concentration

496
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,819
will produce about 50 percent binding of

497
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,980
the CB1 receptor which means out of all

498
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,418
the CB1 receptor half of it is bound to

499
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,480
Delta 9.

500
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:57,538
well CB2 receptor binding Affinity is

501
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,679
about the same as CB1 for for Delta nine

502
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:00,359
and so maybe according to this

503
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,700
publication a little bit weaker so where

504
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:07,139
you have 50 occupancy at Delta one you

505
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,880
have about 30 occupancy it at CB2

506
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,500
well now let's consider the situation of

507
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,780
Delta eight what's one thing we know

508
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,940
people will hydrate the dose to the

509
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:16,558
effect we they want so if they want to

510
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,940
feel a particular effect of Delta a

511
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,759
they're just going to take a little bit

512
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,558
more of it compared to to Delta 9. so

513
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,779
let's assume the person takes a slightly

514
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,700
higher dose of Delta 8 to compensate for

515
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:29,160
this slightly weaker effect and and

516
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,220
still they end up with 50 receptor

517
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,080
occupation at the CB1 receptor

518
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,298
well because now they're into a higher

519
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,579
dose range and because the CB2 Affinity

520
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,079
is the same as Delta 9 they would

521
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:44,639
actually end up with something more like

522
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:46,859
85 percent occupancy of the CB2 receptor

523
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,360
so if you're kind of lost with what is

524
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,038
all this receptor occupancy data mean

525
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,859
let me just put it in the the more

526
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:55,259
simple clinical terms at doses which

527
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:57,719
give equivalent psychoactive effects

528
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,099
Delta 8 could have at least

529
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,960
theoretically a greater

530
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:03,418
anti-inflammatory effect compared to

531
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,160
Delta 9. this is just kind of my

532
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,900
hypothesis this has not been you know

533
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,519
clinically proven nobody's directly

534
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,740
studied this yet but I just want to

535
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,379
provide this as one a kind of

536
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,940
hypothetical example of how Delta 8 may

537
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,220
have different therapeutic properties

538
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,440
compared to Delta 9. obviously there's

539
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,660
going to be a lot of overlap between the

540
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,400
two but perhaps there's cases where one

541
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,960
could be more appropriate appropriate

542
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,780
for one patient and another more

543
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,640
appropriate for a different patient

544
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:31,678
so I'll end there thank you for

545
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,299
listening we did publish this paper on

546
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,860
Delta 8 in in British Journal of

547
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,599
pharmacology last year so if you want to

548
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:39,359
learn more about Delta 8 you can you can

549
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,939
read that it's open access otherwise I'm

550
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,439
happy to take any questions now if

551
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,679
there's time or or later you can always

552
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,679
just send me an email thank you

553
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,679
foreign

554
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,500
thank you I look forward to reviewing

555
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,719
your paper I question any idea of the

556
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,460
differences between Delta 8 and Delta 9

557
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,160
at other clinically relevant targets

558
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,279
like the P powers or the trip channels

559
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,600
they have to the best of my knowledge

560
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,740
and you know this was a year ago we

561
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:09,359
reviewed the literature pretty

562
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,819
comprehensively so unless it's something

563
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,538
very new they haven't assayed at any

564
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:17,279
other targets besides cv1 and CB2 got it

565
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:19,740
thank you

566
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,819
uh okay so I'm getting kicked off stage

567
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,819
so thank you for listening
