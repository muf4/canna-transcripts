on the podcast

thanks Ben thanks for having me happy

121
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,638
Monday

122
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,280
happy Monday indeed all right I'm

123
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,560
excited to talk with you today about

124
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:13,079
investment in cannabis Innovations now

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,019
we've talked with many researchers and

126
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,120
innovators over the years on the podcast

127
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:19,918
and seeing them at can Med uh really

128
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,280
working on moving the industry forward

129
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,258
through new discoveries and new

130
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,719
Innovations so

131
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,280
however they need capital and investment

132
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,960
to bring those discoveries and

133
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,478
Technologies to life and that's where

134
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:37,319
firms like you in at Golden Eagle

135
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,000
Partners can help so I was hoping could

136
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,800
you tell us a bit about the cannabis

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,379
companies that you guys are working with

138
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,780
and what you help them do

139
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,819
yeah thanks Ben so first of all the

140
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,099
thing to start off with maybe before we

141
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,860
talk about Golden Eagle Partners in

142
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,600
specific is really what is the

143
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,220
definition of cannabis because I think

144
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,199
you know this industry is so crazy and

145
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,460
part of that craziness results from the

146
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,580
fact that everybody's got their own

147
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,258
nomenclature our perspective is you know

148
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:08,099
it's derived from the fact that cannabis

149
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:10,319
is the genus of this wonderful plant and

150
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,780
so when we consider cannabis we don't

151
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,339
we're not just talking marijuana or THC

152
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,119
plus preparations whatever you want to

153
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:19,739
call it uh we believe cannabis is is

154
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
all-encompassing of things stemming from

155
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,720
the plant whether it's THC plus what we

156
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,060
call THC Plus or marijuana preparations

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,979
THC minus which then we break it down

158
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,100
into industrial hemp and then what we

159
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:35,699
call molecular hemp like CBD CBG

160
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:39,060
you know CBN all that stuff uh we have

161
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:41,939
been uh so Golding A Partners the firm

162
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,038
uh we started jumping in we jumped into

163
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:46,319
canvas in 2013 and frankly Ben we've

164
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,000
been very lucky about what we've been

165
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,919
doing and where we're at now because I

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,079
could have never predicted when I was

167
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,299
getting my undergrad degrees of biochem

168
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,538
and molecular bio at CU Boulder in the

169
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,639
80s that I'd be doing this uh but it's

170
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:01,318
it's awesome we ended up I ended up

171
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,180
jumping into biotech companies

172
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,360
operational roles for 15 years and

173
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,918
companies in Boulder Berlin Germany

174
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,020
Silicon Valley and did all the way

175
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,159
through project management into business

176
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,799
development

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,939
and also lucky enough to invent it on

178
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,620
three patents two of those are

179
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:18,478
bioprocessing and everybody knows

180
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,280
bioprocessing is a big part of this

181
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,839
industry whether you're calling it THC

182
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,899
plus minus whatever

183
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,899
I got into Investment Banking or jumped

184
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:29,519
into Investment Banking 2005 in San

185
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,899
Francisco doing biotech deals and came

186
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,198
back to Colorado where I'm originally

187
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,519
from in 2009 and then 12. found a

188
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,500
Golding of Partners and everybody know

189
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:41,098
that's when Washington Colorado kicked

190
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,199
things off with adult use so in 2013 we

191
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:45,779
started advising companies in 2014 I was

192
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,919
advising a company called Cerna uh they

193
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,138
were one of the first three public

194
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,579
companies in the space and so has jumped

195
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,978
into full-time as their Chief business

196
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,779
officer and did that for about a year

197
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:56,639
and through that experience Ben realized

198
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,219
that it was it's not easy to find good

199
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,780
capital for good cannabis companies uh

200
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,599
and it wasn't easy then and it's not

201
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,818
easy now unfortunately uh but after

202
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,038
leaving soon we actually I reactivated

203
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,259
my registrations with finra so both Matt

204
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:13,199
Dougherty and I Matt's works with me

205
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:16,259
over here at GP uh are both registered

206
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,379
uh with finra so we've helped we've done

207
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,720
25 deals in the Cannabis space we help

208
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,340
Pharma can raise twice 30 million in

209
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,080
2018.

210
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,719
and we also helped a company called

211
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,818
Panacea leading hemp processor raise uh

212
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,700
do a 14 million dollar upfront strategic

213
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:36,000
uh deal in 2019 and we've talked around

214
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,620
the U.S from San Francisco San Diego The

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,259
Hamptons Miami

216
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,060
Denver but also internationally we've

217
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,399
talked on cannabis and Toronto twice

218
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,399
Grand Cayman Frankford twice Dubai in

219
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,139
2018 Davos in 2020 during the world

220
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,480
economic forum and then we sponsored

221
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,699
event and Berlin

222
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,320
uh just a month and month and a half ago

223
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,480
so that was very cool and then we had

224
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,399
our first Israeli client in 2016 so

225
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,980
we've been doing International been for

226
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,899
over six years and then also lucky

227
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,459
enough as I mentioned we've just been

228
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,899
lucky with my whole life about where

229
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,719
we're at because I also play pro

230
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,539
lacrosse back in the late 80s with the

231
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,120
field first field lacrosse league and uh

232
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:18,480
so then I joined athletes for care about

233
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,100
five six years ago and so I'm an athlete

234
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,300
Ambassador for them and then they asked

235
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,740
me a year and a half ago to be the

236
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,379
chairman of their scientific advisory

237
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,060
Council so we've done that and so I work

238
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,980
put together a group with some of the

239
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:32,639
leading lights in the industry like

240
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,278
Ethan Rousseau uh Deb kimless Guillermo

241
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,278
Moreno Sans from Spain and Raquel piruba

242
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,838
from Uruguay so so we kind of pull this

243
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:43,559
whole thing together as a long-winded

244
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,260
explanation but to your point too uh the

245
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,119
the one thing that's interesting Ben is

246
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,319
that if you really understand and been

247
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,620
in biotech

248
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,959
and now where cannabis is going you know

249
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,700
it's going more towards molecules all

250
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,219
the time Delta whether you hate it or

251
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,320
like that molecule

252
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,000
that's kind of an indication that this

253
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,920
industry is going more towards molecules

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,480
I believe in the Entourage effect but I

255
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,458
think we're going to need to deconvolute

256
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,259
a lot of these things which gets to your

257
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,479
question you know on innovation

258
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,458
and one of the last company biotech

259
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,560
company I worked at we were one of the

260
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:19,079
leading systems biology companies and we

261
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,879
couldn't do a 20 million dollar series B

262
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,639
so we had to do an inside round of 6

263
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,139
million I lost my job and so did 30 of

264
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,019
the people in the company because of

265
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,819
that so I understand full well from that

266
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,259
experience Ben that I don't care how

267
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,700
good your technology is and how many

268
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,620
patents you have if you don't have money

269
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,800
you don't have money and to add to that

270
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,899
Innovation is extremely expensive r d

271
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,879
takes money and you got to sink money in

272
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,220
for hoping something comes down the line

273
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,720
and just add to that from my experience

274
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,639
being an inventor on three pounds just

275
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,839
because you have a pad most patents

276
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,360
don't monetize

277
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,220
so you know what are our we have a

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,500
unique skill set as I mentioned to talk

279
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,440
to companies around the world

280
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,778
whether they're in THC plus THC minus

281
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,060
there most of the companies they're

282
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:05,519
really going to get above the noise

283
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,018
whether it's here internationally have

284
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,179
to innovate they need competitive

285
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,820
advantage and a good way to get that

286
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,519
right is IP intellectual property pads

287
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,720
et cetera trademarks uh and so that's

288
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,480
one of the things we're doing right now

289
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,700
uh it's a very tough funding environment

290
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,079
uh but I think the smart money is

291
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,320
looking to the Future and part of that

292
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,819
future is innovation right is that

293
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,459
absolutely absolutely answer your

294
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,079
question it certainly does and it's a

295
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,899
good segue because I mean that's what

296
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,219
kmed's all about is bringing together

297
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,360
innovators and so that's why we're

298
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,540
really happy to have Golden Eagle

299
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,220
Partners be part of kmed 23 because

300
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:44,338
you're leading a pre-conference workshop

301
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,079
on Capital markets to help these folks

302
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,940
so what are you planning to cover in

303
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,338
that workshop and why should attendees

304
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,100
make sure they don't miss it yeah so a

305
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,740
great question and you know the one

306
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,600
thing that I think a good justification

307
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,759
to talk about while we jumped into doing

308
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,899
this is you know we've been sponsoring

309
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,458
and we looked at we just had a

310
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:05,639
discussion this morning we've sponsored

311
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:06,778
over 30 events uh and frankly we just

312
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,720
sent an email to somebody we don't

313
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:12,720
attend events unless we sponsor and we

314
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,220
participate and I'm on a panel frankly

315
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,500
um and just because we want to continue

316
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,300
to be a kol and when cam it came up we

317
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,879
talked to Brendan and I was one of the

318
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:22,679
first uh Finance people to talk at can

319
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,659
Med we did that last year and then

320
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,338
Brendan said hey when we're at Canada

321
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:27,539
this year we're looking to do a capital

322
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,459
markets

323
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:32,278
and you know we have a pretty

324
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:35,159
significant Advantage uh in what we do

325
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,600
and frankly because this came out of uh

326
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,240
talking to Brendan and other people I

327
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,120
know you talked to other transactional

328
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,419
groups or investment Banks they have a

329
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,120
cannabis group and they have uh a

330
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:51,059
biotech group but they don't have a

331
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,919
group that combines both like we do so

332
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,259
our whole idea was you know if we're

333
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,179
really going to be the real deal and not

334
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,278
lose this Advantage we have we need to

335
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,979
be the lead sponsor at kmet so we jumped

336
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,778
into that and I think what we want to do

337
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,339
with can Madden a matter of fact you

338
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:07,439
know I think we're on the same page with

339
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,600
medicinal genomics team on this I think

340
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,339
it's going to be a great event we're

341
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,320
part of the thing we want to pattern

342
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,000
after is red herring which many of the

343
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,000
people in the tech in the biotech space

344
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,799
the Old Guard understand red herring was

345
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,220
a magazine uh in the 80s and 90s that

346
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,838
really took root in all the tech uh

347
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,660
Innovation that went on in Silicon

348
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,579
Valley and around the world at that time

349
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:34,439
and was red herring was a very cool

350
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:37,138
amalgamation of really a lot of

351
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,880
cutting-edge Technologies Finance you

352
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,759
know how because again you know all this

353
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:45,059
Innovation is expensive and so we want

354
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,039
canvad to be essentially something like

355
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,599
that where it's it's definitely going to

356
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,719
be talking about Capital markets about

357
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,620
Capital fund funding transactional

358
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,700
options

359
00:13:52,620 --> 00:14:02,159
definitely but it's also going to

360
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:04,800
talk to uh to the extent on What new

361
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,539
technologies are coming down the pipe

362
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,120
what technologies are currently in

363
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:11,699
cannabis and then you know are you

364
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,320
talking ancillary to cannabis or deep

365
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,680
into cannabis where you'd like to talk

366
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,420
about Innovation intellectual property

367
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,799
because that's also going to be a very

368
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,439
interesting thing over time that it

369
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,559
evolves and certainly when I have the

370
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,079
international component to it to see you

371
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,819
know what companies are doing what

372
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,278
things in the space and as you know too

373
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,959
Ben this this industry is quickly you

374
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:36,480
know blowing up into different little

375
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,859
sectors and sub-sectors and so we want

376
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,899
to make sure that we're covering you

377
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,480
know the technology side the the

378
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,240
management side a lot of the operational

379
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,519
side but it is really going to relate to

380
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,198
where we're at now with Technology

381
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,198
Innovation and then where is it going to

382
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,299
be in the next year year and a half

383
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,819
great and I guess that's a good question

384
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:59,278
to ask then so what what technologies

385
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,079
and news do you think we're gonna see

386
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,059
maybe where what do you think we're

387
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,439
going to see before can Med in May is

388
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,759
there anything in particular you think

389
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,760
will be coming out

390
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,958
uh

391
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,198
that's a good question

392
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,259
uh well I think one of the things

393
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,120
uh we're well one of the things that I

394
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,240
mentioned in Frankfurt Ben is our

395
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,799
thought is uh you you know we don't

396
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,639
believe there's really a crystal ball

397
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:29,338
for cannabis and uh and we talked to a

398
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,019
well-known lawyer in the space in uh

399
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,639
Berlin and he had a different

400
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,440
perspective that he believes there is

401
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,139
and I think though and I agree with him

402
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,940
to some extent that you can appreciate

403
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,459
and kind of predict maybe where certain

404
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,320
geographies are going to have like

405
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,879
States or countries how it's going to

406
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,740
evolve over time starting with medical

407
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,740
and then going to adult use but I think

408
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,419
being a being an advisor and looking at

409
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,278
companies trying to tell what's coming

410
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:54,240
down the road in different things

411
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,179
especially when you're talking about

412
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,060
technology is next to Impossible but you

413
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:01,739
know our expectation uh fortunately or

414
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,419
unfortunately the FDA is probably going

415
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,480
to come out with some type of guidance

416
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:11,578
uh whether it's on cannabinoids cannabis

417
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,139
CBD uh between now and next May uh don't

418
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:14,638
know if it's going to be good or bad for

419
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,820
the industry and maybe I'm completely

420
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,220
wrong maybe we don't have that but we

421
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,940
think definitely to my earlier point

422
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:27,240
that the molecular sides going to

423
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,980
continue to be important again we

424
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,720
believe in the Entourage effect and a

425
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,039
lot of times one plus one plus one

426
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,199
equals five

427
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:39,778
but also you know for example uh the the

428
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,758
Delta H side and then you know obviously

429
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:43,458
CBG and the number of things coming to

430
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,860
the four we talked to a company

431
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:48,659
in Boston last week at icdp that has a

432
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,539
really interesting THC analog that's

433
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,819
doing as some really uh interesting data

434
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:56,578
but more importantly too I think we need

435
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,920
to really explore The Human Side there's

436
00:16:56,578 --> 00:17:02,159
been a lot of time and effort been put

437
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:04,019
into the plant genetics and you know how

438
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,519
really if you look at a Keim of our

439
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:08,279
strain or whatever you want to call it

440
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,838
we call them king of Mars if it if

441
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,058
somebody says it's one thing a lot of

442
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,458
times it's not it's another thing but

443
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:16,740
the side that really has not had a lot

444
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,480
of effort put into it is the The Human

445
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,279
Side the human genetics because each

446
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,519
person does

447
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,480
act differently with a lot of these

448
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:26,818
different compounds in the

449
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,160
endocannabinoid system itself is is a

450
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:30,839
unique uh system and there's a company

451
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,820
called endocana Health that's doing some

452
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,159
very interesting things that we worked

453
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:37,259
with in the past on looking at persons

454
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,519
genetic background and makeup and we

455
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,220
think that that's going to continue to

456
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:43,500
be a big part of the cannabinoid the

457
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,798
Cannabis sector in the next you know six

458
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,558
to 12 months

459
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:53,160
yeah absolutely that whole that whole

460
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:54,660
um phenomena of cannabis affecting

461
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,860
people differently the same products

462
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,419
differently I was actually at a family

463
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:59,759
party this weekend we were having a

464
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,580
conversation about that very thing so

465
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,079
it's very real right well and that's the

466
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:07,019
other thing too is you know Ben the cool

467
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:12,298
thing that what we're trying to do at GP

468
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:14,038
Colonial Partners is to to provide money

469
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:16,558
to companies that are going to generate

470
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,900
the data to move this industry forward

471
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,819
because everybody knows you know I know

472
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,798
everybody that's listening to this knows

473
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:24,418
somebody or themselves where they've

474
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,538
given a prep certain preparation of

475
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:29,940
somebody and like oh my God you know

476
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,558
there's a woman I work to got to know at

477
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,000
the local bank who's taking Ambien and

478
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:34,259
NyQuil every night couldn't sleep and

479
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,179
went through a number of different

480
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:38,099
things with her and gave her Delta eight

481
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,140
and guess what she said it changed her

482
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,579
life how cool is that right

483
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,880
so yeah

484
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,319
yeah absolutely yeah you need the

485
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
funding to do the research and

486
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,879
especially if you're sort of waiting in

487
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,200
the waters with these massive

488
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,440
pharmaceutical companies who just have

489
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,720
boatloads of cash to to innovate and to

490
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,220
you know generate data

491
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,620
um you know we need to keep up somehow

492
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,779
yeah well and also one thing real quick

493
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:05,819
uh Ben that that kind of gets to the

494
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:09,298
point of and I mentioned this with

495
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:11,339
Brendan mckernan uh from your firm last

496
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:13,619
week on what is the target audience for

497
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:15,418
cammet and I think what we can if we do

498
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,000
it right I think we ought to be getting

499
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,740
pretty much a whole Spectrum hopefully

500
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,779
people that have used some of these

501
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,179
preparations and have found an amazing

502
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:26,519
result from it hopefully you know

503
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,259
leading uh Finance people and then you

504
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,940
have operational people in companies

505
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:31,440
whether plant touching or non-plant

506
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,380
touching whether it's science-based or

507
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,380
non-science based and then other people

508
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,980
ancillary you know uh to that whether

509
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:43,559
it's uh IP lawyers or or accountants

510
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,679
what have you I think the the topics

511
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,538
that we're going to cover uh our goal uh

512
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,580
whenever we do something like this or

513
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:54,179
sit down in front of people

514
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:55,740
Ben is hopefully the goal is that people

515
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,679
walk out of the room and don't say that

516
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,380
was a waste of time and I firmly believe

517
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:03,900
that can Med is is going to be a really

518
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,919
it's the first of its kind I believe if

519
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,840
we do it right it's going to be the

520
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,220
first of its kind in cannabis in the

521
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,159
world

522
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,679
absolutely absolutely so

523
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,660
going back to the investor side so what

524
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,820
sort of Technologies are investors

525
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,798
interested in and in general what sort

526
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:21,779
of like the climate for investment in

527
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:25,160
the Cannabis sector right now

528
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,160
uh there isn't a climate

529
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,960
you know uh yeah it's very tough I was

530
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,120
just uh talking to uh

531
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,419
somebody today that you know the only

532
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,359
other climate funding and climate be a

533
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:42,600
funding climate that I've seen similar

534
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:46,199
uh to this since I've been you know

535
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,819
doing transactions for 15 to 20 years

536
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,519
whether it's business development or

537
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:51,899
Investment Banking what have you is 2008

538
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,740
2009

539
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,600
but obviously cannabis there were you

540
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,019
know obviously cannabis operators Etc

541
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,519
doing things THC plus THC minus but yeah

542
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,819
I mean it really got going as we

543
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:09,779
mentioned in in 2012 and then you know

544
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:13,319
the first real uh legal sales of wreck

545
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:15,899
in Colorado were January 1 2014. so that

546
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,418
was six years before that so this yeah

547
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,880
it's the worst funding environment uh

548
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:23,038
that we've ever seen for cannabis

549
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,440
companies and I think people would uh

550
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,720
listening to this would agree uh with

551
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,880
that being said there is there is

552
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,659
capital out there uh you have to be

553
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,600
creative uh persistent persevere

554
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,700
um and look to different sources of

555
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,899
capital and also you have to be uh smart

556
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,179
about you know not putting your

557
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,380
valuation out there and and kind of

558
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,120
going to the market with various

559
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,679
different structures that you created on

560
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,599
that side

561
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,400
um so I think that's kind of what we

562
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,439
typically tell a lot of clients and

563
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,538
people that are we're trying to adapt

564
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,538
about being our clients

565
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:59,460
yeah it's very tough but I think

566
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:01,558
there's money out there and also I think

567
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,460
you're going to continue to have

568
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:08,519
new groups uh that are on the outside

569
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,279
looking in right or new companies new

570
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,759
firms uh for example this week I'm

571
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,500
reaching out to a lot of the biotech

572
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,759
VCS Etc that I've known for the last few

573
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,619
years and we finally have a few

574
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,400
companies that I think would pique their

575
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:24,239
interest

576
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,759
and so you know it's it's always a phone

577
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,259
call away so I I think it's a tough

578
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:29,819
environment but I think if you're out

579
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:32,099
there looking for money

580
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,418
uh it's there to be had you just have to

581
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:36,658
be smart about how much you want to

582
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:39,538
raise and how you go about it

583
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:41,760
oh is the tough climate is it mainly

584
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:43,500
just the state of the economy or is it a

585
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,200
souring on the Cannabis industry in

586
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,140
general

587
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,279
uh well I have to be careful with this

588
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,480
because I don't want to piss too many

589
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:56,038
people off but I think uh it's it's a

590
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,798
it's well it's a lot of different

591
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:59,940
factors personally I mean having been in

592
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,400
it so long

593
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,038
uh I mean part of the fact that frankly

594
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,880
the the the industry is kind of a

595
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,519
show

596
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,220
uh or sorry dumpster fire you can edit

597
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:14,058
out or put in whatever you want but the

598
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,380
idea is that you have for example 280e

599
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:18,720
uh which is very tough and other

600
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,760
Industries don't deal with that so that

601
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,500
puts pressure on margins

602
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,240
frankly you have a lot of people that

603
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,220
jumped into this early that thought it

604
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,960
was easy to grow weed and it is easier

605
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,720
to grow weed but it's really really hard

606
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,600
to grow really good cannabis right

607
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,880
so that's a problem you have all these

608
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,740
different regulatory requirements you

609
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,200
have the fact that there's a patchwork

610
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,240
across states where if you want to go

611
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,400
into different states you have to build

612
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,980
the same essentially functionality which

613
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,080
costs money which essentially leads to

614
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,940
diseconomies of scale most Industries

615
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,819
have economies at scale when they build

616
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,820
bigger and better and brighter that

617
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:58,980
doesn't happen in cannabis

618
00:23:55,819 --> 00:24:02,158
uh you know just a whole and you know

619
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,519
frankly another part of it I think Ben

620
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,980
is the fact that you have money not all

621
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,960
money in this industry is smart money

622
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,120
I mean there's a lot of people and and

623
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,319
that were investing a lot of these

624
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,259
public companies

625
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,119
and the Assumption was okay well Biden's

626
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:20,579
in the White House you know pot's going

627
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,139
to be legalized in the U.S and then all

628
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:23,579
of a sudden it's going to be hunky dory

629
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,140
and when that didn't happen last year

630
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:27,178
all of a sudden the bloom is off the

631
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,320
roads and people have ran screaming for

632
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:33,019
the exits

633
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:37,200
right uh which is uh which in itself is

634
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:39,240
excuse me is a it's a problem but I

635
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,419
think over time that's that's going to

636
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,400
change but I think to me uh well the

637
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,559
other thing to add to that is the

638
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,759
legalization question that I think you

639
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:52,558
you know we talked about covering

640
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:55,200
one of the main key things we would like

641
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,178
to talk about is you know and my both my

642
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,700
parents were politicians I would never

643
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,798
advise a company to find their strategy

644
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,200
around what politicians may or may not

645
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:06,359
do uh and that comes from a

646
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,960
well-educated background in in Silicon

647
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:12,000
Valley right so that being said I think

648
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,419
what companies were telling companies is

649
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,279
just keep operating and surviving uh

650
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,220
through this but with regards to the

651
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,538
legalization question two we uh we don't

652
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,759
think it's going to happen in the next

653
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:25,679
two years uh maybe something like safe

654
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,839
or something comes through and

655
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,240
but you know again it gets back to the

656
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,819
2018 farm bill you know that passed in

657
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,798
December 2018 and then December 2019 one

658
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:38,339
of our clients was shipping hemp from

659
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,798
Oklahoma to to Colorado and the truck

660
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:42,959
ran a stop light in Oklahoma and got

661
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,179
pulled over and then all of a sudden the

662
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,679
the police in Oklahoma thought it was

663
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,600
you know the biggest drug bust in State

664
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,340
history and thought it was marijuana or

665
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:53,819
th whatever you want to call it right

666
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:55,079
and not out uh so the main point is you

667
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,538
know they didn't get the memo and I

668
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:59,460
think the same thing is going to happen

669
00:25:56,538 --> 00:26:02,339
when they try to legalize it here in the

670
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,200
U.S I mean cannabis is such a unique

671
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:08,819
industry that crosses so many federal

672
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:12,419
agencies deafda IRS fed you know shall I

673
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:15,000
go on right and so to try to address all

674
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,620
those complexities and do it right in a

675
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,960
piece alleged one or two pieces of

676
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,719
legislations I'm pretty much sure that

677
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,640
they're going to screw it up so

678
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,140
everybody thinks if legalization

679
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,640
happened it's going to be a nice black

680
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,038
and white all of a sudden everything's

681
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,679
hunky-dory and frankly I think that's a

682
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,859
pipe dream so

683
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,240
yeah sorry to be such a downer but uh

684
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,158
yeah I think the people that are going

685
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,019
to be surviving in this industry the

686
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,480
ones that are perseverance and really

687
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,220
stick to it are going to make money in

688
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,380
the end but it's it's you know it's not

689
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,440
going to be easy for sure

690
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,659
yeah no agreed there and all right so we

691
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,880
we sort of discussed the challenges in

692
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:56,100
the U.S and you know it is the largest

693
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,380
cannabis Market by far but what about

694
00:26:56,099 --> 00:27:00,359
International markets um which one of

695
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,400
those are you which of those are you

696
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:07,379
paying attention to

697
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:10,320
uh all of them no uh well we uh

698
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,700
one thing that it's frankly helped us uh

699
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,500
over the last two years with the

700
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,659
pandemic frankly the pandemics really

701
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,119
helped us been and and I appreciate the

702
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,559
fact that it hasn't helped everybody and

703
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,178
as a matter of fact I have two daughters

704
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,099
and it's been very tough on them so

705
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,900
definitely I my thoughts are out to

706
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,298
people that have not had such an easy

707
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,640
time in the pandemic for us it's been a

708
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:31,200
benefit on the fact that you know we

709
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,240
were doing International as mentioned

710
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,740
we're in Davos in January 2020 right

711
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,839
before the pandemic shut things down

712
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,700
we're the only cannabis Investment Bank

713
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,480
there can a quarter was there year

714
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,460
before and didn't make it in 2020 and so

715
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,740
we weren't able to travel last couple

716
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,259
years but we had Zoom so we had the

717
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,058
excuse to said hey guys you know we

718
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,579
can't make it to Dallas like we did or

719
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:55,319
Dubai but let's jump on the zoom call so

720
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:57,538
you know in the last 12 months or so

721
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,839
we've talked to operators in Mongolia

722
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:04,379
and Macedonia Lesotho South Africa

723
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:07,980
Colombia Peru Brazil Australia Thailand

724
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:12,960
Greece Cyprus I mean Canary Islands we

725
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:14,700
could go on so uh we are one we believe

726
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,700
we're certainly a global leader in

727
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,019
cannabis Finance

728
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,700
and so we're interested in a lot of

729
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:22,500
different markets you know I think South

730
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,798
America is very interesting

731
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,599
uh certainly Europe is uh the one thing

732
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:29,220
though that I did mention in Davos that

733
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,418
I think most people that are in the know

734
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,740
in this industry have been around the

735
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:36,299
block and will uh full fully agree that

736
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,798
pretty much most geographies when you

737
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,900
roll them out whether it's a new market

738
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,220
or whatever it's going to take more time

739
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,500
than you expect

740
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,179
uh you know you look in the U.S same

741
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,819
thing here New York it's going to take

742
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,919
longer pretty sure that Florida did

743
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:52,200
Massachusetts did Nevada did and

744
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,240
Colorado didn't Illinois still use

745
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,740
really didn't but California has taken

746
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,919
some time to roll out

747
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,558
uh uh and then you look at Europe I mean

748
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,538
Spain is taking forever UK has been on

749
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:06,000
Slow Burn forever France

750
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:07,619
Germany's you know making some noise so

751
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,720
certainly that's one reason why I went

752
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:11,099
to Frankfurt Berlin this summer Germany

753
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,620
We Believe

754
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:15,480
certainly could be the legal or the the

755
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,339
real

756
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,440
um linchpin or a lot of people are

757
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:21,418
saying how Germany goes is how Europe is

758
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,460
going to go but again back to that

759
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,020
original point I mean the scuttlebutt in

760
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,819
Germany is that they're probably looking

761
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:30,898
at adult use and

762
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:32,339
early uh late 2023 or early 2024 but

763
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:33,658
most likely is the points I just

764
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,439
mentioned is probably going to be past

765
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,539
that

766
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,278
you just for some reason you know

767
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:41,339
there's a lot of reasons but it usually

768
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:44,519
kind of pushes pushes pushes out on that

769
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:45,778
but uh you know Germany's uh very

770
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,538
interesting a matter of fact we're going

771
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:50,519
to moderate a panel during MJ Biz in Las

772
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,898
Vegas with some of the leading German

773
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,778
operators

774
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:56,339
uh so yeah Germany's uh a very

775
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:57,960
interesting Market but you know you

776
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:59,459
never know this you know maybe all of a

777
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,019
sudden South America will light up or

778
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,220
Australia is definitely doing some

779
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:04,679
interesting things certainly on the

780
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,839
medical side too so but one other point

781
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,500
too I want to mention this question the

782
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:12,000
U.S market right now is potentially and

783
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,579
probably you know the biggest Market

784
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,919
especially with adult use

785
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:20,939
but you know with all the problems the

786
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:23,580
U.S has as we've just discussed and if

787
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,558
other countries like Germany really

788
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:28,259
skirt those or don't deal with those and

789
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:30,658
they're allowed to grow in a different

790
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,398
set of regulations because they're not

791
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:35,580
regulating cannabis in the different

792
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:39,058
states in Germany like Baden furtenberg

793
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:42,119
et cetera and Bavaria it's National like

794
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:44,099
Canada has done so that could make you

795
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,418
know the U.S if the US doesn't watch it

796
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:47,639
and I mentioned this in my talk in

797
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,320
Frankfurt I mean there's no guarantee

798
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,960
the U.S Market's going to be the biggest

799
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:54,418
baddest cannabis Market in the world

800
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,519
uh in the coming years it may stay that

801
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,140
way but our politicians have to frankly

802
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,879
get you know their stuff together and

803
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,020
and help out the industry because I

804
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,520
think everybody in this industry

805
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:05,220
appreciates the fact that there's a lot

806
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,379
of impedances that we talked about and

807
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,419
we need to get rid of those some some of

808
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,278
those to really help the industry

809
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:15,179
get to where it need where it should be

810
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,019
frankly Ben so yeah absolutely and so as

811
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,640
you're looking at these different

812
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:19,740
countries you know going back to

813
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,720
Innovation which ones do you think are

814
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,519
the furthest along in terms of you know

815
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,899
coming out with new Innovations for the

816
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,879
industry

817
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:29,879
well it's got to be Israel right

818
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Israel's been at this I mean Rafi

819
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,120
mashulum

820
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:38,220
elucidated you know THC and structure in

821
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,798
1964. uh I mean that's the one thing

822
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,380
that we can also bring up in in can Med

823
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,000
that I think is really interesting if

824
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,860
you look at really the evolution of

825
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,720
biotechnology in this question you have

826
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:51,740
on Innovations I think appropriate place

827
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,778
to cover it you know biotech they they

828
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,899
Watson and Crick found the DNA structure

829
00:31:54,778 --> 00:32:00,480
of DNA in 1953 and then 20 years later

830
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:03,000
in 1973 you had Cohen and Boyer with

831
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,339
their seminal technology recombinant

832
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,278
technology discovery that that Stanford

833
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:09,959
made a ton of money out of frankly uh

834
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,720
and then you know five years later from

835
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,480
that it's 1978 you had Genentech go do

836
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,700
an IPO and then you had you know this

837
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,558
burgeoning blow up of Biotech in the

838
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,080
early 80s into the 90s

839
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:25,079
but then you counter that with you know

840
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,879
cannabis and innovation in cannabis

841
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,980
really has been slow

842
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,080
you know it seems like every you know

843
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,880
maybe that's because I've never thought

844
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,558
about this before Ben but maybe it's a

845
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,240
problem because everybody works in

846
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,980
cannabis smokes too much cannabis and

847
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,778
that's why it's slow moving they can't

848
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,860
get off the cat no it's just a joke but

849
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:44,099
I mean

850
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:46,500
as I mentioned Rafi mashulum finds THC

851
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:48,959
or obstruction defines that and and I

852
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,778
think isolated in 1964.

853
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,558
and then you had I think it was 1985

854
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:58,278
where he had Marinol get a

855
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:02,519
accepted for Market by the FDR approved

856
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:04,919
and then 1993 you had the identification

857
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,898
or early 90s anyway the elucidation of

858
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:08,940
the endocannabinoid system

859
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:12,538
I mean how many years ago was that

860
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,519
almost 30 years ago so and then you've

861
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:17,640
had a number of things and then I think

862
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:21,599
was it 2008 when you had epidiolex

863
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:25,320
uh approved I mean it's just Innovations

864
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:28,019
gotta has to be there's got to be more

865
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:30,178
rapidity and quicker development of

866
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:32,339
cannabis cannabis Innovation I think

867
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:34,200
it's going to start happening and a lot

868
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:36,000
of that's I think going to be due to New

869
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,620
Capital coming in and hopefully the idea

870
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,898
is to catalyze some of that with the

871
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:42,658
capital markets today at kanman

872
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:45,479
right no and it all it all comes back to

873
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,278
regulations and the legality of it as

874
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,558
well right I mean I got to think that

875
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:52,380
that's got to be an impediment to

876
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:54,658
Innovation and investment too I would

877
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,720
think is you know that this especially

878
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:59,580
in the US there's this gray area of okay

879
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,740
it's legal in my state but it's not

880
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,418
legal federally I don't know if I really

881
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,700
want to get into this

882
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:08,220
yeah well there's a couple things that I

883
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,398
think on that point we're interesting I

884
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:13,618
mean when I first jumped into it in 2013

885
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,358
and you know 2014 at Cerna you know it

886
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:17,338
was not easy to find good people because

887
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,259
a lot of people back then and it's

888
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:22,079
definitely changed but they were like

889
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,119
okay well if I get into this it jump

890
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,319
into cannabis or a marijuana company it

891
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,000
doesn't work and that's on my resume

892
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,899
what happens and nobody had the answer

893
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,059
to that

894
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:31,500
and obviously I think that stigma is

895
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:33,480
certainly going away in a number of

896
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,219
respects but I mean if you look back on

897
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,119
the conversations I was having with some

898
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,398
groups

899
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,599
uh company here in Colorado that was

900
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:41,279
doing some interesting thing with plant

901
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,659
genetics and they looked at cannabis and

902
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,280
this is 2013 2014. uh but they were like

903
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,780
yeah we're staying the hell away from I

904
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,260
mean because we talked to some people

905
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:56,159
that were patent examiners and USPTO and

906
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:58,500
back then the idea banned with patents

907
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,480
was well if you're a cannabis company

908
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,119
good luck with it because the only

909
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,000
the healthy group that had a patent

910
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,220
issued uh in cannabis at that time was

911
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,960
the U.S government and most of the

912
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:13,199
people were saying well you can't really

913
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,699
get a cannabis patent through USPTO or

914
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,259
the fact that you know if it does get

915
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:17,639
litigated or whatever it has to go into

916
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,020
a court of law and they're not going to

917
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,000
accept it because it's cannabis and

918
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:22,920
National legal that certainly has

919
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,858
changed now because yeah there's a lot

920
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:29,639
of people now applying for patents so it

921
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:31,500
it takes time uh but the thought is you

922
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:33,598
know it's unfortunately it's taking more

923
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,059
time than we've really wanted it to

924
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,660
but Innovation also as we talked about

925
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:38,659
takes time

926
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,040
absolutely all right so winding down

927
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,960
here and Before I Let You Go David I

928
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,900
wanted to give you an opportunity to
