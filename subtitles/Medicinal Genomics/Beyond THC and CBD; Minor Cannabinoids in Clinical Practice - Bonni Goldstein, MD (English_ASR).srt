1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,139
good morning everybody

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,000
isn't this a great conference

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,439
I've been having a great time I said

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,599
they have to have it here every year

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,798
because they can't really do better than

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,679
this so I'm

7
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm working on that all right so

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,879
um you guys all know my background I

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,379
think I'm a trained as a pediatrician I

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,479
worked in pediatric emergency medicine

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:29,759
for many years uh had a little

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,520
need for some sanity took some time off

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079
and my friend was fighting cancer asked

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,239
me about cannabis and that was my

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,280
introduction was to do research for my

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:43,019
friend and

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,539
um uh it's I haven't looked back so

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,100
um let's see I think this is a fine

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,079
setup for me so I'm just going to talk

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,539
about the minor cannabinoids in clinical

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,539
practice you've heard some about this

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,520
already from Dr Russo and from other

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,039
speakers as well

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,039
um and here is the phytocannabinoid

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,739
synthesis

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,019
showing that cbga is kind of the mother

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,820
uh the precursor of all the other

28
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,039
compounds and as you can see we have

29
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:15,179
numerous Rock compounds heated and as

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,840
well as aged remember too they're cbgva

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,820
which is apparent to the Varin line and

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,640
today we're going to talk about the ones

33
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,099
that I'm circling here I do agree with

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,319
daddy that we can no longer call in

35
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,140
which he mentioned yesterday we can no

36
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,579
longer call CBG a minor cannabinoid I

37
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,340
think it has moved up into the big

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,379
leagues and so it's becoming very

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,200
popular it clearly has incredible

40
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:42,599
benefits and that is what I'm going to

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,879
be showing you now for first we'll talk

42
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,798
about CBG so here's all the targets so

43
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,359
again

44
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,520
multi-targets very hard to predict

45
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,099
somebody's underlying chemistry and how

46
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,780
they're going to respond to CBG but the

47
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,399
one I want to point out the star should

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,659
be a little further down that Alpha 2

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,560
adrenergic because it is what stands out

50
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,478
separately from some of the other

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,560
cannabinoids we don't see that with the

52
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:10,978
other cannabinoids in this particular

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,719
Target can help with numerous disorders

54
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,060
and I do see it help with numerous

55
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,739
disorders and then I also just want to

56
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,180
point out the trip channels I find that

57
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,920
a lot of people don't really know what

58
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,319
those are so here I'm just going to give

59
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,000
you a cheat sheet so take a picture it's

60
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,659
a lovely article

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,300
and this is your trip Channel this is a

62
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:33,000
family of ion channels that was

63
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,200
discovered in 1969 they promote sodium

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,139
and calcium influx uh into cells they're

65
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,579
involved in many diseases uh including

66
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:44,098
neuropathic pain inflammation

67
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,080
respiratory disorders they're activated

68
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,419
by many different triggers including

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,400
heat cold mechanical skin changes so

70
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:54,238
like when your skin stretches that's

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,180
your trip channels spicy foods toxins if

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,580
you've ever had really good freshly made

73
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,200
olive oil you get that peppery taste in

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,680
the back of your throat that's with your

75
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,839
trip channels and also of course by

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,879
cannabinoids here are some of the ones

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,120
that we know that cannabinoids Target

78
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,620
there are many more trip channels and

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,319
here's your cheat sheet what what are

80
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,180
they involved in so nervous system gut

81
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,280
immune does that sound like the

82
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,459
endocannabinoid system yes it does and

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,739
the skin pain inflammation inflammation

84
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,259
itch and cancer there are many other

85
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,599
things but this is just giving you kind

86
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,280
of a boiled down way to think about trip

87
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:34,079
channels when you read about it in the

88
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,158
research or somebody's talking about it

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,040
as a target for cannabinoids

90
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:44,519
um so CBG is anti-cancer through the

91
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,259
trip M8 and you can see here's CBG

92
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,360
hampers colon cancer progression

93
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,878
selectively inhibits the growth of

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,739
colorectal uh tumors and again this is a

95
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,239
preclinical model this is not a human

96
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:58,080
model

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,539
uh also we have now Canada showing uh

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,980
potential for glioblastoma multiformi

99
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,439
which has been talked about quite a bit

100
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,259
at this conference uh remember that this

101
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,900
is a condition that is quite deadly 200

102
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,000
000 people die each year 15 000 in

103
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,139
Europe 9 000 in the U.S according to

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,060
gliocore.com and CBG was found to be

105
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,699
comparable to THC and Killingly

106
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,759
oblastoma cells inhibiting the invasion

107
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,900
of these cancer cells and also very

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,240
importantly

109
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,978
uh destroying the therapy resistance

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,478
stem cells and those are those stem

111
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,219
cells you get you may go through

112
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,560
treatment be told that you have no

113
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,440
evidence of disease but you still have

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,259
some of these cells lurking uh Jeff

115
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,180
hergan rather a fellow cannabis

116
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,699
physician in California has been doing

117
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,340
this longer than I have had a patient

118
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,160
who stayed on cannabis for nine years

119
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:52,439
after his glioblastoma was surgically

120
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,020
removed and he stopped cannabis and his

121
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,600
cancer came back I had a patient in my

122
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:00,839
practice three and a half years with

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,460
glioblastoma was doing great decided to

124
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,500
travel the world with his kids and left

125
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,719
his cannabis at home and he and he

126
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,459
relapsed within six five or six weeks I

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,500
think and unfortunately when it came

128
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,599
back it came back with a vengeance so

129
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,079
it's my opinion that if you are you get

130
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,800
to Ned with or without cannabis you

131
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,240
probably should continue to use cannabis

132
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,100
as what else are you going to take you

133
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,379
can't take chemotherapy and get radiated

134
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,580
right so what else can you do you and

135
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:28,860
take care of yourself but include

136
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:30,959
cannabinoids as part of your anti-cancer

137
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,340
protocol and I tell this to every

138
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,159
patient and I'll just share one last

139
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:37,638
story I had a three-year-old come to me

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,820
who had a terrible

141
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,819
version or chromosomal type of leukemia

142
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,199
she and at three it's so difficult to

143
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,759
treat these kids because they're aware

144
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,740
enough to know what you're doing but

145
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,939
they're not old enough to understand so

146
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,978
it is torture for them and she ended up

147
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:57,779
getting a bone marrow transplant she

148
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:59,758
relapsed three months later came to see

149
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,619
me she was in remission with cannabis

150
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,020
and a plant-based diet alone in eight

151
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,060
weeks that's pretty quick

152
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,579
they stayed on cannabis for eight months

153
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,978
I don't know what happened in the family

154
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,198
but apparently there was some disruption

155
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:15,240
in the family unit they couldn't afford

156
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,120
the Cannabis they didn't call me and she

157
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,860
relapsed about three months later and

158
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,399
then got another bone marrow transplant

159
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,199
and died from fungal pneumonia so and by

160
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,758
the way her bone marrow when they

161
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,639
checked her bone marrow it had 100

162
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,160
grafted so she was actually doing really

163
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,620
well and I really do think that going

164
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,720
off cannabis was probably not a great

165
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,639
thing

166
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,259
um what else about CBG so it reduces

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,418
neuroinflammation so this is a

168
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,300
pre-clinical study looking at CBG alone

169
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:47,519
and in combination with CBD CBG alone

170
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,379
wasn't really found to be effective CBD

171
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,939
was effective at a very high dose but

172
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,459
when combined as you've heard over and

173
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:57,740
over during this conference it was the

174
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:57,739
most effective down regulating

175
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,579
pro-inflammatory compounds and

176
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,680
increasing anti-inflammatory compounds

177
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:07,579
and then they also showed in this study

178
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,439
some p-par mediated anti-inflammatory

179
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:12,180
antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects

180
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,219
so remember the pipars are The receptors

181
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,259
that sit on the nucleus inside the cell

182
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:22,560
also interacting with cannabinoids

183
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:24,360
analgesic we know that from this

184
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,680
particular study that it reduced

185
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,598
chemo-induced mechanical

186
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,900
hypersensitivity which is kind of a

187
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:33,060
model of neuropathic pain a combo of CBD

188
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:36,478
and CBG here it is again was more

189
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,478
effective than CBG alone

190
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,339
now I found three articles on appetite

191
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,459
stimulation I do have patients that tell

192
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:46,198
me that CBG make gives them the munchies

193
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:48,478
and I don't think that happens for

194
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,819
everybody but reading through these

195
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,918
articles there's some indication that

196
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,780
CBG may help with chemotherapy

197
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,818
Associated weight loss and loss of

198
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,379
appetite and who might this help well

199
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,598
someone who might be reluctant to take

200
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:03,240
THC they're getting drug tested at work

201
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:06,000
or they don't like the effects of THC or

202
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,860
they don't have access to THC so this

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,860
might work be helpful for patients I

204
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,500
think it's still I'm still not sure

205
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,139
exactly if this is a a true effect I

206
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,660
have not treated anybody who has this

207
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,120
particular indication

208
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,039
um now also metabolic homeostasis so

209
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,899
this is a really interesting article I

210
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,519
had to read it about five times to

211
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,019
understand it

212
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,659
um and but what's really interesting

213
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:33,598
about it is that it showed that CBG

214
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,599
acting through P par improved insulin

215
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,879
sensitivity and we thcv gets a lot of

216
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,240
credit for that but CBG appears to do

217
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,158
something very similar also improves

218
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,580
adipogenesis so what is that that's

219
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,720
that's laying creating fat cells now you

220
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,379
might think well we don't want to do

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,360
that but remember that there is a

222
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:56,338
physiologic reason that you have fat you

223
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,659
just don't want to have too much fat and

224
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,820
part of that is to help prevent

225
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:02,939
lipotoxicity of organs you don't want

226
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:06,300
your lipids to get into your heart and

227
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,980
your liver and other organs and so CBG

228
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:10,500
appears appears to help with this

229
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,500
metabolic homeostasis

230
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,240
it's also anti-soriatic having skin

231
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,620
effects and I think there was a can Med

232
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,480
a couple years ago that someone did this

233
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,519
presented this it inhibit inhibited

234
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,220
pro-inflammatory cytokine release due to

235
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,899
certain triggers including UV light

236
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,480
chemical irritation and bacteria that

237
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:34,200
causes acne and in some cases was more

238
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,360
potent than CBD for this indication

239
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,339
now uh Ethan touched on this yesterday

240
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,259
so I'm not going to spend too much time

241
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,019
on it but this was the first survey of

242
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,879
patients using CBG and these are the

243
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,220
most common conditions that he discussed

244
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,080
and uh needless to say it was highly

245
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,000
rated by participants and reported

246
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,220
graded greater efficacy than

247
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,320
Pharmaceuticals with some mild side

248
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,839
effects which appeared to be THC related

249
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,760
as some patients had preparations that

250
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,180
had THC in it

251
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,740
now we're going to move on to cbda Ben

252
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,679
will you give me a heads up at five

253
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,778
minutes by the way thanks okay so here's

254
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,059
your cbda targets I actually had to

255
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:14,939
change this yesterday I had to recreate

256
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:17,219
because I've been uh you know looking at

257
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,260
the literature there's no CB1 CB2

258
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,120
activity and lo and behold what do you

259
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,980
find when you look to make sure you're

260
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,360
not leaving something out that the

261
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,879
latest literature because it's kind of

262
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,980
coming down pretty quick in that same

263
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,778
study that I just talked about they

264
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,820
report that cbda does ACT through CB2 at

265
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:39,360
least what happened was when they used a

266
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,040
CB2 Agonist it blocked this effect so

267
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,720
there may be something else there but it

268
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,958
is a signal that maybe there is some

269
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,879
activity at CB2 and again uh what is

270
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,859
this this is converting bone marrow

271
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:54,539
mesenchymal stem cells uh to

272
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,180
a fat cells so in increased

273
00:10:54,539 --> 00:11:00,000
proliferation and so very interesting

274
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:02,039
and then uh I was really happy to find

275
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,458
this because Dr mashulum did this in

276
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,659
February this was published February 23.

277
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:10,319
cannabinoid receptor two blockade

278
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:13,679
prevents antidepressant like effects

279
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,140
um using the uh the more stabilized

280
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,359
version of cannabidiol in female rats

281
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:22,439
and so if you want to take a look at

282
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:25,919
that another study that showed some that

283
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,779
blockade blocks the effect and is cbda

284
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,639
working through that CB2 mechanism

285
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:31,458
whether directly or indirectly we don't

286
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,958
know yet

287
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,939
in terms of anti-convulsant effects

288
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,799
there's two studies that came out again

289
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,720
pre-clinical and you can see here that

290
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,819
they look we're looking at

291
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,820
pharmacokinetics of the phytocannabinoid

292
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,860
acids and also the anti-convulsant

293
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,120
effect of cbda in a mouse model of

294
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,539
Gervais if you're not familiar with

295
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,959
Gervais it's a genetic disorder that

296
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:58,199
causes very severe neuro cognitive

297
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00,299
problems and also horrific seizures in

298
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,820
children and it appears about two years

299
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,439
of life so these children kind of look

300
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,140
healthy for the first two years of life

301
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,779
and then they start having terrible

302
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,179
seizures usually in response to heat or

303
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:14,879
a fever and then it just goes downhill

304
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:19,019
from there what did cbda do and you can

305
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:20,700
see the two bars to the right at cbda

306
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,159
significantly increase the temperature

307
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,660
threshold I actually had a druvet

308
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,519
patient come into my office when the air

309
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:28,199
conditioning was out and the parents

310
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,839
would not bring her into my office we

311
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,278
had to do the uh the evaluation out in

312
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,899
the hallway way because they were

313
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,519
terrified with the heat in the office

314
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,519
that she would have seizures so this is

315
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,970
a real concern so cbda has some

316
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,120
signaling here for

317
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,019
[Music]

318
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,720
anti-convulsant activity and here's

319
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,179
another one exhibiting entourage-like

320
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,220
Improvement so in this study in in rats

321
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,319
what they did was they created a

322
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,300
compound called that they called

323
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,820
kylobinoid 74 cbda but other

324
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:59,359
cannabinoids included and they also use

325
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,600
this model of adding a magnesium to help

326
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,778
these compounds transport through lipid

327
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,120
barriers lipid cell barriers then they

328
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,278
had a magnesium cbda it's almost like a

329
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,060
pure cbda and you can see it does not

330
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:17,399
have the CBD and the thca has slightly

331
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:19,619
less THC also has similar amount of

332
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,659
magnesium and then they compared it to a

333
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,740
CBD isolate 99.99 99

334
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:27,659
and all the compounds were

335
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,980
anti-convulsant but the kylobinoid

336
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,860
exhibited potency at a level

337
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:36,240
statistically significant uh similar to

338
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,519
CBD and also the minimal effective dose

339
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:43,379
of the kylobinoid was significantly

340
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:46,139
lower despite having a less potency of

341
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,679
cbda can when it compared to that

342
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:52,799
magnesium cbda that didn't have the

343
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,778
other compounds and so again this kind

344
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,419
of points to Synergy or Entourage so

345
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:59,338
remember that that's part of it as well

346
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,919
and so that was an interesting study

347
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:05,100
I've used cbda in some of my pediatric

348
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,199
patients with a severe intractable

349
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,200
epilepsy who did not do well with either

350
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,759
CBD or thca or THC and you have to

351
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,259
remember in California things kind of

352
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,360
came down the line it wasn't all

353
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:18,600
available at once so I got to introduce

354
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,300
things kind of in a chronologic way and

355
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,300
kind of see how they worked cbda does

356
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:26,519
show some activity for some patients a

357
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:28,919
lot of the families say my child just

358
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,078
seemed less agitated and is that

359
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,719
treating the neuroinflammation possibly

360
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,419
is it overall inflammation is it gut

361
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,700
brain it's hard to know

362
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:41,219
and so a nice article if you want to

363
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,440
look for motto in 2020 gave this nice

364
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,300
slide of just kind of the summaries and

365
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,300
so you can see this anti-inflammatory

366
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:50,458
effect it not only uh the receptor level

367
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:52,319
but also transcript transcriptional

368
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:55,379
level and the enzymatic level lowering

369
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,100
Cox II antiemetic in the way that it

370
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:01,019
interacts with the five ht1a and I have

371
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,278
used cbda I had a patient a breast

372
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:08,339
cancer patient many years ago who was on

373
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,039
high doses of THC and CBD she was quite

374
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:13,019
tolerant to the THC at that point and

375
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,480
she started a new chemo which made her

376
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,759
have terrible nausea and vomiting and

377
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,100
low-dose cbda took care of that so we

378
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,838
just added it in I don't know that it's

379
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,459
a n of one I don't know if that will

380
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,959
work for everybody else but it's

381
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,638
something to think about in patients who

382
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,419
either don't want to take THC as an

383
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,220
anti-medic or who need an add-on I've

384
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:34,439
already talked about anti-convulsant and

385
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,420
then also anti-cancerogenic and so

386
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,040
there's some evidence in breast cancer a

387
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,659
couple breast cancer studies that show

388
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,759
decreased cell proliferation and

389
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,679
decreased cell migration so just a nice

390
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,720
study of the summary of the medicinal

391
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,819
properties

392
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,740
here's a patient report so this is at

393
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,240
the other end of the spectrum I still

394
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,459
have adult patients that I follow for

395
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,159
many many years this is a 91 year old

396
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:58,799
male who has been a patient for six

397
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,958
years I'm smiling because every time he

398
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,958
sees me he always asks me how's Dr Russo

399
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,819
he's a huge fan so I just wanted to let

400
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,399
you know Ethan

401
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,680
um yes tell him I say hi so uh

402
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,240
age-related ailments Avid Reader of the

403
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,819
Cannabis research which he only

404
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,799
discovered as he was older he had

405
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,660
arthritis and insomnia which California

406
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,578
I can approve him but he was really

407
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:22,980
looking for wellness that's what he said

408
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:25,679
to me I want Wellness I want to be well

409
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,500
in my old age and so he was taking a

410
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,599
low-dose preparation of four to one CBD

411
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,759
to THC that's what he found to work well

412
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,180
for him it helped his arthritis and it

413
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:39,059
helped his sleep then I got a call from

414
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:42,059
him that he had developed gout and he

415
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:44,518
was given opioids by his primary care

416
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:46,679
and he said not only do they not work

417
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,600
but I haven't pooped in about two weeks

418
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,278
and I'm miserable and he actually said

419
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,839
to me I don't want to live if this is

420
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,600
how I have to live you have to help me

421
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,139
the four to one help but it really did

422
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,699
not take care of his pain and what the

423
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,399
other thing is it was restricting his

424
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:05,399
ability to be mobile he was sitting at

425
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,318
home with his leg elevated and putting

426
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,880
ice on and he's a guy who likes he lives

427
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:13,078
near the water he likes to go out for a

428
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,000
walk and uh um very active uh

429
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:18,480
um older person

430
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,338
so he happened to have some cbda

431
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,620
capsules that I had recommended the last

432
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:24,558
time when he came to see me for his

433
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:27,479
arthritis it was a fairly new product

434
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:30,298
and so these capsules come as 25

435
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,460
milligrams if you've tasted uh some of

436
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:35,099
the cbda preparations out there anybody

437
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,340
have a bad experience or very very yeah

438
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:40,319
so Kevin they're really difficult uh

439
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,819
they're just terrible taste and people

440
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,159
don't like them so I didn't want to turn

441
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,659
them off to it so I just started them on

442
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,700
two capsules twice a day and by the way

443
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,798
I was looked I didn't feel that I had

444
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,419
time to start lower and go up I wanted

445
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,879
to kind of hit them hard and get the

446
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:55,740
inflammation down I gave him dosing

447
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,140
instructions over a period of two weeks

448
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,298
he did it in six days and a complete

449
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,679
resolution of the pain after two weeks

450
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:03,298
he said you know it's a little pricey

451
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,640
I'm going to try to lower my dose but

452
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:08,700
the pain returned and he figured out if

453
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,799
he took 150 milligrams once a day that

454
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,720
his pain was fine last time I talked to

455
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,400
him was to renew his letter and he said

456
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,960
everything's fine I don't really have

457
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,059
time to talk to you're gonna we're gonna

458
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,220
have to reschedule because I'm having

459
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:22,139
lunch with my friend and I think he

460
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,259
forgot the appointment

461
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,000
um and so he remains pain-free and so he

462
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:30,359
continues to take his low dose four to

463
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,500
one and he's still taking his cbda

464
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:36,000
now let's talk about thca so again

465
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,440
multi-targets and the reason I made

466
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,058
these charts was because I was starting

467
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,580
to get confused and which which

468
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:44,700
cannabinoid targets which receptors it's

469
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,980
hard to remember them all and so I uh

470
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,759
made these uh targets and we know that

471
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,140
thca does have some activity at CB1 and

472
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,419
CB2 and again you have to remember

473
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,919
though that thca is very hard to isolate

474
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,538
completely there's always going to be a

475
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,759
tiny little bit of THC so it's always

476
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:02,099
hard to know when somebody has a

477
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,859
response to thca is it because of that

478
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:07,199
little bit of low-dose THC that might be

479
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:09,538
in the product so here's some three

480
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,558
studies that I wanted just to show you

481
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:11,460
so

482
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,579
um

483
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:18,600
thca reducing adiposity and helping with

484
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:20,819
metabolic syndrome also thca is a potent

485
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:24,839
P par Agonist showing neuroprotective

486
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:27,839
activity and then this last one from uh

487
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,298
hananit who's here in in the room so

488
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,918
thank you for your research showing

489
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:33,859
anti-inflammatory activity through the

490
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,140
GPR 55

491
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:39,178
receptor it's different Labs find

492
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,038
different affinities and that's why it's

493
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,640
kind of hard to know what's happening at

494
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:46,740
the cannabinoid receptors we also know

495
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,200
that thca can be a very potent

496
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,700
anti-nausea medicine in very low Doses

497
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,580
and of course I've used it for

498
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,220
anti-inflammatory of

499
00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:00,839
effects in my patients

500
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,940
oh I'm sorry that bottom one should be

501
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,678
not there but you can see the top one is

502
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,600
an article that Dustin and I published

503
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,700
along with Dr Russell cenito who's a

504
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:11,459
neurologist at Seattle Children's

505
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,220
Hospital and if you'd like to read about

506
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,558
thcam pediatric epilepsy there's a

507
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,880
really nice

508
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,500
section in there that Dustin wrote

509
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,919
that's really beautiful and explains

510
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,079
thca quite well and then here's another

511
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,559
article that came out

512
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,418
uh showing some uh possible

513
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,819
anti-convulsant effects this was really

514
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:35,038
mixed and what they found was a focal

515
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,200
seizure model the thca was

516
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,179
anti-convulsive but only when THC was

517
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,558
present with it but it wasn't effective

518
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,538
and it was also found to be Pro

519
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,960
convulsant in some other seizure models

520
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:48,179
in the purified forms I have used thca

521
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,640
in my patients and I'm going to share

522
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,780
with you one of my stories so this is an

523
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,020
actual

524
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:56,759
Chief complaint list of a 17 year old

525
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,679
that came to see me the mom has to type

526
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,019
it out because she has no room to put it

527
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,059
on the paperwork that we give her so he

528
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,339
started off being he's a was born in the

529
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:07,319
year 2000 and he was diagnosed with

530
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:10,139
autism followed by seizure disorder

531
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,058
hypoglycemia polydipsia sodium imbalance

532
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,299
finally got genetic work up

533
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:17,038
mitochondrial disorder with all kinds of

534
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:18,298
variants in the genes that you can see

535
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,660
listed there and I don't know that

536
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:23,579
anybody knows I think he's a unicorn

537
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:27,179
um cyclical vomiting syndrome hearing

538
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:30,119
loss OCD pandas and the pandas

539
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:32,340
um oftentimes is fine until the spring

540
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,899
and then in the spring he gets pandas I

541
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:36,119
have another other kids that do that too

542
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,580
and I don't know if it's pollen or

543
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,678
something else that's triggering them uh

544
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:43,079
intestinal malabsorption he's also got

545
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,880
some hard stuff going on

546
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,399
um and he's just a really challenging

547
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,980
patient and then after showing me this

548
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,960
we get this look at all of what the mom

549
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:56,640
calls allergies so gluten casein soy

550
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,679
antibiotics antivirals and if you look

551
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,440
you can see what happens rash tongue

552
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,740
swelling hives and so on if you go down

553
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,779
a little bit you'll see Omega 3 6 9 EPA

554
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,120
GLA all the fatty acids severe

555
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:11,519
aggression Mania self-injurious

556
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,099
regardless of dosage so I was a little

557
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,379
nervous to give him cannabis because of

558
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:18,240
the lipophilic nature but the mother was

559
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,159
willing to try because nothing else was

560
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,259
working and she really did not want to

561
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,419
continue to give him any more

562
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:27,298
Pharmaceuticals

563
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:29,820
and even uh he you can see reacts to

564
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:31,859
garlic and onions and coffee I mean he

565
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:34,558
again he's a real unicorn

566
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:36,178
so he was having seizures every 20 to 30

567
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,859
days on average there were clear-cut

568
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,019
triggers if they wake him up in the

569
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,699
morning instead of allowing him to wake

570
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:44,639
up on his own he'll have a terrible

571
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,558
seizure I know people think it's crazy

572
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,120
there's two articles one that says yay

573
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,399
and one that says nay about the full

574
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,439
moon the mother says he has seizures

575
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,360
around the full moon and I also I will

576
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,460
tell you I have the full the moon app on

577
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,959
my phone because my phone lights up

578
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,538
around the full moon with seizure kids

579
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,819
so there's something there they did try

580
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:05,339
CBD before seeing me she gave him one

581
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:07,319
drop and she said he was horrific the

582
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:10,558
rest of the day he was completely Manic

583
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:14,099
and self-agre self-injurious so she came

584
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:16,980
to me asking for advice I was so nervous

585
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:18,538
I was really reluctant to put him on

586
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,700
cannabis but I wanted to try to help him

587
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:22,980
so I started him and by the way at the

588
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:27,000
time I didn't have everything that we

589
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:29,519
have now what I had was CBD THC and thca

590
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,798
so we decided to go with thca he started

591
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,460
with one drop and after just one drop

592
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,200
drop I think it was per day he went 57

593
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,840
days which was longer than he had gone

594
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,360
in quite some time and so we continued

595
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,899
to titrate up literally adding one drop

596
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:48,178
at a time and the longest he went was

597
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,798
229 days which was really exciting of

598
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,080
course there's all these still there's

599
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,298
still a lot of triggers mom keeps track

600
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,220
you know we get 150 days and then he'll

601
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:58,519
have a seizure sometimes it's seven days

602
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,259
if there's some something else going on

603
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,058
surprisingly I'm um when he got sick

604
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:05,339
with covid he didn't have too many

605
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:07,019
seizures he's on a pretty high dose as

606
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:10,199
you can see we've just been titrating up

607
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:14,099
over years 60 to 80 milligrams per day

608
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,980
she does regular tid dosing plus PRN

609
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:19,259
dosing he has no side effects

610
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,940
and he's on two different team of ours

611
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:23,579
from two different companies as that

612
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,900
seems to be what helps him and this is

613
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,460
kind of the art of medicine and the

614
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,580
evolution of following a patient over

615
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,679
time one thing I'll share is that when

616
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:33,178
cbdv came out which I'm going to talk

617
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,820
about next and I'm going to pack it into

618
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:37,679
a few minutes here

619
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:39,599
we tried one drop and he had a seizure

620
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,400
so we just decided not to try it and

621
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,439
she's very happy with what we have now

622
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,659
and you know this is why it's so

623
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,240
important for new cannabinoids to come

624
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:50,400
out for us to be able to help these kids

625
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,279
who are unicorns

626
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,620
so here's your targets of cbdv again

627
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,259
questionable activity at CB2 but

628
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:00,719
definitely GPR 55 and I'm going to talk

629
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:02,579
about this Gaba rundown also a little

630
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,579
bit of activity at the trip channels

631
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,678
there's a patent out from 2018 that

632
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:10,379
shows that cbdv is effective at reducing

633
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,600
pain better than CBD for both thermal

634
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,880
hyperalgesia and mechanical alleginian a

635
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,339
mouse model of neuropathic pain I

636
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,860
haven't tried it yet in Europe I have

637
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:24,139
tried it I haven't gotten a response yet

638
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:28,619
or feedback yet and then this the trip

639
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:30,960
V1 also thought to be a target for the

640
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,178
anti-convulsant effects and if you look

641
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,940
here you can see that the epileptic

642
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,278
brain on the left side is showing this

643
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,919
increase in trip Channel phosphorylation

644
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:44,278
and sensitization and then the epileptic

645
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:47,159
brain on cbdv has lowering of that which

646
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,200
it tips that excitatory message to the

647
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,278
inhibitory message so that's the idea

648
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,400
one of the ideas with cbdv and then also

649
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm just going to mention this one other

650
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,140
study about cbdv lowers intestinal

651
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,298
inflammation and myosin in pediatric

652
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:07,020
ulcerative colitis biopsy tissue where

653
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:09,658
trip one V1 is uh up regulated and so

654
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:11,038
you there's the um article for that if

655
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,360
you want to read about that and I was

656
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,419
kind of thinking as I was putting the

657
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:18,778
slides together cbdv and thca might be a

658
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:20,278
nice combination for inflammatory bowel

659
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,880
disease

660
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:25,798
um in a non-um intoxicating way and then

661
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,900
this is just comes from that

662
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:30,900
um same article showing

663
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,278
um the pathway that cbdv uh lowers that

664
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,380
inflammation

665
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:36,778
all right and so there's this nice

666
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,159
article I think this came out of Italy a

667
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:41,460
number of years ago when they talk about

668
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,919
Gaba receptors and that cbdv recovers

669
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,019
recovers this idea of Gaba a receptor

670
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,580
rundown so I'm not a neurologist I

671
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,278
didn't know what that meant I did a deep

672
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:52,918
dive and my neurologist friend here is

673
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:56,460
shaking his head so what I found is that

674
00:26:52,919 --> 00:27:00,299
in drug resistant epilepsy the constant

675
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:03,058
seizures basically wipe out Gaba and the

676
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:06,418
the pathways are run down exactly what

677
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:09,839
it sounds like and cbdv in animal models

678
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:12,000
recover this rundown that's pretty a big

679
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,500
claim there and I think that I am seeing

680
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,019
that in my patients now there's other

681
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,119
studies uh multiple animal studies

682
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:19,619
reporting anti-convulsant effects of

683
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,418
cbdv

684
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:24,538
um getting to my end Ben so don't worry

685
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:28,380
uh case report of a young man with

686
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:29,700
Rasmussen Encephalitis in Italy who and

687
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,679
if you're not familiar with that it's a

688
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,778
terrible disease and you have terrible

689
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,720
seizures and it's just neurodegenerative

690
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:38,220
and he was taking a homemade cbdv Rich

691
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,778
preparation with significant

692
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,220
improvements in his quality of life

693
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:42,778
never thought to be able to graduate

694
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,360
high school he graduated high school he

695
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:47,819
was had improved verbal skills and they

696
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,859
plotted out and they even measured his

697
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:53,399
blood levels and when his blood levels

698
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:55,259
were high with cbdv he had a significant

699
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,778
Improvement now there was a clinical

700
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:59,278
trial at a GW Pharmaceutical with cbdv

701
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:01,079
and adults with poorly controlled focal

702
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,119
C seizures but it failed to reach the

703
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:05,939
primary endpoint

704
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,619
a study that came out in 2019 showed in

705
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,380
Mouse models of Rhett syndrome so again

706
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,479
this is like a unicorn syndrome uh

707
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,860
usually affecting females again they're

708
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,599
usually healthy for the first couple

709
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,939
years of life and then become quite ill

710
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,798
it's a genetic disorder and they have

711
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,620
all kinds of social impairments and

712
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:25,319
behavior issues they have odd hand

713
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:28,199
ringing kind of motions they have a

714
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:32,399
severe drug resistant epilepsy and so in

715
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,798
a mouse model cbdv restored rescued

716
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,960
social impairments short-term memory

717
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,500
deficits repetitive behaviors and a

718
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,538
hyper Locomotion and then also restored

719
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,700
endocannabinoid alterations from

720
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:47,519
prenatal exposure to valproic acid which

721
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,558
is the model for autism when we look at

722
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,720
a mouse model of autism so quite

723
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:53,278
interesting then we have the study that

724
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,380
was published last year a phase one

725
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:58,259
pediatric clinical trial from Australia

726
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,480
in five kids with red these were all

727
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:04,500
drug resistant patients one having as

728
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,759
many as 370 seizures a month month and

729
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,500
they started with two and a half

730
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,599
milligram per kilo per day and titrated

731
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,278
up in the same increment not going

732
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,019
further than 10 milligram per kilo

733
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,538
because they were told that it would

734
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:18,119
cause sedation and they saw this median

735
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:20,759
reduction of seizures 79 percent that

736
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:23,038
corresponded to an overall decrease 32

737
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,419
seizures to seven seizures a month and I

738
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,759
will tell you for families that live

739
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:29,120
with seizures all the parents have I

740
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,140
don't call it PTSD it's ongoing

741
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,879
traumatic stress disorder because they

742
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,159
never know where or when they might have

743
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,700
to call 9-1-1 or or if their child's

744
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,919
going to die just going from 32 to 7 a

745
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,480
month completely changes the quality of

746
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,580
life for everybody involved and remember

747
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,099
too less seizures mean the brain can

748
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:50,158
move forward a well tolerated with no

749
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:52,019
serious adverse effects and this is my

750
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,820
last slide so this is one of my very

751
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:57,658
long-term patients she was one of my

752
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:59,158
first pediatric drug resistant epilepsy

753
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:01,500
I've become very friendly with the mom

754
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,539
we go to we take I I give her respite

755
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,519
care by going with her to museums on the

756
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:07,798
weekends

757
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,819
because my husband won't go with me

758
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:10,859
um so

759
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:14,519
um so now so I when I first met her

760
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:16,798
she's night she was 19. she's almost 29

761
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,058
now and she's had seizures since age two

762
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,119
months

763
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:23,158
she is non-verbal she refi requires

764
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,658
full-time care she's in a wheelchair in

765
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,700
a diaper

766
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:29,580
um she has to be fed

767
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,460
uh this is what seizures do

768
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:34,199
during childhood

769
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,079
saying cannabis we don't know enough

770
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,460
about it is cruel we know enough to know

771
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,500
that it's safe and you have to try it

772
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,840
brings me to tears sorry

773
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,480
anyway highly refractory daily seizures

774
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,519
her brothers became really good at kind

775
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,380
of knowing the seizure was coming

776
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,879
and the mom even told me when I first

777
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,320
met them she said they're the ones that

778
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,880
will grab her and bring her to her bed

779
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,278
that's all kind of padded so she can't

780
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,760
get hurt imagine growing up that way her

781
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:02,099
two younger brothers 22 different

782
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:05,278
anti-epileptics knowing that after two

783
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:08,339
the chances of three four five six

784
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:11,339
eighteen nineteen twenty working is lit

785
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:14,339
really less than one to four percent

786
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:17,038
so she started CBD back in 2013 when it

787
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:19,199
was really hard to get and she had

788
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,759
greater than 50 reduction of seizures

789
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,798
kind of right out of the gate we

790
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,898
titrated up to six milligram per kilo

791
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,819
but she's sensitive to it if we went any

792
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:28,918
higher she started having some more

793
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:30,599
seizures we tried other cannabinoids

794
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,059
with minimal benefits

795
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:36,359
over time she's improved eye contact

796
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:38,759
started smiling just an overall Wellness

797
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,339
that the mother said she just is well

798
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,319
and those days seizure-free Days started

799
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:44,939
to

800
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,898
accumulate and as you can see and I

801
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,940
talked about this in the medical

802
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:50,639
practicum on Monday the longer you stay

803
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,380
on cannabinoids the better response you

804
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,538
get it shows up to two years you can

805
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,278
have an increase so I always prepare

806
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,538
patients what you see now doesn't mean

807
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:59,519
it's not going to get better later on

808
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:01,319
you have to give it a chance it's a

809
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,418
Botanical medicine it nudges it doesn't

810
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:06,000
hit hard she was able to wean one

811
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:07,860
medication no side effects with CBD but

812
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,679
she's still having some seizures so I

813
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:14,579
just started her on cbdv and she's been

814
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:16,320
seizure free become the combination and

815
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:18,658
um so she's on four milligram per kilo

816
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,460
per day of cbdv and six milligram per

817
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:22,860
kilo per day of CBD which is still

818
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,079
fairly affordable for the parents and

819
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:28,319
doing really well and as you can see she

820
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:31,579
looks uh pretty content right there

821
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,579
and thank you very much

822
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,440
I don't know if I have time for

823
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:42,298
questions

824
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,500
I think Ben left the room so go ahead

825
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:45,538
take questions

826
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,359
laughs

827
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:49,980
oh there he is one question okay I

828
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,298
thought you left I feel honored one

829
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,038
quick question first of all I'm very

830
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:55,379
humbled uh during this whole experience

831
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,879
experiencing all this sharing uh

832
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,159
experiences with everyone here so it's

833
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,340
very enlightening and very inspiring uh

834
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:07,380
I had a question with the CDMA uh uh CBD

835
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:10,500
a lot of letters yes regarding uh why

836
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,720
it's more efficacious than others uh for

837
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,278
this is it have to do more with the

838
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,919
blood brain barrier do you think it's

839
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:19,740
you mean cbda or

840
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,538
cbda cbda yes so I would say that if

841
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,538
you're asking about seizures I think

842
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:26,759
cbdv in my experience now and again this

843
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:29,460
is all just my anecdotal experience is

844
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,460
significantly better than cbda for

845
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,399
seizures but again I didn't have cbdv so

846
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,319
I got to try out cbda and I even have

847
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:39,298
another child right now the parents were

848
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:40,558
spending a fortune on the cbda and we

849
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:42,839
weren't sure it was making a difference

850
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:46,259
so we weaned down on that and introduce

851
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,720
cbdv I'm seeing a much better uh

852
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:50,220
um decrease in seizures that's just my

853
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,720
experience and it may be because it's

854
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,100
not penetrating the blood-brain barrier

855
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,480
there's some research showing that in

856
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:59,459
oil uh the ratio in plasma to brain is

857
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,079
not very good but that in a tween

858
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,298
emulsions like something that's an

859
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,519
emulsifying agent that actually that can

860
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:07,079
help uh get it through the blood-brain

861
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,179
barrier there is one product on the

862
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,159
market that does it but I just it's very

863
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,740
expensive so I have not I think I only

864
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,720
have one patient on it other current

865
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,358
clinical research studies looking at the

866
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,219
actual numbers in the spinal fluid is

867
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:21,898
there a way of actually obtaining spinal

868
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,519
fluid not in humans

869
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:26,098
no I don't think so

870
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:29,099
that'd be interesting it's hard to get a

871
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:30,300
parent to agree to to give spinal fluid

872
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,280
it's hard to get them to do it when you

873
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,919
think they have meningitis so well in

874
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,000
the emergency room yeah through LPS

875
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,699
right and there are studies that show

876
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,260
that when patients come in with like

877
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:41,878
first-time temporal lobe epilepsy if you

878
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,740
check spinal fluid there's low levels of

879
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:45,299
anandamide so certainly if somebody's

880
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,279
doing that kind of study might be able

881
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,960
to check and see if it's if it's there

882
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,800
it's all animal models like at this

883
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,358
point

884
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,359
thank you thank you everybody
