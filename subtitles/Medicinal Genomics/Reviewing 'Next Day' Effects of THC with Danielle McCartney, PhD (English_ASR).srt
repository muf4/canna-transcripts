my guest today is Dr Danielle McCartney

32
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,219
Danielle is a postdoctoral research

33
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,379
associate at the Lambert Initiative for

34
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:41,938
cannabinoid Therapeutics at the

35
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,158
University of Sydney

36
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,798
her main role is to coordinate Clinical

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,799
Research into the effects of cannabis on

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,780
simulated car driving performance

39
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,479
Danielle and her colleagues recently

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,340
published a systematic review of 20

41
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,319
studies that examined the next day

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,140
effects of THC

43
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,059
as the study States the length of time

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,460
an individual should wait following

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,520
cannabis use before performing safety

46
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,739
sensitive tasks is a critical issue

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,439
some government agencies and experts

48
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,140
recommend individuals avoid performing

49
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,840
safety sensitive tasks for at least 24

50
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,699
hours it should not surprise you to

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,219
learn that the data suggests a much

52
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:25,439
shorter impairment window during our

53
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,539
conversation we discuss the different

54
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,639
types of studies the authors reviewed

55
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,780
and the criteria they used to evaluate

56
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,000
them

57
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,500
the different tests administered to

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,318
measure impairment

59
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,939
how next day effects of THC compare to

60
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,098
the acute effects

61
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,378
how next day effects are different in

62
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:45,899
medicinal cannabis patients versus

63
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:48,179
recreational users

64
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,719
what methods are available to determine

65
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:55,439
THC impairment in drivers and what is

66
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,479
the reasonable impairment window for THC

67
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,519
before we get to my conversation with

68
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,000

89
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,519
good morning Danielle thanks so much for

90
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,519
joining me on the podcast

91
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,539
all right so you recently published are

92
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,878
you and your colleagues recently

93
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:18,120
published a review of studies that have

94
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,699
investigated the next day effects of THC

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,459
on cognitive function and safety

96
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,680
sensitive tasks which is a topic that

97
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,299
has implications on a number of

98
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,939
different policies which I'm sure we're

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,379
going to get into but first I'm curious

100
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,180
to learn a bit more about your

101
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:35,159
background and why you and your

102
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,759
colleagues were interested in studying

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,040
the next day effects of THC

104
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,720
but yeah so I'm a research fellow at the

105
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
Lambert Initiative for cannabinoid

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,900
Therapeutics which is a

107
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,799
philanthropically funded Center for

108
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,500
medicine

109
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,079
business research at the University of

110
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,939
Sydney and so the Lambert covers or

111
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,758
studies a whole wide range of different

112
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:58,918
areas related to cannabinoids but I

113
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,979
guess most of my research falls into the

114
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:04,978
sort of cannabis and driving domain so

115
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,839
um the effects of cannabis and THC use

116
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:10,978
is sort of a Hot Topic in that domain at

117
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:13,859
the moment hence our review

118
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:16,620
um yeah I think that's all I have to say

119
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,139
excellent so you mentioned cannabis and

120
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,300
driving which is certainly

121
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:25,379
um a Hot Topic

122
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,300
um so but again let's maybe not get into

123
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:28,860
that quite yet so

124
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,699
um let's let's talk about the result

125
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,160
results of your research so how many

126
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,080
different studies were you able to to

127
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,300
look at and what were sort of the the

128
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,300
main takeaways there

129
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,160
yeah so as you said our review looked at

130
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,259
the what we considered to be next day

131
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,740
effects of THC so basically we were

132
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:52,139
looking to identify any Interventional

133
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,079
studies so studies where either cannabis

134
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,280
or THC had been administered in some

135
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,779
form

136
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,299
um and their participants have been

137
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,758
required to undertake or perform some

138
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,978
kind of uh either simulated safety

139
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,259
sensitive tasks so things like driving

140
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:10,258
or there's some studies on simulated

141
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,259
airplane flying uh or some more sort of

142
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,580
standard and sort of common I guess

143
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:17,038
computerized cognitive tasks and there's

144
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,258
a wide variety of of those sorts of

145
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,180
activities and so to be included in the

146
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,939
review the studies had to have done this

147
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,620
and measured performance at least eight

148
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,319
hours following cannabis use because

149
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,759
that's sort of what we consider to be

150
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,479
um I guess your typical overnight

151
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,759
recovery period And so studies most of

152
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,159
them administered the tasks between sort

153
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,979
of 8 and 12 hours following cannabis use

154
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,840
and and some administered all the way

155
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:44,219
through

156
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,659
often they conducted testing at multiple

157
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,880
time points they might have measured it

158
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,720
12 hours and then 24 hours and sometimes

159
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:54,659
all the way up to 48 hours so we found a

160
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,580
total of 20 studies that had done this a

161
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,960
little published quite some time ago

162
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,978
there was a little bit of recent work

163
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,659
but largely historical and they measured

164
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:06,180
quite a number of different outcomes I

165
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,860
think it was several hundred uh

166
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,900
different sort of organist of sorry

167
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,520
several hundred different tasks and

168
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,099
that's across all the studies at all the

169
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,719
different time points and um under all

170
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,340
the different cannabis conditions so

171
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,860
often the studies would administer one

172
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,739
dose of THC on one study and our

173
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,800
different dose on or sorry one dose of

174
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,840
THC on one arm of one study and a

175
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,819
different dose a different arm in the

176
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,258
same study so you end up with like you

177
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,479
know the amount of data sort of just

178
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,800
increases exponentially as you start to

179
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:37,800
include these different arms and

180
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,220
different time points so yeah it turned

181
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,560
out to be a reasonably large undertaking

182
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,580
um but yeah that's what we included in

183
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,839
our review

184
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:51,478
okay and what were the results are were

185
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,719
you finding that people were impaired

186
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:57,060
after eight hours or or no

187
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,360
um so the vast majority of studies

188
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,699
showed no next day effects of THC so

189
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,720
that was across a variety of different

190
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,759
cognitive tasks and safety sensitive and

191
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,460
safety sensitive sorry simulated safety

192
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,500
sensitive tasks there were a small

193
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,579
number of studies that detected next day

194
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,139
effects

195
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,939
um but I guess an important element of

196
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,400
this review is not just to look at

197
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:23,519
quantity although they were overwhelming

198
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,739
majority showing no next AFX but also to

199
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,719
look at the quality of the studies and

200
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,639
what they're sort of showing and when we

201
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,158
looked closely at this sort of small

202
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,000
number of studies showing um subtle next

203
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,740
day effects they tended to be not such

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
good quality so

205
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,940
um none of them were randomized

206
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,459
controlled trials for example which is

207
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,040
our most rigorous form of Interventional

208
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:50,338
study and they often

209
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,899
um and they didn't tend to have the

210
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,700
um employ the best sort of

211
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,259
standardization procedures so what I

212
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,839
mean by about is we're really interested

213
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,139
in making sure that the studies we

214
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,120
um were sort of reading into used

215
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,580
um didn't allow their participants to

216
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,980
sort of consume alcohol 24 hours prior

217
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,660
to you know undertaking tasks caffeine

218
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,639
stay up all night all of those things

219
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,500
that can go on to affect cognitive

220
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,539
function we wanted to be sure that they

221
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,039
had been controlled out of the sort of

222
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,079
context so

223
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,699
um basically the gist is the studies

224
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,800
that did show next day effects which

225
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,800
there were very few of

226
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:28,500
um tended not to be great quality

227
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,599
um whilst there was a couple among those

228
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,240
showing sort of no next day effects that

229
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,940
were quite good quality so that seems to

230
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,820
be where the evidence is at the moment

231
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,660
yeah and I imagine they probably

232
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,839
established some some baseline

233
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:48,899
performance and did they also

234
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,940
study kind of acute facts effects of the

235
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,740
thc2 and compare those

236
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,980
that's a really good question so that

237
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,740
was another element of our review

238
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,000
so as you see say they admit or as I've

239
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,980
sort of said that when they've

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,620
administered their treatment cannabis or

241
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,360
THC or whatever they have chosen

242
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,159
um often they'll administer these

243
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,899
cognitive tasks or safety sensitive

244
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,120
tasks at several different time points

245
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,159
following use and whilst our next day

246
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,019
effects review was primarily interested

247
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,139
in those tasks administered more than

248
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:21,419
eight hours post THC use we did also for

249
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:23,159
all of the data that were available on

250
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,259
the more acute effects so if they

251
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,838
administered the same tasks one hour

252
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,299
later or two hours later where you you

253
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,519
know much more likely expect to see

254
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,199
impairment and the reason we did this

255
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,600
was because we wanted to know well okay

256
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,000
if we're showing no next day effects we

257
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,560
want to know if that's you know if the

258
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,879
studies have also seen acute effects

259
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,259
because if you haven't seen an acute

260
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,820
effect to your probability of seeing

261
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,179
your next Affair seems really really

262
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,100
sort of low so by collecting the sort of

263
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,719
acute data we were able to get a little

264
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,519
bit of insight into whether or not sort

265
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,800
of the doses being administered were

266
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,139
impairing to begin with and if the tasks

267
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,419
being used to assess impairment was

268
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,480
sensitive to begin with

269
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,399
um unfortunately we didn't get a lot of

270
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,079
uh

271
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,278
I guess there was quite a number of

272
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:12,359
tasks that didn't show or I guess um

273
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:14,939
quite a bit of

274
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,100
what would you say like our we found

275
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,540
that a lot of them didn't show acute

276
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,459
effects if that makes sense or either

277
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,399
didn't didn't show or didn't measure

278
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:26,159
acute effects but I think 20 of our

279
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,539
tasks of the tasks we identified I hope

280
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,039
that made sense that was a bit confusing

281
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:33,958
no no no it does and I know I and I

282
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,578
looked at the at the

283
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,439
um the study that you published too and

284
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,899
it looks like there were quite a bit of

285
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,180
different tests that were administered

286
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,879
to sort of measure this

287
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:46,439
um it looks like almost a dozen or so

288
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,259
um now

289
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,339
are some of these better indicators than

290
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,659
others

291
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,899
um what are your sort of your thoughts

292
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:53,899
there

293
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,739
um possibly yes I think uh there are

294
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,820
certain tasks that seem to stand out as

295
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,060
being

296
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,959
um better for identifying impairment I

297
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,739
think

298
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,419
um one of our probably preferred tasks

299
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,139
would be you know

300
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:14,759
um simulated driving because it's

301
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,019
an ecologically valid way in which to

302
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,458
look at impairment you're taking someone

303
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,078
and putting them in an activity that

304
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,819
they would typically

305
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:22,799
um or that you don't want to see them

306
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,700
impaired on and so actually using that

307
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,838
specific task is is kind of Ideal and

308
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,100
the main thing that we look at when

309
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,899
we're measuring

310
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,060
um sort of simulated driving performance

311
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,860
is a marker called standard deviation of

312
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,599
Lane position which is basically how

313
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,399
much lateral movement the vehicle makes

314
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,860
as it's moving along the road so sort of

315
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,980
swerving and that seems to be quite a

316
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,320
sensitive measure of impairments

317
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,259
um other than that in terms of the

318
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,120
computerized tasks one of the areas that

319
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:53,639
seems to show up quite a bit is

320
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,778
information processing speeds seems to

321
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,519
be quite heavily affected by THC and so

322
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,939
for example a task of information

323
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,320
processing speed might be something

324
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,459
one we use in the lab and I'll see if I

325
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,079
could explain it because it's always

326
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,699
hard to explain to even participants but

327
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,979
I'll see if I can make sense of it but

328
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,778
it's like a pattern generating task so

329
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,420
you see on the computer screen a series

330
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:16,919
of patterns and then the computer will

331
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,479
say okay I want you to produce pattern

332
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,278
one when you have to use the keyboard to

333
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,019
make that pattern and so you're sort of

334
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,939
identifying and then copying and

335
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,278
coordinating a few responses so that

336
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,260
tends to be reasonably sensitive

337
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,958
whereas kind of at the other end of the

338
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:34,078
spectrum our more sustained attention

339
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,759
type Focus tasks seem to show a little

340
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,559
bit less impairment

341
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,838
um but yeah it's hard to hard to compare

342
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,979
I mean the main thing when these kinds

343
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,779
of tasks is that the participants are

344
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,579
really thoroughly familiarized to them

345
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:48,078
otherwise you can kind of

346
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:50,879
um mask impairment with learning so uh

347
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,939
that's really really important

348
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,980
okay no in it's interesting you say

349
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,899
driving because that does seem to be you

350
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,240
know sort of one of the main problems

351
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,799
you're looking to solve for so

352
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
um going back to kind of at least

353
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,578
comparing the next day effects to the

354
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,880
acute effects what are you seeing in

355
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:10,559
terms of acute effects of THC on driving

356
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,919
performance

357
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,599
yeah so it seems to vary somewhat um

358
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,620
depending on the population that you're

359
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,320
studying

360
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,060
um the dose THC used and the root of

361
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,920
administration

362
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,739
um on average we would you know sort of

363
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,539
say that THC tends to be impairing uh in

364
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,299
the acute phase

365
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:32,278
um but uh we do note that regular

366
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:34,439
cannabis users seem to experience less

367
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:36,720
THC induced impairment than occasional

368
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,420
cannabis users likely due to the

369
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,480
development of Tolerance but also that

370
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:44,399
lower doses seem to produce less

371
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,139
impairment and the timing at which

372
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,480
impairment Peaks varies depending on

373
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:51,600
whether THC has been impaled which

374
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,579
usually right as quickly after whereas

375
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,040
orally ingested takes longer for that

376
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:58,439
impairment to sort of ensue

377
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:02,039
yeah and it's interesting you bring up

378
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,000
kind of inhaled versus Edibles too does

379
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,099
that

380
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,860
um is there a difference in the next day

381
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,120
effects of inhaled versus Edibles as

382
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,759
well because like you said it does take

383
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,778
longer to uh to kick in usually within

384
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,879
edible

385
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,578
that's right yeah

386
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,980
um so we've done a previous review

387
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:21,778
looking at the duration of impairment

388
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,940
that focused on the sort of less than

389
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:26,759
studies looking at the effects of THC

390
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,620
less than 12 hours following use and

391
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,259
when we conducted that review we did see

392
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,659
that oral THC induced in payment lasted

393
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,819
longer than inhales

394
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,458
um but the review predicted that the

395
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,639
impairment from orally administered sort

396
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:43,679
of THC would still subside within

397
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,139
um sort of about eight hours depending

398
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:49,559
on the dose provided that was with about

399
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,480
a 20 milligram oral dose

400
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,879
um looking at our current sort of next

401
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,940
day effects review we didn't sort of see

402
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:58,919
any patterns of you know studies that

403
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,720
administered THC orally being more

404
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,958
likely to detect impairment than those

405
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,579
that administered THC by inhalation and

406
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,399
it could just be because it was beyond

407
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:10,439
that eight hour window all of them were

408
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,620
relatively likely to be recovered within

409
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,959
that time so yeah no real patent emerged

410
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,459
the main sort of drivers into the

411
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,239
quality of the studies that we were

412
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:23,338
looking at to be honest interesting so

413
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,879
and I know in the paper you you had said

414
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:29,459
that you know whether it's some

415
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,100
um lawmakers or potentially employers

416
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,838
they sort of give some guidance of you

417
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,040
shouldn't be driving or operating heavy

418
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,720
machinery uh within 24 hours of uh using

419
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,120
cannabis but it seems like based on the

420
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,360
research that window is really eight

421
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,360
hours

422
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,600
seems to suggest

423
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:52,379
you know provided the doses you know

424
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,540
within reason right it becomes a little

425
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,879
bit more ambiguous

426
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:58,319
um but certainly 24 hours seems quite

427
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,078
conservative

428
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,439
um not a lot of data to support that as

429
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:06,178
far as we can find yeah yeah no and and

430
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,579
it's a good point too and I think one

431
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,959
that you brought up earlier is the

432
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:12,240
difference between a medical cannabis

433
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,759
user and a I guess an adult use

434
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,039
recreational user um one of them is

435
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:19,558
certainly looking for an altered effect

436
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,000
which would probably produce impairment

437
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,558
whereas the other one's looking for a

438
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,539
therapeutic effect which might be at a

439
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,699
lower dose

440
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:29,220
yeah that's a really important

441
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,000
so all of the research included in our

442
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,679
next day effects paper was based on

443
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,640
healthy individuals who use cannabis I

444
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,200
don't know some of them occasionally

445
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,120
some of them regularly little for

446
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,058
primarily sort of for recreational

447
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,619
purposes and that's just on the basis

448
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:46,619
that there was no studies looking at

449
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:48,839
medicinal cannabis users and that is

450
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:51,839
basically the picture across the driving

451
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,058
sort of space in cannabis and the

452
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,558
research area and driving in cannabis

453
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,440
and there's very little research looking

454
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,538
at medicinal cannabis users so as you

455
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,519
say that population could respond quite

456
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,379
differently you know when compared to

457
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,418
recreational users and medicinal

458
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,280
cannabis users are often you know

459
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,720
they're using the products on a very

460
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,579
regular basis so there's good

461
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,319
opportunity to develop tolerance to its

462
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:15,720
impairing effects they're typically

463
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:18,178
using lower doses to you know avoid

464
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,980
rather than induced intoxication and

465
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,140
they're also experiencing a clinical

466
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,179
benefit you know some improvement in

467
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,980
symptoms that might you know themselves

468
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:29,880
impaired driving so things like pain and

469
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,798
insomnia so it's definitely an area that

470
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,419
warrants for the sort of exploration and

471
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:34,440
something that we're very interested in

472
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,480
yeah

473
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,779
yeah and I know that um you know a

474
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,700
former a can Med uh presenter Dr Stacy

475
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:43,859
Gruber I know that she has done some

476
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,779
work in this in this area and she's even

477
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:48,719
demonstrated that some medical cannabis

478
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:52,379
users perform better in cognitive tests

479
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,538
after taking cannabis so there's a lot

480
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,820
of a lot of things going on here yeah

481
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:58,500
like I said really interesting area and

482
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,480
they could react quite differently so

483
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,240
I'm yeah not totally surprised by that

484
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,360
finding yeah very interesting yeah and

485
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,279
so it all comes back to this idea of

486
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,619
um I guess trying to keep impaired

487
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,319
drivers off the road and you know and it

488
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:16,439
seems that lawmakers or law enforcement

489
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:19,079
is really kind of fixated on on finding

490
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,660
a biomarker to kind of determine

491
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:24,119
cannabis impairment sort of like a blood

492
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,720
alcohol or breathalyzer

493
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,339
um

494
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,038
to your knowledge are there any

495
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,959
biomarkers that are reliable or that

496
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,240
were that were close on for determining

497
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,679
cannabis impairment or is that still a

498
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,380
bit of a Holy Grail

499
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:41,640
yeah like if you're talking biological

500
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:44,640
like in some kind of fluid biomarkers uh

501
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,259
at present no we just uh we don't really

502
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,960
have anything that's particularly good

503
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:51,599
so the most commonly looked at things uh

504
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,480
probably urine blood and oral fluid

505
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,219
urine um is probably the worst of the

506
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,440
lot we know that

507
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,480
um THC and it's metabolize

508
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,340
um things persist in urine for a really

509
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,740
really long time particularly among

510
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:06,298
regular users you know comfortably over

511
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,819
a month

512
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,558
um blood is is not particularly good

513
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,779
either it can hang around in blood for

514
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,000
extended periods of time and this is

515
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,980
largely because THC

516
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,079
um so it's a lipophilic molecule meaning

517
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,480
that it likes to get into fat and sort

518
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,279
of stay there so it accumulates in

519
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,839
people's fat stores and then just sort

520
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,720
of slowly leaches into blood meaning

521
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,879
that it can be there for again weeks and

522
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,819
sometimes longer after use

523
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,760
all fluid is a tricky Matrix

524
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:38,700
um it sort of has some benefits I guess

525
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,679
in that it is the Matrix that THC leaves

526
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,679
most rapidly

527
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,538
um so if you take someone who only very

528
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,000
occasionally uses cannabis and a

529
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:49,980
minister an acute dose you'll probably

530
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,259
find that it persists in all fluid for a

531
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,940
few hours and then dissipates

532
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,798
um which is kind of consistent with

533
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,779
impairment but there are a number of

534
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,220
kind of significant limitations aside

535
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:02,038
from that

536
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,980
um for example the first being that uh

537
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:07,679
so the only way that THC can end up in

538
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,259
oral fluid is if it enters a via direct

539
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,298
contact so you have to you know have a

540
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:14,400
smoked or you know ingested in some way

541
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:16,980
that it actually contacts the oral fluid

542
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,900
meaning that if you avoid that contact

543
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,640
say for example if the THC is

544
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,400
encapsulated

545
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,538
um You probably won't have any THC in

546
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,220
all fluid

547
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:28,558
um which means it's not a marker of

548
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,880
impairment at all the other factor is

549
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,940
that there's been really little research

550
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,600
research looking at Oral fluid THC

551
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,840
concentrations in regular cannabis uses

552
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,879
and what seems to be the case is that

553
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:44,099
whether THC is present in oral fluid and

554
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,840
regular cannabis uses is just a it's

555
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:47,579
completely variable sometimes it's there

556
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,158
12 hours later sometimes it's not

557
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:51,899
detected and it's just a little bit all

558
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,760
over the shop so

559
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,559
on the face of it there are some

560
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,179
advantages to that approach but when you

561
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:59,819
dig a Little Deeper it sort of falls

562
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,440
apart really quickly so yeah

563
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,178
um we don't currently have a

564
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,519
particularly good way of identifying

565
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:09,059
cannabis impaired drivers

566
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:12,720
now with something like a field sobriety

567
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:14,519
test be a good standard

568
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,900
yeah that's certainly the direction that

569
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,240
we're heading you know if you want to

570
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,980
measure or identify impairment the thing

571
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,740
that you maybe want to be looking for is

572
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,900
impairment um

573
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,159
tests are able to tell us the tricky

574
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,780
thing is

575
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,760
um identifying something that can be

576
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:33,119
carefully standardized across a lot of

577
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,819
people so for example you know if a

578
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,379
police officer asks people to stand on

579
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:39,538
one leg you know you're going to get

580
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,700
huge variations in how people are able

581
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:42,599
to do that and you know might depend on

582
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,279
you

583
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,439
um certain disabilities could affect it

584
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,538
and all kinds of different things

585
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,400
um even just age so

586
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:51,419
um you know that's not going to be you

587
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,798
can't stand there with a stopwatch

588
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,600
sometimes I want to go oh you know

589
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,639
you're impaired because you didn't stay

590
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:58,619
on your leg for as long as what is

591
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,320
typically average

592
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:03,779
um so we need to look for uh biology

593
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,839
sorry behavioral tests that

594
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:08,399
very sort of not very much from one

595
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,619
person to the next because we just don't

596
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,600
have a baseline measure or a drug-free

597
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:14,099
measure to compare against in the real

598
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,139
world

599
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:18,119
um in workplace settings where they

600
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,799
often also perform sort of drug testing

601
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,739
to screen out

602
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,940
um impairment uh Baseline measures may

603
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,099
be an option

604
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,558
um because people come back in every day

605
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:31,199
we can test them regulates that might be

606
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,298
a little bit of an easier uh sort of

607
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,319
question to answer but I do think we're

608
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:36,418
kind of heading in the right direction

609
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,339
with the behavioral tests and possibly

610
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:40,980
some combination of a behavioral and

611
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,720
biological test might give us kind of

612
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,759
the answer that we're looking for where

613
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,500
you know if you don't perform so well on

614
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,000
the behavioral test you're given the

615
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,740
drug test and you know you have to have

616
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,240
a look at the results of that but yeah

617
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,798
we'll just have to sort of see there's a

618
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,480
lot of interest in that area and a lot

619
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,679
of work being done so hopefully we can

620
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,019
find something

621
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,720
yeah and I have to imagine like you said

622
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:03,000
the the goal here is to keep impaired

623
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,419
drivers off the road regardless of if

624
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,599
it's cannabis or alcohol or uh opioids

625
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:11,880
or anything like that so having a a way

626
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,859
to identify impairment like again

627
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,799
regardless of the of the source is

628
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:19,619
really the goal exactly I mean fatigue

629
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,359
is a huge uh problem and we don't have a

630
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:24,058
biomarker for that so if it just so

631
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,798
happens that you know you can you know

632
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:27,359
pick that pick things like that up as

633
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,460
well and and discourage people from

634
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:33,058
driving just in general whilst impaired

635
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:35,759
that that would be great yeah yeah so

636
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:37,259
your findings being that

637
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,700
um we don't really have good evidence

638
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:42,179
that

639
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:44,880
cannabis users eight hours after after

640
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,620
using show any signs of impairment so

641
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,900
what sort of implications do those

642
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:51,000
results have on

643
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,460
um you know how employers set their drug

644
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,380
testing policies or even how patients or

645
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,640
clinicians

646
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:01,080
um either recommend cannabis or use it

647
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,280
um so in terms of patients and

648
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:07,079
clinicians I guess I mean ultimately how

649
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,079
um people take their medicine has to be

650
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,279
dictated by their clinical need

651
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,859
um but I guess what our research

652
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,440
suggests is that if they are using

653
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,899
um THC containing products in the

654
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,640
evening before bed which I think is

655
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,038
quite common for people with pain and

656
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,960
insomnia and things like that

657
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,720
um they should have relatively normal

658
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,519
function the next day

659
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,259
um whether or not that's something or a

660
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,019
factor that clinicians want to take into

661
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:37,079
account when prescribing or recommending

662
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:39,418
dosing regimes that's that discretion

663
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,918
but uh at least that's something that

664
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:43,200
they can use to inform their their

665
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,320
decision making hopefully

666
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,019
um in terms of policy for workplaces and

667
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,298
things like that I mean they face a very

668
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:53,158
similar problem to the roadside drug

669
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:54,359
testing where you know our research

670
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,000
would suggest that people who use

671
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:59,459
medicinal cannabis are relatively okay

672
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,659
to function the next day

673
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,159
um but they are still employing the

674
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:06,778
biomarkers that can produce positive

675
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,179
tests and we don't have a behavioral

676
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:11,400
alternative so it's a tricky thing to to

677
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:13,500
sort of work with I mean our data

678
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,419
suggests that if people are using their

679
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,859
medicinal product in the evening they

680
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:19,080
should be fine to function the next day

681
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:20,639
we'll see what they do with that

682
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,119
information

683
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,679
right and now you mentioned too that in

684
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,479
looking at the studies a lot of them

685
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,340
were maybe poorly designed or didn't

686
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,900
have proper controls and things like

687
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:32,519
that so I guess I'm going to put you a

688
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,000
little bit on the spot here but if you

689
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:38,879
were to design the perfect study

690
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,038
um what would that look like

691
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,039
oh tricky um yeah

692
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:47,879
a little bit on your manipulation so

693
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,380
maybe we'll start with

694
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,960
um you know healthy individuals who

695
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,220
might use cannabis recreationally I

696
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,778
think they were there were a couple of

697
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,360
quite good studies that our review

698
00:26:54,778 --> 00:27:00,119
identified in this space

699
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,379
um and uh I think a similar design to

700
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,678
what they've employed would be

701
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,720
appropriate we sort of I think you take

702
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,159
um your your population of healthy

703
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,720
individuals who use cannabis

704
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,760
occasionally

705
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,120
um allow them to

706
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,740
um consume cannabis probably as they

707
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,558
usually would

708
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,079
um sort of AD libidden in quantities

709
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:24,000
that

710
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:26,460
reflect their usual use

711
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,700
um and then keep them overnight in a

712
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:33,298
sleep lab or something like that and

713
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,058
then look at function the next day

714
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:37,740
um I think ideally I mean in a fictional

715
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:39,119
world you probably

716
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,278
um and I say fictional because in

717
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,558
Australia I'm not allowed to do this

718
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,980
um but you'd probably use an on-road

719
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:48,839
driving test to assess impairment and I

720
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,000
know that's something that their experts

721
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,639
at over in the Netherlands

722
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,519
um uh because it's you know super

723
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,500
ecologically valid and sensitive to

724
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,759
impairment and you know well researched

725
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
and things like that so that would be a

726
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,179
great way I think to look at next day

727
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,519
impairment

728
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,740
um and that overnight sort of component

729
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,480
ensures that participants aren't you

730
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,980
know out doing things that you don't

731
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,679
want them doing during that overnight

732
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,120
period continuing to use cannabis

733
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,220
um you know drinking alcohol staying up

734
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,778
all night all of those things can affect

735
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,480
the results of the study so I think that

736
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:23,640
would be one approach

737
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,000
I think the medicinal

738
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,460
um uses is a bit more complex to study

739
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,240
uh I think

740
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:36,419
I mean maybe ideally you'd take uh

741
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:40,319
people who were just initiating

742
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:42,840
um treatment uh and titrate them up to a

743
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,759
dose that they find efficacious whatever

744
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,220
that may be

745
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,440
um and then assess performance once

746
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,538
they're on that sort of Maintenance dose

747
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,580
um either you know 12 hours later or 12

748
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:55,859
hours following Placebo maybe you'd even

749
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:57,298
have a couple of arms um where people

750
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:00,599
weren't

751
00:28:57,298 --> 00:29:02,639
um sort of chronically treated

752
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,219
um initially put them on a placebo

753
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,559
titrate them up to a therapeutic dose

754
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,179
and then administered either THC and

755
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,460
Placebo and look at impairment so that

756
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:14,460
would be give you sort of four groups to

757
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,960
to compare but that one would be quite

758
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,840
the undertaking

759
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,840
um yeah need some funds to support that

760
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:21,839
absolutely

761
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,600
um and so I guess

762
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:30,119
there is a difference between measuring

763
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:33,480
impairment the following day and the the

764
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:34,619
quote-unquote Cannabis hangover

765
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,058
um

766
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:37,859
I imagine there's a difference there

767
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:39,538
right you could still feel some After

768
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,298
Effects the following day but it might

769
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:44,819
not necessarily be impaired impairing is

770
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:47,278
that fair to say yeah and this is why

771
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:49,558
we've used the phrase next day effects

772
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,599
throughout because it's really blurry as

773
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:53,099
to whether or not we're looking at you

774
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,278
know the

775
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:58,019
I guess tail end of impairment or if

776
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:01,619
we're looking at

777
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:03,119
um hangover kind of effects

778
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:06,479
um you know when you study alcohol

779
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,979
hangover you can you know administer a

780
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
dose of alcohol and then test that

781
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,579
someone has a breath alcohol

782
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,200
concentration of zero and you know that

783
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,879
okay we're no longer measuring the acute

784
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,200
effects of alcohol we're now measuring

785
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,299
the effects of the alcohol Handover

786
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,620
that's really blurry in the Cannabis

787
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:22,859
space

788
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:25,739
um so hence the term next day effects

789
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:27,298
interesting uh yeah

790
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,120
um so we can't

791
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:35,398
completely separate them but

792
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:37,558
um I know uh so one of the um excuse me

793
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,538
a postdoc here but uh at the time she

794
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:43,440
was a PhD student she recently completed

795
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:44,298
a RCT looking at

796
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,340
um

797
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:49,319
the uh I mean the primary aim of the the

798
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:51,720
trial was to look at the effects of THC

799
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:54,000
and insomnia or medicinal cannabinoids

800
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,500
and insomnia but she did look at the

801
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,619
sort of next day effects following

802
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,179
evening dosing and um I believe there

803
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:01,918
was a subtle effect

804
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,200
um for the treatment to increase next

805
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,640
day feelings of sedation which might

806
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,200
kind of capture some of those measures

807
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,419
you're talking about but interestingly

808
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,159
when they administered the

809
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:13,140
um what's called the maintenance of

810
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,000
wakefulness test which is the most

811
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,799
boring task that you can ever administer

812
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,898
basically participants have to stare at

813
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,158
a wall for 45 minutes and try not to

814
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:21,898
fall asleep

815
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,240
um they did that several times the next

816
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:26,038
day there's four participants and it's

817
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,200
considered sort of the most

818
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,720
um or it's considered an objective

819
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,240
measure of next day alertness or things

820
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,700
like that and so despite having that

821
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,380
subtle increase in sedation maybe that

822
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,058
was the wrong thing that that was sort

823
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,840
of what they reported

824
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:41,940
um

825
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,339
they didn't detect any effects on the

826
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,080
maintenance of wakefulness test so um

827
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:50,158
you could be right where you can feel

828
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:52,678
possibly not 100 but still be functional

829
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,720
if that makes sense yeah yeah that it's

830
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,700
actually that's actually interesting and

831
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,038
it goes in line with the what we were

832
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,798
talking about with fatigue being

833
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,019
um a problem with driving performance

834
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:05,879
um so that you know even if you weren't

835
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:08,099
under the acute effects of cannabis but

836
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,539
you were fatigued as a result that would

837
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:11,278
be an issue too but it sounds like

838
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:13,019
that's that's not the case they can

839
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,839
stare at the wall for 45 minutes and not

840
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:18,798
fall asleep yeah I mean that was a good

841
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,798
night's sleep maybe I'll

842
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,259
probably yeah I shouldn't share too much

843
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:26,819
but yeah really interesting findings

844
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:29,038
there and that's that's still to come

845
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,759
excellent well speaking of things to

846
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:32,220
come

847
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,960
um I'm curious um what research you're

848
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,240
you're working on now and what we can

849
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,740
expect to see

850
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,480
oh

851
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,159
um so a few different things but I guess

852
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,140
the overall theme is that we're

853
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,140
interested in moving into the you know

854
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,659
medicinal cannabis user sort of space

855
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,000
um within the context of of driving and

856
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:53,159
safety sensitive tasks so

857
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,200
um as you've said that's this issue of

858
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,760
you know biomarkers of impairment how do

859
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,798
we identify

860
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,720
um uh that on the roads so that's

861
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,158
something that we're interested in we're

862
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,500
also interested in you know whether

863
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,120
medicinal candidates are users are in

864
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,099
fact impaired

865
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,959
um when they use their treatment

866
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,359
um as instructed under you know careful

867
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,038
medical supervision so that's something

868
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,479
that we would like to investigate

869
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,640
further

870
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,819
um and yeah that's probably the main

871
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,778
sort of things at the moment so before I

872
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,038
let you go

873
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:25,798
um I wanted to give you the opportunity

874
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,240
to share any other resources that are

875
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:28,740
sort of related to the topics that we

876
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,298
talked about and I'll be happy to put

877
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,120
them in the show notes for people to

878
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:34,440
learn more or if there's a website or

879
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:39,058
any way to get in touch with you if

880
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,380
people want to connect please plug away

881
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:43,079
oh

882
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,720
um I guess we have the Lambert

883
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:47,819
initiative website so I'm sure if um

884
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,558
people go to Google and type in labid

885
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:51,599
initiatives they'll be able to find that

886
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:53,579
and that should link people to our

887
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,439
ongoing clinical trials

888
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:57,658
um probably our sort of Twitter page I

889
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,480
know that that's quite um active at the

890
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,640
moment uh and should allow you to get in

891
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,380
touch with any of the researchers at the

892
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,080
Lambert initiative that you might like

893
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,139
to speak to so that's probably a good

894
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,579
point that's cool yeah excellent yeah

895
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,440
and I'm definitely going to put a link

896
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:16,619
to the study in the show notes so people

897
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,480
can can dig into the data all right

898
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:21,480
