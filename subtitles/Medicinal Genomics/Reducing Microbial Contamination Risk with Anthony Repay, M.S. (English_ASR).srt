several Nationwide cannabis groups

67
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,060
during our conversation we discuss how

68
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:06,179
Growers can incorporate microbial

69
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,280
testing into their processes sources of

70
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,360
microbial contamination and tips for

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,759
prevention

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,239
how differences in microbial regulations

73
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,699
influence growers in certain States

74
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,739
remediation Technologies and more

98
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,619
good afternoon Anthony thanks so much

99
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,180
for joining us on the podcast

100
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,060
absolutely thank you thank you for

101
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,100
having me of course so I'm excited to

102
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,139
talk with you today about a topic that's

103
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,180
near and dear to our hearts here at

104
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,759
medicinal genomics and that's microbial

105
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,319
testing as you might expect us being one

106
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,660
of the most widely used cannabis

107
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,000
microbial testing platforms it's a topic

108
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,160
we've explored before in Prior episodes

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,839
we've talked about the value of

110
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,600
microbial testing when it comes to

111
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,159
patient and consumer safety and we've

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,020
talked with laboratory professionals

113
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,680
like yourself about some of the

114
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:16,079
differences in Tech testing techniques

115
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,600
which I know that are topics that you're

116
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,399
well qualified to address but today I'm

117
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,919
interested in talking with you about the

118
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,918
Growers perspective mainly what should

119
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,959
Growers know about microbial testing and

120
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,399
perhaps most importantly what are things

121
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,339
that they can do to reduce their

122
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,799
microbial contamination risk so to start

123
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:37,138
us off I'd like to ask you in your

124
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,900
experience How concerned are Growers

125
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,538
with microbial testing and where does it

126
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,758
rank on their list of concerns

127
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:47,038
that's a great question so

128
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,439
um honestly I believe it's it's one of

129
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,579
the most talked about if not the most

130
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,978
talked about

131
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:55,379
um subject at least in the Grower's

132
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:58,019
perspective and you know we we have

133
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:00,120
these issues where microbials

134
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,339
um they're not seen um I mean obviously

135
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,680
we have some you know powdery mildew and

136
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,299
we have visible mold growth um botrytus

137
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,100
and all you know all of these different

138
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,259
things that are visible but when it when

139
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,280
it comes to generic

140
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:16,439
um microbial it's hard to detect

141
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,579
um I think of you know I sub-categorize

142
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,100
different things between you know

143
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:22,258
chemistry and and microbiology

144
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,180
um in most Laboratories

145
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,520
um pretty have a pretty robust chemistry

146
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,199
Department that will allow them to do

147
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,418
pesticide screening you know heavy metal

148
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,280
screening things that can cause

149
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:34,099
compliance failures

150
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,019
um whereas in the microbial side

151
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,960
unfortunately it often happens where you

152
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:42,299
you don't see it until it's kind of too

153
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,038
late and that's where I I feel like you

154
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,259
know the the environmental monitoring

155
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:47,939
aspect of it all is very important um

156
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,160
but it definitely is it's a question

157
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:53,100
that I get

158
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,340
often maybe two to three times a week is

159
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,919
hey you know I I'm failing for this

160
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,739
um what's going on and and how can I fix

161
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,959
this and it just kind of it I know it's

162
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,500
on everybody's radar especially as we

163
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,959
look at different states and we look at

164
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,879
different multi-state operations that

165
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,138
they're trying to bring a cookie cutter

166
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,259
approach

167
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,418
to to different states so like for

168
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,520
instance if we look at um so previous to

169
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:22,079
my tenure ship came from Nevada

170
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,719
um and so we have a whole different

171
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,818
experience or threshold testing and

172
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,560
present absent testing that that goes

173
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,660
into the Nevada regulations whereas

174
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,639
currently I reside in Florida and do

175
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,380
compliance testing in Florida

176
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,759
um and we have a I wouldn't say

177
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,500
completely different

178
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,379
um but we we do have less things to test

179
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,259
for for instance in Nevada we're testing

180
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,459
for enterobacteria total coliform

181
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,939
analysis

182
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,560
and then floor for threshold testing and

183
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,598
um your present absence are you know

184
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,060
based basically the same

185
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,159
um and and in Florida we're generically

186
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,680
just testing for um total yeast and mold

187
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,560
so as we as we bring these cookie cutter

188
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,098
approaches to different uh mmtcs or

189
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:09,000
different places it can struggle

190
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:12,959
um and and the best I can say is is

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,819
keeping a good clean operation is is the

192
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,318
is my first approach

193
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,639
um and you'd be shocked when you go into

194
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,240
some of these places

195
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:24,418
um and and you see uh what what is going

196
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,098
and and I I think back to

197
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:28,258
um you know previous places that I I've

198
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,959
had where I was I was visiting and of

199
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,820
course I can't say any names but uh and

200
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,500
I don't know if I can even say it on

201
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,120
your podcast but um

202
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,940
I think I think back to different places

203
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,879
I've toured and um we're failing for

204
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,919
mold and I'm like oh okay yeah let's

205
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,019
figure this out and can I come on site

206
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,240
and of course I come on site and I'm

207
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:50,699
like well you have standing water with

208
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,440
with mold on top of it and they're like

209
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,660
well yeah yeah yeah yeah that and I'm

210
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,640
like well you know that if it's in your

211
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,740
your facility as a whole

212
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,720
um it's very easy to get trapped into

213
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,120
the grows and and

214
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,980
just it needs to be clean from front to

215
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,060
step yeah you know from front of the

216
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,440
house to the back of the house and

217
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,299
that's the cleanliness is the first

218
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,700
place that I start with

219
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,740
um and that's that's just how it how it

220
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,420
should be I mean if we think of these

221
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,700
like I mean this is this people's

222
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,979
medicine not only that is it's a it's a

223
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,100
plant so not only do you have the um the

224
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,379
botany approach to to keeping things

225
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,240
um controlled and aseptic and and clean

226
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,860
but you also have that this should be

227
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,480
also as clean as a medical grade

228
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,700
facility

229
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,440
um and it should be treated like that

230
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,940
um and so that it definitely is one of

231
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,959
the the larger questions that I hear

232
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,760
from

233
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,338
no and that's a great point when you

234
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,360
talk about microbial it's it's hidden it

235
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,300
can't be seen

236
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,940
and I think with a lot of you mentioned

237
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,620
powdery mildew and now hoplet and viroid

238
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,180
is another thing that's hot on

239
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,860
everyone's mind those are things that

240
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,479
are actually affecting the health of the

241
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,600
plant right so that's something that can

242
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,100
be sort of apparent to a grower but I

243
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,080
would imagine that in a lot of cases

244
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,940
Growers don't really know that they have

245
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,820
a problem with microbial contamination

246
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,440
until they send a sample to Labs like

247
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,500
yourself and they get the results back

248
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,240
is that right that that's pretty correct

249
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,100
um and and that's where so like each

250
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,139
state again is different

251
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,980
um so in Florida for instance we have a

252
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:22,139
pretty heavy r d side of testing so that

253
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,580
being said uh when samples are submitted

254
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,159
they're more often than not they're

255
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,019
submitted for r d testing first before

256
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,600
they're packaged and then because we do

257
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,220
Post package testing here in Florida

258
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,080
um so they do you know r d testing

259
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,000
screen it for their their pathogens

260
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,519
their their microbes that could be

261
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,720
failing and then when they package it

262
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,278
um and then you get the compliance

263
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,620
testing so you're kind of doing it twice

264
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,659
to confirm on the front at um so they

265
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,459
would see it on that r d side so that

266
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:49,019
they can do some remediation

267
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,059
um and anything along those lines and

268
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,620
then but then on the packaging side is

269
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,719
when things get difficult where you have

270
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,740
compliance failures

271
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,139
um and then you know those are very

272
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,820
costly from not only from from a

273
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,458
Grower's standpoint but from just trying

274
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,339
to figure out what what happened

275
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:07,979
um and then yeah that I mean the the

276
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:10,500
question I guess the key of it all is

277
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,278
that um I mean test test early and test

278
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:17,278
often right is is don't be I it it is

279
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,899
costly and I understand that and you you

280
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,820
have different Avenues to kind of do

281
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,440
things here as you can do you know

282
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,959
in-house screening you could do you know

283
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,940
uh submitting r d samples to a um a

284
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,619
third-party testing to do um out of

285
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,459
house testing to just kind of screen for

286
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,560
these

287
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,299
um to monitor where it comes it also

288
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,979
comes in

289
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,539
um how you mentioned how like you don't

290
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,539
really know if you have a problem until

291
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:42,539
you have a problem uh it it depends on

292
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,559
how your grow is set up truly and you

293
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,179
know I've been to several different

294
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,139
grows now where

295
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,319
um some of them are very

296
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:51,659
compartmentalized where the grow tables

297
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,420
are actually um in for for your guys's

298
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:57,059
visual reference it is um it was an old

299
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:58,860
like storage unit facility

300
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:02,338
um so they would they converted they can

301
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,440
like these large multi-room grows it was

302
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,540
really really cool

303
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,740
um uh and so like from a microbial

304
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,620
standpoint it made me really happy

305
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,480
because these rooms were segregated to a

306
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,339
fact that you know this was this one

307
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,259
they had dedicated ventilation no

308
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,839
crossover the only way that microbe

309
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,299
could get in was through the door or

310
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,279
from person to person transfer

311
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:25,500
um and so from those instances you can

312
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,500
kind of subject it and kind of look at

313
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,899
the results and okay so room 12 has been

314
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,879
failing uh We've failed you know 10 of

315
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,679
our last 20 Lots out of room 12. what

316
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,299
are we doing in room 12 and that's where

317
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,799
your remediation steps come in so when

318
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,439
the room comes down you go through your

319
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:43,019
drawback drying process are you cleaning

320
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,899
properly air ducts are we are we

321
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,220
cleaning the ducts all the way properly

322
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,958
what are these next steps to make sure

323
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,519
that that next grow that next Harvest

324
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,078
that goes into that room is also not

325
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,459
contaminated

326
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:54,778
um and on the on the other side the flip

327
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,059
side of it

328
00:12:54,778 --> 00:13:00,958
um I've seen grows where they're giant

329
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:05,119
facilities uh just one giant room full

330
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:07,799
of of marijuana and you know each table

331
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,860
is you know is is that you know table

332
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,659
one table two table three and

333
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,720
you know if that's the case if you're

334
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,578
having a trouble in that one room uh you

335
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,459
you could cost you your whole grow at

336
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:23,879
that point um so it's it's best to find

337
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:26,039
a way to kind of separate and then you

338
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,980
know eat treat each table or treat each

339
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,958
room as its own separate entity so that

340
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,560
you know for instance

341
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,599
um

342
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:36,778
when you know it when it comes to

343
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,620
strains too so like some strains seem to

344
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:42,958
have a denser you know a more robust I

345
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,820
guess bud would be the term I would use

346
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,379
um and then some are not as big you know

347
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,300
they they tend to grow you know smaller

348
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,620
Buds and in treating each one of those

349
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:52,199
different with the light cycles and the

350
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:55,078
cleaning Cycles is just important

351
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,079
yeah no and you make a good point of

352
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:01,379
test early and test often so

353
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,659
how early and how often I mean is or is

354
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:05,939
it throughout the plants sort of life

355
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:08,639
cycle or is that sort of just taken as

356
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,100
you know one point in time and then it's

357
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,440
the processing the drying the curing or

358
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,959
or is it all the above so like how how

359
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,740
often should they be testing absolutely

360
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,179
um

361
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,860
uh so this is again from the

362
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,379
microbiologist perspective and of course

363
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,659
from the third party Labs perspective uh

364
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:28,100
so take that into account but also uh

365
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:28,100
more testing is also it's my

366
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,838
tenure ship we had

367
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,940
it that would as soon as those those

368
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,339
plants were propagated or excuse me as

369
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,160
soon as they were grown we would then

370
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:43,079
first give them viral screening okay so

371
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:44,939
they were in this quarantine State we

372
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:46,198
did viral screening on these um to

373
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,079
confirm that we did not have any

374
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,519
oblating virus was his uh bread and

375
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:52,439
butter he didn't like that he had a pre

376
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,480
in a previous job he had it and so you

377
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,800
know you get burned from it once so we

378
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,379
did the Hop late night

379
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:01,740
um in the early screening and then we

380
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:04,379
did a um just generic environmental

381
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,879
screening so so speaking of like state

382
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:07,620
to state and how often do you screen

383
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,439
some states differ in the way that their

384
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,019
r d processes are allowed for for

385
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,720
instance so you you need to find ways to

386
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,339
get a representation of what that sample

387
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,040
um could give you on a microbial

388
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,660
standpoint by testing the environment

389
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:23,099
um around it and so quite frankly by

390
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,559
putting in a robust environmental

391
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,360
monitoring program will allow you to

392
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,698
just kind of get a nice general idea of

393
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,579
how your facility is doing but also the

394
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:34,379
idea of how that room or that grow is

395
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:37,019
doing specifically

396
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:39,059
um and the easiest way to do this is to

397
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,039
do zoning techniques

398
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:43,198
um so this is pretty um good lab

399
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,179
practice but also pretty pretty normal

400
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,278
in your routine grows when it comes to

401
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:49,919
like lettuce testing tomato testing but

402
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,620
and then also food testing as well is

403
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,778
setting up a Zone network of how often

404
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,940
do things come into contact

405
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:58,139
um so obviously you're trimming scissors

406
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,019
your

407
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,360
um your tables your lines your front

408
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:06,240
lines your Ro tanks all of those things

409
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,120
impact your production every single day

410
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,759
those should be tested more frequent

411
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,159
than the things that attack that affect

412
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,860
your samples on a weekly or a monthly

413
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:20,278
basis so when I when working with

414
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,259
quality departments at grows we first

415
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,620
develop a list and then we those out you

416
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,720
know so your Zone one is your everyday

417
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,639
and your zone four is are things that

418
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,139
you know okay we use that once or twice

419
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,940
you know I had to grow that you know

420
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,860
barely did pre-rolls we barely use the

421
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,720
pre-rolled machine so okay so we're

422
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,159
gonna put that in zone four

423
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,839
um if we're barely using this uh the

424
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,759
pre-roll machine let's put that in zone

425
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,160
one but we're always doing fresh flour

426
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,019
Okay cool so let's put the trimming

427
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,059
scissors in the trimming table on Zone

428
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,639
one and the frequency at which we test

429
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:52,138
those should be reflected upon that um

430
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,360
and to give you a good idea not only

431
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,120
that setting up a Zone in a grid like

432
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,399
pattern for your actual grow facility

433
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,860
and what I mean by that

434
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,380
is

435
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,838
microbials tend to interact in in

436
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,179
conditions that are favorable for them

437
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:10,619
so that being said you can use indicator

438
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,179
organisms

439
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:15,479
um so like your total yeast and mold

440
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:17,400
your inner bacteria your total coliform

441
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,419
um to get a general idea of the

442
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,059
cleanliness and and how your flower will

443
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,740
perform on a microbial standpoint so

444
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:28,318
let's you know the hot topic for at

445
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,000
least in in Florida and for everybody is

446
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,519
you know it's total yeast in mold and

447
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,839
aspergillus everybody Everyone likes to

448
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,879
talk about aspergillus Everyone likes to

449
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,019
talk about total yeast and all so let's

450
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,799
talk about it

451
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,900
um

452
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,000
total aspergillus I'm just gonna you

453
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,860
know not make any headlines here but

454
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
aspergillus is a mold

455
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:50,399
awesome uh so it will be encompassed in

456
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,058
a total yeast and mold test

457
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,519
so that being said by doing generic

458
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,079
total yeast and mold analysis on

459
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,660
different areas in your grid like

460
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,699
pattern in your facility you can then

461
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,340
kind of think How likely will

462
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,319
aspergillus grow in these conditions

463
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:10,379
because they're more favorable to grow

464
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:12,839
in things that are favorable to them so

465
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,760
setting up uh so like for instance when

466
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,619
I would go into when I talked earlier

467
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,440
about the um the cultivation that was

468
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:22,139
from a kind of like an old um storage

469
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,179
unit facility and so I treated every

470
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,880
room in a grid like pattern so I would

471
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:30,179
go you know front middle back

472
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,500
side side and what we would find is that

473
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,600
there was not a lot of light that was

474
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,720
growing in the the back left Corners

475
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,699
this often yield had been popped high on

476
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,679
my total yeast and mold environmental

477
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,360
tests and they're also feeling for a lot

478
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,700
of yeast and mold so as long as we're

479
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:47,819
focusing the clean on those hot spots

480
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,259
that we know tend to grow that total

481
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,119
yeast and mold

482
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,038
um they they you're gonna cut down on

483
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,538
your failures or at least try to cut

484
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,940
down on your failures and then what I

485
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:59,279
say is okay we find the hot spots

486
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,900
um I throw a large net into the sea we

487
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,639
find the hot spots we find what works

488
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,160
and then you start to go there I come in

489
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,840
for a retest we test those spots to make

490
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,419
sure that your cleaning analysis is

491
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:11,399
actually sufficient

492
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,160
um and then we do it again and we find a

493
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,660
new Hot Spot and we do that and so we

494
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,519
don't find hot spots but we just find

495
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,440
what I call like warm spots things that

496
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,259
we should be kind of

497
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,720
either on my radar but um they may or

498
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,279
may not be causing failures

499
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,500
um and then when we move on that we just

500
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,119
know what the best lab practices are or

501
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,759
examine what the best cleaning practices

502
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,379
are for that specific facility and

503
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:36,240
they're all different

504
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,120
um you know it I just think back to like

505
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,058
Nevada and even here in Florida it's um

506
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,759
they're all different and you know you

507
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:46,740
may find buildings that are um you know

508
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,200
transformed from a different purpose or

509
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,339
some that are built out specifically for

510
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,679
that purpose

511
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:55,019
um and they're all the the ways of

512
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,640
remediation and the ways of combating

513
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:58,379
this microbial

514
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,780
um is all different

515
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,200
yeah and I think those are two wildly

516
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:05,819
different climates too right Nevada

517
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,380
yes they are

518
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,259
um and and that's where I think you know

519
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,000
the threshold testings are are different

520
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:13,740
um so like for instance when you when

521
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,839
you talk about Nevada

522
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,960
um the for for flower

523
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,418
um the failure limit is 10 000 cfu when

524
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,400
you're talking Florida you're talking 10

525
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,799
000 cfu and then when you when you think

526
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,740
of like Illinois the threshold is 1000

527
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:31,379
cfu right and those are those three are

528
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,558
I guess and uh as a previous resident of

529
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:37,080
Illinois but uh the those are three

530
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,599
radically different climates

531
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,399
um that that you know you have to be

532
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,939
playful to the environment that which is

533
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:48,298
that your samples are subjected to

534
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,058
yeah and then I have to imagine that

535
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:52,798
having such widely different thresholds

536
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:54,538
for The Growers I mean those are going

537
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,480
to be I mean if you're looking at

538
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:59,519
Illinois for example that 100 that 1 000

539
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,640
cfu threshold is going to be pretty

540
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,859
difficult to be no right right yeah it's

541
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,080
uh yeah it's definitely it and so you're

542
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:09,178
going to see a lot more indoor growth

543
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:12,000
um because it's more favorable to

544
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,620
um climates that they can control

545
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,440
um and also it snows there and that's

546
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:18,959
why I keep moving away from it but uh

547
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,740
the it's you gotta you have to make sure

548
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,640
that when in those more rigid testing

549
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,279
facilities or or states that um

550
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,980
more is in your control to the best of

551
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:35,099
your ability and now that also comes

552
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,500
with a double-edged sword because it's

553
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:40,139
much harder to get rid of a microbial

554
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,140
contamination in an indoor facility

555
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,940
because it gets stuck it in the you know

556
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,919
in the in the

557
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,500
the HVAC systems and the different

558
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,640
systems that are just built into those

559
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,579
facilities

560
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,400
right so going back to this whole idea

561
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,960
of testing early testing often and it

562
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,298
sounds like from the examples you

563
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,279
provided you're not testing the actual

564
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:05,038
plants you're more testing the

565
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,779
environment is that correct now you can

566
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,819
um there's two ways of doing it

567
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:12,000
um so like what I would recommend so it

568
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:13,619
you're kind of at the um

569
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,359
you're you're kind of at the mercy of

570
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:16,678
what the the requirements are for the

571
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,959
state to state

572
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,360
um so like how rigid is the r d process

573
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,720
so for instance like for Nevada

574
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,939
um for for r d testing to to be even

575
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,140
submitted to a state or to a compliance

576
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,058
Laboratory

577
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,640
um written approval must be sent in to

578
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:35,099
the board uh and then for instance and

579
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,360
then in Florida it's very common I get r

580
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:38,759
d samples and I get the compliance

581
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,439
samples it's just how it works

582
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,779
um and so each state is just different

583
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,558
so for instance if if you're in a state

584
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:50,038
that heavily is allowance of r d testing

585
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,379
then I would say let's do the plan let's

586
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:55,140
see how the plant is is interacting with

587
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,280
its surroundings uh throughout its life

588
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,559
cycle

589
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,178
um and then it's great to have a great

590
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,220
environmental monitoring program on top

591
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,100
of that because you can also save on

592
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,500
sending me samples but if you're in a

593
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:09,959
more rigid environment where and neither

594
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,519
one is right or wrong but um

595
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,980
if you're in a more rigid environment

596
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,940
where r d testing is maybe a little bit

597
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,400
more

598
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,679
um hard to come by is the is the phrase

599
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,559
I'd say then environmental monitoring is

600
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,538
is maybe your only choice and and that's

601
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,460
where you need to get the vast amount of

602
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:28,919
your data at

603
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,720
okay and so I'm gonna throw an example

604
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,480
at you so say I'm testing the plant

605
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,298
itself I'm a few weeks away still from

606
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,940
Harvest and we've identified a

607
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:41,339
contamination issue kind of what are the

608
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,380
steps that they can take to sort of

609
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,720
reduce that microbial load potentially

610
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,120
on the plant and and you know get a a

611
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,058
passing grade

612
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:52,199
so oh man that's a that's a tough one

613
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:54,599
um I know that there are several

614
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,700
different like kind of remediation steps

615
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,399
um out there that take place

616
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,319
um when often I think about is like the

617
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,820
radiation that you can subject your

618
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,339
plant to

619
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:08,519
um and and that that can you know first

620
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:11,099
kill off any Target microbes

621
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,900
um from that instance there's also ozone

622
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,519
radio uh okay I said almost a ozone

623
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,679
radiation but

624
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,720
uh there's off there's oh there's also

625
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:22,440
um ozone that can be subjected onto the

626
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,620
the plant itself uh in a drying phase uh

627
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,960
and so there are ways to kind of um when

628
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:30,418
you're at that last level where you've

629
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,440
kind of like we need to to find a

630
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,080
solution

631
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,279
um the I guess the the ultimate thing is

632
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,798
if you get a failing you could always

633
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,178
turn it into an extraction right um and

634
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:41,579
that and that is the nice thing about

635
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:43,620
cannabis is that there's there is like

636
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,538
waste the waste of the actual plant can

637
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:48,418
be used and utilized into a different

638
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:49,980
form of product for the patients

639
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,919
right no and I wanted to get your

640
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,259
thoughts sort of on a radiation and uh

641
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,100
some of these sterilization techniques

642
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:58,440
um

643
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,859
how does it affect the the quality of

644
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,860
the product

645
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,880
okay

646
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,500
um but I mean when it comes to quality

647
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,080
of the product I can uh I don't know

648
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,579
where you want to cut that but um

649
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,720
I don't know too much about it to be

650
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:15,119
completely honest with you I've heard

651
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,700
multiple things where

652
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,859
um yeah it depends who you talk to to be

653
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,600
completely honest with you

654
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:23,699
and being in the third party testing

655
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,859
facility um I don't I don't get too much

656
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,080
in the weeds of that when it comes to

657
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,798
when it comes to um the effect of the

658
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,199
flower

659
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,879
um but you know you you think you know I

660
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,740
hear some people that are very purists

661
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,080
that are like it it affects the terpenes

662
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,159
and it affects the um the potency of it

663
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,619
and then you hear the people that

664
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,419
heavily rely on these radiation or these

665
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:44,099
um sterilization or remediation uh

666
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,240
methods and they say it doesn't do

667
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:47,819
anything

668
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,038
um as a third party testing facility

669
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:53,519
um it I have not done enough research to

670
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:56,278
kind of like give my say on it um so it

671
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,440
really depends on on who you talk to and

672
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:59,700
uh what what they have to say about it

673
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,519
but that would be something interesting

674
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,278
to see I know that each company

675
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:08,339
um has done their own and their their

676
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,558
own may be you know if let's just say

677
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:12,058
like um you know a radiation person may

678
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,038
be saying well this is what ozone does

679
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:16,139
and then ozone says no but we don't do

680
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,599
that but this is what radiation does

681
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,220
um and then you're kind of like well

682
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,740
I don't know

683
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,538
um it's kind of double edged on that

684
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,319
sure sure

685
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:26,640
um

686
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,918
I wanted to go back to talking about

687
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,299
kind of cleaning up the hot spots that

688
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,460
you were talking about when you identify

689
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:35,278
them in a facility so what are the best

690
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,720
methods for doing that like is it using

691
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,900
a bleach solution are there other

692
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,819
methods like right

693
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,340
uh one of the things that I recommend is

694
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:46,619
always like a 10 belief solution

695
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,538
um not only do you you get rid of a lot

696
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:50,819
of like if you're if you so if you have

697
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:52,500
a microbial lab not only do you get rid

698
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,418
of the amplicons uh and the different

699
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,880
kind of uh microbial mess that can be

700
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,140
can be harming you on that

701
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,059
um but it's also a great way to just

702
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,559
kind of sterilizing and kind of clean

703
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:03,839
your room

704
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:06,298
um so like I know that people do so like

705
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,980
for instance the I've seen Labs or

706
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:09,960
excuse me I've seen grows that have done

707
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,339
like a UV light treatment and then

708
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,380
they've gone in after that they've done

709
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:15,000
an overnight UV light treatment and then

710
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,159
they go around and then they do an ozone

711
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,140
bomb and then then they'll come in and

712
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,240
then they'll wear you know masks and

713
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,620
they'll do a 10 bleach kind of soap of

714
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,599
the wall they'll clean the whole

715
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:26,699
facility and then they'll let it dry and

716
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:28,798
then it's ready to rock and roll

717
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,120
um and so that's that in my opinion is

718
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:34,619
you know you're going above and beyond

719
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:36,538
but your fail rate's low uh so is is as

720
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,639
long as the ends justify the means

721
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:40,740
um that's that's what I would say

722
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,179
um so for sure making sure that you have

723
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,919
cleaners

724
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,720
um 10 bleach is what I always recommend

725
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,000
for my uh

726
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,860
girl right and so you're saying too that

727
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,298
you know once you're when you're turning

728
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:53,519
over a room once you've done a harvest

729
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:54,778
and cleaned everything out do it do a

730
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,778
good sterilization before you're

731
00:27:54,778 --> 00:28:00,000
introducing new plants absolutely

732
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:01,919
um and you'd be surprised with like like

733
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,720
what can be left on those walls and what

734
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,460
can be left on the ceilings and you know

735
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,960
in the hvacs and the um especially in

736
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,759
the dry rooms

737
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,679
um in the dry rooms you're not only you

738
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,900
know in some cases you have a humidifier

739
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,820
some cases you have a dehume

740
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,820
um they're trying to cure the product

741
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:20,158
while having a heavily ventilated area

742
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:22,918
um the cross-contamination can be can be

743
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,500
massive so making sure you're you're

744
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,179
also turning over those rooms equally as

745
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,558
well as you do your actual grow

746
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,600
facilities

747
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,298
yeah and that's a great Point are there

748
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,939
are there environmental conditions that

749
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:38,339
Growers should kind of strive for to

750
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,840
kind of create an environment that's not

751
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:42,959
so

752
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,879
um hospitable for microbial growth or is

753
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,340
it sort of hard to do that when you're

754
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,200
dealing with an organic plant it is very

755
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:50,699
hard to do with that in an organic plant

756
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,558
because you know at the end of the day

757
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,679
we need to think about we are growing a

758
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,058
plant yeah um and in these fungal these

759
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,120
fungal problems

760
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:02,220
they're natural uh so they they tend to

761
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:04,918
thrive in the in the natural environment

762
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,259
that these plants also grow in

763
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,659
um so it's while you while you have the

764
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:11,579
optimal grow for your your cannabis

765
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:13,320
actual plant you also are putting in a

766
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:16,019
pretty optimal environment for the for

767
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:18,898
the Target pathogen that could be um

768
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:21,119
subjected to a failure for that sample

769
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:22,918
excellent excellent all right so in

770
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,739
closing here I'm wondering if you have

771
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:28,559
just some some takeaway messages or just

772
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,419
some general tips for Growers and maybe

773
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,339
even home Growers as well I mean if

774
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:34,080
people are listening in

775
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:36,019
um who maybe grow cannabis themselves

776
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,398
and maybe are concerned about any

777
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:41,819
potential microbial contamination they

778
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,379
might have there so in your what are

779
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,720
some some tips or best practices they

780
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,240
should be keeping in mind absolutely so

781
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,579
kind of like my best practices are again

782
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,980
test early test often

783
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:55,259
um and don't be afraid to ask your

784
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,179
laboratory for advice

785
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:58,980
um so like we are hopefully at the point

786
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:01,620
right now in the

787
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,679
um the industry that the Laboratories

788
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:06,538
should be well versed on the microbial

789
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,659
contaminations that are occurring and

790
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:11,579
problematic in their specific State

791
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,080
um and if they if they're not then you

792
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:15,538
need to ask someone else maybe a

793
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:17,819
consultant that can help them so again

794
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:21,119
setting up a grid like pattern

795
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:23,579
knowing where your hot spots are and

796
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,439
also sterilizing after the grow are just

797
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:28,558
going to not only they're going to help

798
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,659
keep your grow cleaner and in fact in

799
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,359
doing so hopefully limit the failures

800
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:36,419
that your grow is then subjected to

801
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,099
excellent great tips all right before I

802
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:41,399
let you go Anthony I wanted to give you

803
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:43,439
an opportunity to plug any sort of

804
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:45,418
resources that you know of or maybe you

805
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,000
you have put together that listeners

806
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:51,480
might be able to take a look at to learn

807
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,038
more about this topic and definitely let

808
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,798
us know about any social media or

809
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:58,079
websites that um that you have or or

810
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:59,819
with method testing that yeah learn more

811
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,859
about you yeah so of course I'm going to

812
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:04,200
plug method Testing Laboratories where a

813
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:06,538
compliance laboratory down here in Tampa

814
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,120
Florida if you do have any sort of

815
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:11,038
microbial question obviously I can't

816
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:14,398
test your cannabis if you're in

817
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,960
California or in Nevada but um you know

818
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:17,759
I do have a LinkedIn I'm pretty active

819
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,259
I'm pretty responsive on LinkedIn if you

820
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,480
if you guys do have any questions or if

821
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,879
anyone just has comments or you know

822
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,159
it's it's still a growing industry

823
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,299
um and I would I would say I would have

824
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,700
too big of a head to say I know

825
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:31,139
everything because I don't um and so I

826
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,940
would love to not only expand on

827
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,899
resources but networking opportunities

828
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,820
that

829
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:37,859
um can allow us to just kind of grow as

830
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:39,418
an industry together because ultimately

831
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:41,339
that's how we're going to get better as

832
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,259
an industry is if if we grow WE Network

833
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:45,298
we talk about the different problems

834
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:47,158
that are here and of course at method

835
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:49,619
Testing Laboratories um we're always

836
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,659
here to help from not only a testing

837
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:54,058
facility standpoint but also a microbial

838
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:56,039
standpoint with having not only myself

839
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:58,019
but an expert group of microbiologists

840
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:59,819
here on staff that are able to help out

841
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:02,460
whenever we need so

842
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:04,439
no yeah and I love that I think that all

843
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,538
the all the best Labs that we work with

844
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,700
take that same approach of you know

845
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:11,099
they're not just returning results they

846
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,740
want to work with the grower uh and try

847
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:14,879
to help solve their problems and um I

848
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,159
think your your approach to

849
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,860
