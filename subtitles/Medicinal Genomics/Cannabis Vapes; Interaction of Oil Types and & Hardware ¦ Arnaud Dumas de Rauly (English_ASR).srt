2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,779
all right

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,920
there's there's different oils have

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,520
different viscosities A good rule of

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,519
thumb is that distillate is is is pretty

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,920
viscous in terms of CPS where we're

7
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,578
looking at anywhere between 50 and and

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,179
100 000 CPS

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:38,280
and when you sorry what's CPS Center

10
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,259
Poise it's the measure of a viscosity of

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,340
a fluid got it

12
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:46,738
um and when we are looking at live resin

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,500
we're usually on some lower viscosities

14
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,119
because we've got some either recombined

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,640
terpenes in there or the terpenes have

16
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,640
been re-added back so we're on a product

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,759
that's a little bit more liquidy and

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,878
then when we look at live rosin which is

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:07,679
solventless which is pressed uh we go

20
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:10,920
back to something very very thick so the

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,600
the mathematical process of vaporization

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,099
is a mix of chemistry thermodynamics and

23
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,959
fluid mechanics

24
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,000
so you have to understand all three of

25
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,059
those to understand which Hardware can

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,700
work better with which oil the added

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,240
complexity of cannabis is that it is a

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,579
plant it's a natural product so from one

29
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,578
batch to the other of the exact same

30
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:38,519
strain when you process it you will have

31
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:41,758
different inputs so the trick is really

32
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:44,399
to figure out which Hardware suits which

33
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,118
oil the best we have we have a great

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,118
rule of thumb that are are uh our

35
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,500
run-of-the-mill basic cartridge the V12

36
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,680
is something that would work very well

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,078
with distillate and live resin for rosin

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,820
because you have more of that full

39
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,158
flavor because you have more of that

40
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,039
terpenes we need to use a different

41
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,360
device to make sure the client or the

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,659
patient does not heat it too much so we

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,540
increase the resistance for instance to

44
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,818
be usable on the run-of-the-mill

45
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,219
batteries that you'd be buying

46
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:23,098
um now that's just an example we can

47
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:26,098
also look at the intake hole size

48
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:28,500
because that will measure the rate at

49
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:31,318
which the oil is going to feed the coil

50
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,598
to turn into vapor so obviously the

51
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,619
thicker the oil the bigger holes you

52
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,119
need to allow more of that to seep in

53
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,099
there's there's a lot more I'm trying to

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,860
hit it really high level but there's a

55
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:47,159
lot more that goes uh that goes into

56
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,739
this and really the the the performance

57
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,900
of The Vape cartridges on the market can

58
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,759
literally be divided by 10 or multiplied

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,480
by 10 by changing one of those variables

60
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,979
right and given that that fact and that

61
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,780
you were saying you know some processors

62
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,419
they're just buying kind of cheap

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,000
Hardware from Alibaba

64
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:08,280
um I imagine that the performance and

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,199
quality of Vape carts in the marketplace

66
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,840
can vary widely

67
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:18,598
immensely we've done some testing

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,140
um with different viscosities so let's

69
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,939
say you take a very very thick liquid

70
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,139
you know like like like honey like

71
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:30,859
molasses

72
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:34,259
if you use a battery for instance at a

73
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,720
3.7 volt setting with smaller intake

74
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:41,399
holes you're essentially not going to

75
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:43,378
allow enough oil to penetrate the coil

76
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,840
um fast enough when the coil is heating

77
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:47,459
up so basically the little that has made

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,039
it into the coil is going to be burning

79
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:53,519
immediately and not only are you getting

80
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,939
bad flavor but you're also getting toxic

81
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,280
emissions because burning in essence is

82
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,959
the same thing as combustion so you're

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,120
degrading the terpenes and the

84
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,340
cannabinoids in there and uh potentially

85
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,200
ruining the The Experience now on the

86
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,759
other hand if you have too much oil that

87
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,399
goes in

88
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,219
um it and and too much of an intake hole

89
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,858
and too much of a big porosity on the

90
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,340
ceramic itself of the coil you are going

91
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,740
to see saturation which means which

92
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,539
leads to clogging which means leads to

93
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,780
leaking and potential spit back through

94
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,080
the mouthpiece so it is very very

95
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:37,859
important to really match the hardware

96
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:40,019
to the oil or vice versa and make sure

97
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,600
you have a consistent Supply I think

98
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:45,719
that's really the other the other side

99
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,560
to this is the consistency of the

100
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,560
quality of the

101
00:04:53,459 --> 00:05:02,879
