1
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:11,099
so before we get going I'll get the

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:14,109
panelists to all introduce themselves

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,050
okay I'm John McKay from new West

4
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:20,169
genetics in Fort Collins Colorado we're

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,810
creating new varieties that are high

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,910
yielding varieties for large-scale

7
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:29,858
outdoor production and creating them

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,439
from a seed basis with with certified

9
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:35,920
seeds so that it's guaranteed that the

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,859
crop does what what we say it does I'm

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,689
Allison justice I'm with outcault VP of

12
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,539
cultivation we're a vertically

13
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:47,409
integrated cannabis company in San Diego

14
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:50,049
I have a background in ornamental plant

15
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:54,309
production and research PhD plant

16
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:56,619
science from Clemson University I'm dr.

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,260
mark Lewis president of NATO research

18
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:01,589
were a tech company focused in four key

19
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:04,899
sectors of the cannabis industry

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,780
biotechnology production consumer

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,609
education and laboratory services the

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,680
road down those sectors has led to the

23
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:14,170
creation of what it's the most

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,270
chemically diverse stable and well

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,820
characterized germ plasm collection in

26
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:21,158
the world that consists of both

27
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:25,509
award-winning genetics for adult use and

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:27,609
medical use but also some say it's the

29
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:32,680
most valuable and robust intellectual

30
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:34,359
property asset in the market today I'm

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,880
John Vaughan I'm the CEO and founder of

32
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:39,879
Front Range Biosciences I have a PhD in

33
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,399
organic chemistry and just gave a talk

34
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,140
on on what we do but we do tissue

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,840
culture propagation and clean stock

36
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,478
nursery programs and and varietal

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,799
development or plant breeding and yeah

38
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,010
happy to be here and be a part of the

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,010
panel

40
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:58,440
Seth Crawford makes seeds and smell

41
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,440
plants

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,450
awesome thank you everyone

43
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,189
so with the recent changes in the

44
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,659
regulatory structure really all over the

45
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,780
world but more specifically within the

46
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:13,049
US and Canada we've seen a big shift

47
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,169
from small scale cultivation to large

48
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,530
and even you can call it massive scale

49
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:21,539
cultivation of cannabis so really that's

50
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,729
what I'd like to start with is it's

51
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:26,699
chatting a little bit about the impacts

52
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,799
of that change and specifically John

53
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,209
maybe I could pose this question to you

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,570
what are the impacts in terms of a

55
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,909
product supply product diversity and the

56
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:40,349
cost of production when it comes to that

57
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:43,729
shift certainly the the costs of

58
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:47,819
production is orders of magnitude lower

59
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:49,799
in the field then then a indoor either

60
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,769
warehouse or greenhouse production and

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,420
therefore it creates a more stable

62
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,570
supply chain

63
00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:00,030
you know if it's cheaper to to produce

64
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:03,019
you can actually over produce like we do

65
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,419
in every other agricultural industry I

66
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,090
don't know the product diversity I

67
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,488
imagine what it will decrease but I

68
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,080
that's what happened in other crops but

69
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,759
up but I don't really have a good

70
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,459
prediction there mm-hmm

71
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:20,219
how about in terms of different types of

72
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,069
products right with the shift to mass

73
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,580
production you find that they'll be we

74
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,439
have edibles obviously we have durable

75
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,320
something you will do you find or do you

76
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,919
think that that product line so to speak

77
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,739
will extend yeah I I think the consumer

78
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,759
demand is out there for the diversified

79
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,920
extracted cannabinoid products and you

80
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,810
know in Colorado as mentioned earlier it

81
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,979
went from a hundred percent flower to

82
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:53,280
less than 30 percent at the retail level

83
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:54,840
and so present and some people are not

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,209
using these products because they're too

85
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,150
expensive so I think I think it will

86
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:03,209
create more consumer demand to have a

87
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,620
more affordable feedstock mmm okay

88
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,739
thanks and I guess moving on from that

89
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,659
Marc

90
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,370
perhaps I can pose this question to you

91
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,229
do you find

92
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,699
but the shift from small-scale to

93
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:20,279
large-scale were focusing more

94
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,860
strategically on specific areas of

95
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,089
innovation given perhaps more resources

96
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,970
directed towards these initiatives

97
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:32,668
absolutely as we see innovation being

98
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,340
key in both creating innovative new

99
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:38,009
products and then also taking those

100
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:40,888
innovative products to scale innovation

101
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,870
is required in both situations I think

102
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,060
Seth pointed that out quite clearly with

103
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,709
their seed production being innovative

104
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,780
on a particular product and then be able

105
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:50,638
to take it to scale and with the

106
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,769
regulatory environment kind of changing

107
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,079
the way it has we see our neighbors to

108
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:58,620
the north innovating shifting from the

109
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:01,109
big in in mind grows to indoor grows to

110
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,490
big green house ranges now showing that

111
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,009
innovation that way and

112
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,990
south-of-the-border we see innovation in

113
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,149
individual products whether it's

114
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,650
creating stable homozygous seed that are

115
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:13,409
chemically unique and diverse in the

116
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:16,228
marketplace maybe have certain ratios of

117
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:19,020
THC to CBD in certain terpene profiles

118
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:21,149
and/or those particular products that

119
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,089
get turned into your sauces and

120
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:25,918
distillates its of course it's on a more

121
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:29,699
smaller scale but it's still innovation

122
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:33,120
nonetheless but taking a unique product

123
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:35,250
or genotype to scale requires seed

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,780
production and our humble opinion

125
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,959
because there are certain hurdles

126
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:42,478
associated with asexual propagation John

127
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,779
pointed out hence his desire to use

128
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,300
tissue culture but we find that at the

129
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,819
end of the day the most innovative way

130
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,160
to get to your your goal of having a

131
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:55,168
mass scale product is not necessarily

132
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,360
what environments you create it's how

133
00:05:55,168 --> 00:06:00,719
robust and stable the seed is that you

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,340
have and at nape row we're one of the

135
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,740
few groups like Seth who's taken the

136
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,810
time to create parental lines that breed

137
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,689
nice stable chemically and

138
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:13,829
morphologically plants so you can take a

139
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:16,978
unique ratio of THC to CBD or CBD to CPG

140
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:20,550
to scale great points and completely

141
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:23,310
agree there and I guess related to this

142
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,110
issue that you just posed what is the

143
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,259
potential and this is a question for

144
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,000
Sutton and John bought please what is

145
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:35,158
the potential for disease spread and

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,759
massive crop loss and whole varietal

147
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:44,788
loss as a result of this large-scale

148
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:46,979
system that were entering today yeah so

149
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:49,259
I think there's there's a lot of risk

150
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:50,908
with and with a new crop I think you

151
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,610
know as I mentioned in my talk a little

152
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:55,408
bit earlier you know I think where we're

153
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,580
setting ourselves up for some potential

154
00:06:55,408 --> 00:07:01,348
viral outbreaks I certainly think that

155
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:04,348
improper use of vegetative propagation

156
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:06,418
and asexual reproduction is as we just

157
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:10,228
mentioned here can can certainly lead to

158
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:11,788
that you know I think also going to see

159
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:13,639
you know there's a lot of challenges

160
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:16,259
though with with seed production I think

161
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,019
my two colleagues here just just

162
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,340
definitely you know pointed out the

163
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,990
amount of time and work that it goes

164
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,549
into creating stable seed and it's

165
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,918
something that we're certainly working

166
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,829
on as well because I think there is a

167
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,709
ton of value there and you know I think

168
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:35,339
the the big challenge with disease is

169
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:37,079
that as you really scale up your your

170
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,878
risk of loss becomes much more

171
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,038
significant so if you're a small

172
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,718
producer you know yeah it can hurt you

173
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,459
but it's not the not the end of the

174
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:46,528
world is you get to larger and larger

175
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,899
scales you know if you're a hundred

176
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:50,579
million dollar revenue company and you

177
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,348
lose potentially twenty million dollars

178
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,680
of revenue due to crop loss you have a

179
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:57,870
real problem and so you know I think

180
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,629
it's gonna take a variety of different

181
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,278
strategies you know it's it's not only

182
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:04,259
the genetics and the beginning of the

183
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:05,699
plant but it's how you grow them it's

184
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,788
where they're grown

185
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,009
I think certainly there's going to be

186
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:14,068
geographic regions that are particularly

187
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,860
useful to grow certain varieties where

188
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:18,240
they don't necessarily get exposed to

189
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,408
specific diseases or they're not they're

190
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,490
not suffering from some of those

191
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:24,990
problems but I think strong IPM or

192
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,699
integrated pest management programs

193
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,769
whether you're you know especially in

194
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,259
the greenhouse is going to be very very

195
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:33,208
important to help to prevent these

196
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:37,050
things

197
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:38,428
just add on just to touch to that one of

198
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,859
the one of the main issues that I think

199
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:42,688
we see is different requirements if

200
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,938
you're trying to produce say a trim

201
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:47,188
flower for the consumer market you need

202
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:50,549
to have uniformity and uniformity is

203
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:52,588
your greatest your greatest nemesis when

204
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:54,868
it comes to trying to get around plant

205
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,519
diseases you can have clean plant stock

206
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:58,410
but if all the plants are the same and

207
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,789
you're hit by the same particular

208
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:01,458
pathogen it's going to wipe them all out

209
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,568
you're going to lose everything you have

210
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:06,568
what we've seen in terms of field

211
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:09,269
production is that if you have very

212
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:11,759
healthy plants and some diversity still

213
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:13,078
left in that in that population they're

214
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,058
much more likely to be able to bounce

215
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:17,248
back if they are hit by some sort of

216
00:09:15,058 --> 00:09:19,769
outbreak we've also seen that outdoor

217
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:22,920
production is much much less prone when

218
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:24,389
you have healthy f1 hybrids to some of

219
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,128
these disease outbreaks but at the same

220
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,649
time you lose the ability to control and

221
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:30,869
have that uniform product at the end of

222
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,188
the day so there's different problems

223
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:33,720
that people face depending on your

224
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:37,409
production environment and your in

225
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,720
production goals and John how about the

226
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:41,458
idea of genetic banking for some of

227
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,740
these highly sought-after

228
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:49,409
varieties yeah so I mean part of any any

229
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,169
breeding program you have to have your

230
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:53,909
parental lines your your different

231
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:57,028
hybrid lines your progeny all of the

232
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:59,009
ones that that Seth so wonderfully

233
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:59,970
described in his talk just a few minutes

234
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:02,159
ago

235
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,889
you know you have to have ways to store

236
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,019
and propagate those characterize them

237
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:09,558
and so I think there's there's a lot of

238
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,850
value in that is you get to truly stable

239
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:13,969
breeding lines and parental lines the

240
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,100
ability to store and seed is certainly

241
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:21,240
you know a great way to do things as

242
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:24,149
well you know when you look at certain

243
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,249
crops a lot of them you know you can

244
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:28,409
maintain them in a clean stock program

245
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:30,600
in a nursery setting and you have

246
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:33,629
specific male and female lines that you

247
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,999
you can cross effectively to make these

248
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:38,339
f1 hybrids and being able to store and

249
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:40,528
maintain those in a disease-free

250
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,389
environment that's sterile and be able

251
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:44,809
to produce those combinations

252
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:48,200
reproducibly over and over again

253
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:51,528
is is is really part of of a good

254
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,830
breeding program from our perspective so

255
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:56,509
definitely lots of challenges ahead but

256
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,028
it sounds like we we have a number of

257
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:00,169
different tools to deal with them but

258
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:02,269
Alison I'm hoping maybe you could

259
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:04,039
discuss a little bit about what the

260
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:07,159
implications of some of these challenges

261
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:10,179
are potentially product quality and also

262
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:13,610
things like environmental stewardship

263
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:17,179
sure so I think a lot of people

264
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,730
associate quality and math skill to be

265
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:23,689
opposites and so I don't actually

266
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:26,360
correlate the two in California I think

267
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,790
we're gonna have this misconception as

268
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,169
we you know increase our licenses that

269
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,230
we give out you know growers that are

270
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:35,629
used to growing twenty lights are you

271
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,100
know running to go get a hundred acres

272
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:39,110
and they're wanted to grow that very

273
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,759
fast and they're not ready for it and

274
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,490
it's not that it can't be done

275
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,710
successfully is that those protocols

276
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:49,370
hadn't been set up so I think early on

277
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:51,019
you know in California at least you know

278
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,000
we're gonna have big growers come on and

279
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:54,259
we're gonna see poor quality but it's

280
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,240
not necessarily because it can't be done

281
00:11:54,259 --> 00:12:00,559
it's gonna be because we're rushing to

282
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,580
that as far as being environmentally

283
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,489
sustainable

284
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,730
I think regulations is going to be huge

285
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,310
for that in California for 20-plus years

286
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,230
there's been many many black market

287
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:15,229
growers that are doing whatever they

288
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:18,830
want dr. Baugh it was just saying that

289
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:22,399
you know 80% of the cannabis submitted

290
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:24,230
to steep hill is failing well that's

291
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,179
just the people that actually want to

292
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,550
submit to get a pesticide test think

293
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,769
about the ones that aren't doing that so

294
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:33,679
having you know the EPA the Department

295
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:36,620
of Ag all involved and controlling or

296
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,849
you know supporting and giving us

297
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,879
regulations on what to do with

298
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:43,659
pesticides and fertilizers I you know I

299
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,429
think is a great thing and as we grow

300
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:49,299
not necessarily individual farms grow in

301
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:52,549
size but as we grow as a legal market

302
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:55,009
bringing in the science I I think will

303
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:56,599
be absolutely more sustainable that's a

304
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,870
great point thank you

305
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,149
so we have a very diverse group here in

306
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,889
that we all either pursue indoor

307
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,899
cultivation outdoor cultivation or

308
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:07,970
perhaps a combination of the two so

309
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:14,899
that's what I'd like to transition to

310
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:17,210
discuss at this essentially are there

311
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,490
differences I guess in or similarities

312
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:22,340
between the two different cultivation

313
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,730
systems indoor versus outdoor and

314
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:29,660
perhaps John McKay you can elaborate on

315
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:32,000
that I think in terms of of breeding

316
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:34,279
targets for indoor versus outdoor

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,840
there's there's some overlap obviously

318
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:42,199
yield and specific cannabinoid profiles

319
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:45,170
are gonna be shared there as we heard

320
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,370
earlier the the disease pressure is

321
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:51,669
going to differ quite a bit between

322
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:54,429
indoor and outdoor production as well as

323
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:56,209
outdoor production across different

324
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:59,120
production environments different

325
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,759
geographies and and I think what's

326
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,470
different is on the outdoor production

327
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,519
side if you're talking about hundreds of

328
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:10,790
acres you have to have plant types that

329
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,720
are mechanically harvestable this you

330
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:19,339
know the manual labor approach doesn't

331
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:23,060
scale you know that whereas an indoor I

332
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:26,200
think those people will still be getting

333
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:29,149
away with you know more labor intensive

334
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:33,280
production systems and turning crops

335
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:37,159
over more and it's speaking strictly

336
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,740
propogation John thought perhaps you can

337
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,120
elaborate as do you see there being a

338
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,070
difference between propagation

339
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,960
mechanisms employed for outdoor versus

340
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,060
indoor I know you had showed us a slide

341
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,980
where you had a bunch of tissue culture

342
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,139
plantlets

343
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,210
outside growing to maturity so I'm just

344
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:56,539
wondering if you think there would be a

345
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:58,070
difference there yeah absolutely I mean

346
00:14:56,539 --> 00:15:01,250
at the end of the day it all boils down

347
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:05,210
to economics as it does with every crop

348
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,230
and so you know tissue culture is really

349
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:10,889
just just one tool in

350
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:14,039
in the toolbox that we use to support

351
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:17,279
clean healthy vigorous plants and a

352
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,079
uniformity as well you know when it

353
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,839
comes to the different growing

354
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,600
methodologies indoor versus outdoor you

355
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,080
know I think you know once again it

356
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,690
boils down to cost and so the ability to

357
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,509
grow hundreds or thousands of acres of a

358
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,660
plant at you know a few dollars per

359
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:39,779
plant or you know even even tens of

360
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:41,459
dollars per acre compared to growing in

361
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,709
greenhouses you know you start to see

362
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,509
the difference and if you look at indoor

363
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,780
growing which can cost hundreds of

364
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:50,399
dollars you know per plant it the the

365
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,379
numbers you know get get quite

366
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,549
staggering and there's challenges

367
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,439
involved with each of those growing

368
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:56,759
environments right you've got certainly

369
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,370
outdoors you're not going to be able to

370
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:02,009
keep pests out you know if you get a

371
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,750
massive pest invasion that's carrying

372
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:05,220
some type of virus or disease you can

373
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,629
have a real problem you can have the

374
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,190
same thing in a greenhouse but if it's a

375
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:11,129
well controlled environment greenhouse

376
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,110
you can minimize some of that risk I

377
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:15,120
think when it comes to propagation I

378
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,580
think there's a advantages for both you

379
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,190
know and until we have you know more

380
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,810
folks and and like Seth and some of the

381
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,840
work they're doing on unstabilized seed

382
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:26,939
and you know and and John up here and I

383
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,190
mean all of us are working actually on

384
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:32,100
similar programs for for breeding until

385
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,780
we can truly scale that and we can meet

386
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,490
all of the different profiles that we

387
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,439
need for all the different geographic

388
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,230
regions and we have really stable seed

389
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,540
you know we believe that asexual

390
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,450
reproduction and cloning and propagation

391
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,129
is a way to put uniform crops out into

392
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,890
the field and if it's done right they

393
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:52,429
can be clean and healthy but you know

394
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:55,350
there's there's certainly differences in

395
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:57,589
and vigor between plants that come from

396
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:01,259
clones versus plants that come from seed

397
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:04,319
there's no doubt that that seed has you

398
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:06,088
know the the most vigor and when

399
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,980
compared directly to asexual

400
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:09,809
reproduction but if you don't have

401
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,459
uniformity in your crop it can be a

402
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:13,588
regulatory risk if you're talking about

403
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:17,370
hemp and you're trying to minimize your

404
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:19,049
THC production you know as as you might

405
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,168
hear from some groups who have planted

406
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:21,368
seed

407
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,929
you know depending on where they got it

408
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:26,259
from you see a lot of a lot of

409
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:28,899
variability so you know with modern

410
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:30,339
mechanization you can use transplants

411
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:33,878
whether they come from seedlings or

412
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:35,589
clones or young plants you know you can

413
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:37,388
all use automated transplant errs to

414
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,308
plant pretty large acreages it's not as

415
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:43,148
cheap as planting seed but it certainly

416
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:44,829
gives you the uniformity so you know and

417
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:47,709
then in greenhouse there's there's

418
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:49,689
certainly reasons to to use clean you

419
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,730
know plants out of a nursery such as

420
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:54,879
ours as well because you know you can

421
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,919
you can maintain cleanliness and you

422
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:58,988
know what you're getting time after time

423
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,519
and you know you can turn your cycles in

424
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:03,220
your greenhouse very very quickly that

425
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,839
way so there's there's reasons to use

426
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,220
all of the different approaches that

427
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,199
we're talking about and I think it

428
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,419
really boils down to what your target

429
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,819
product is what your cost of production

430
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,830
is what geography you're in you know

431
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:17,259
obviously growing outdoors and some

432
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:19,358
climates may not be such a good idea

433
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:21,489
especially with climate change there's a

434
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:23,439
lot of risk you know with some of the

435
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:26,200
storm patterns that we see so I think it

436
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,730
really boils down to to where you're at

437
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,669
and and what your goals are mm-hmm so

438
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:35,349
speaking of propagation from seed I mean

439
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:36,970
there's the ability to do feminized

440
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:40,738
seeds obviously a hundred percent or

441
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,659
close to female seed but there's also

442
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:46,149
the possibility of hermaphroditism

443
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:47,559
within some of these plants so Seth I'm

444
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:51,339
hoping you can elaborate what the

445
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:54,308
impacts of I guess pollen transfer in

446
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:57,608
indoor versus and outdoor cultivation

447
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:59,288
system may be yeah forget about disease

448
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:00,849
and pests if you're concerned about the

449
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:02,919
quality of your product and you're going

450
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:05,349
outside your main problem is going to be

451
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:09,580
pollen coming from people who don't know

452
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:11,888
what they're doing period whether it's

453
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:14,769
their fault for not knowing what they're

454
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:17,729
doing or unsavory characters selling

455
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:20,940
seed that's not necessarily all female

456
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,589
you even if you're doing a good job

457
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,239
hermaphrodite hermaphrodites do happen

458
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:26,678
in any given population and it's

459
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:29,079
sometimes it's genetically determined

460
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,659
and in other cases more often it's

461
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:33,679
environmentally influenced you can have

462
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:35,690
clones growing in the same field

463
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,029
and if you end up having a vole go out

464
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,250
and girdle the plant it might sprout and

465
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:41,750
mail flowers if it doesn't get the right

466
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,640
amount of water because there's a plug

467
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,619
in your drip tape it might sprout male

468
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,790
flowers there's there's a million

469
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:49,279
different reasons why that could

470
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:51,109
potentially happen and pollen is

471
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,639
pernicious especially when you start

472
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:55,189
getting it in dense concentrations

473
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,190
there's some really good research in

474
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,840
Spain happened in the late 80s through

475
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,480
the early 90s where they were tracking

476
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,159
pollen dispersal from Morocco where hash

477
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,500
production using male and female seed

478
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,870
was was the norm and they could track

479
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,490
when there was two plantings that happen

480
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:12,169
consistently in Morocco early in late

481
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,490
and they could track when those

482
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,259
plantings were happening and when the

483
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,049
plants are finishing up based on the

484
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:21,710
pollen travel which went across the

485
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:25,399
Strait of Gibraltar and when as much as

486
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:27,980
250 miles inland into Spain it's a it's

487
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,750
a huge problem we've been suffering huge

488
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,579
setbacks in Oregon for the last four

489
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,440
years because of this and would

490
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:35,659
encourage anybody who has industrial

491
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,120
hemp programs there's obviously talk of

492
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,160
this in California as well to make sure

493
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:43,339
there is at least some sort of

494
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,990
requirement that farmers know what type

495
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:46,429
of seed they're planting have some

496
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:50,390
verification that it is actually

497
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,799
feminized although there's also problems

498
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,110
that go along with that too as we saw

499
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,779
some some plants are male and phenotype

500
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:58,039
but have two x-chromosomes so it's it's

501
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:00,889
definitely an issue and it's something

502
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:03,019
to watch out for are there any legal

503
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,090
implications and in any of these regions

504
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:07,609
as a result of this very much so

505
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:11,230
although right now we're looking at

506
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:13,879
areas of legal theory on trespass and

507
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,220
essentially economic economic

508
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,430
deprivation so what we're looking at is

509
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,380
a farmer in in Oregon there is case law

510
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:24,200
that supports this using smoke from

511
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,150
fires as some sort of trespass from one

512
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,299
property to the next but we're actually

513
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,910
investigating that as a potential

514
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:33,619
potential legal tool to dissuade farmers

515
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,620
from growing cheaper male and female

516
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:38,479
seed who don't understand that it's more

517
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:42,139
problematic and causes irreparable harm

518
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,360
to your neighbors just for the benefit

519
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,090
of getting a slightly cheaper seed

520
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:50,779
and in an indoor production system is

521
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:53,619
there is there any downside to it or I

522
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:56,269
guess it's not as large I would imagine

523
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:58,279
in terms of the the implications for

524
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:00,079
something yeah it's not as big you know

525
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,210
that when you think about the impact

526
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,299
that one male plant can have in a field

527
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,190
if it's not properly dealt with what

528
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,779
we've seen is that one male plant can

529
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,190
pollinate and you'll see a concentric

530
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:12,049
circle essentially around it following

531
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,090
wind patterns but it you'll have an acre

532
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:16,159
of seeded plants and when you have a

533
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:19,069
seeded plant you're losing approximately

534
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,750
50% of your usable biomass and 30% of

535
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:22,129
your total cannabinoids we have good

536
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,829
data on this because it happens to us

537
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,350
regularly that's why we don't make seed

538
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:28,849
outside we only make it inside very

539
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:30,949
controlled environments of the lots of

540
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:34,389
filters great thanks

541
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:36,590
so again speaking indoor versus outdoor

542
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:40,070
Allison and Mark I'm hoping to pose this

543
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:42,259
question to you guys how's this shift in

544
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:45,109
the focus on like production of high

545
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:47,829
margin products such as organics differ

546
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:50,899
between those two cultivation systems I

547
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:53,449
mean for me I love this question because

548
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,890
it makes you beg the what's the

549
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:58,910
definition of high margin and you know

550
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,570
high margin is defined by being

551
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,680
innovative

552
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:06,980
you know protected and and distinct from

553
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,259
what else is in the marketplace organic

554
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,509
will help you do that but then it just

555
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:14,089
comes down to a resource question indoor

556
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:16,460
obviously is going to be more electrical

557
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:20,269
and lighting but in California we get

558
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:23,690
half a million joules of sunlight that's

559
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:26,509
carbon emission free no bill from Mother

560
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,660
Nature for that light and that you know

561
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:31,849
helps on the margin side but the true

562
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:34,279
way to keep those margins up is by for

563
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:36,529
example using award-winning genetics

564
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,210
that people truly love in the

565
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:41,029
marketplace that are different

566
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,460
chemically that make you have a specific

567
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:45,680
experience and lemon crush is a great

568
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,019
example of this it won the Emerald cup

569
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,269
last year and the farmer growing it

570
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:54,500
happened to be selecting it specifically

571
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:55,039
for botrytis resistance and Wow what do

572
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,829
you know

573
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:01,158
it's very tolerant to portraitist

574
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:03,829
and maintain structure across the tire

575
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,690
seed crop but more importantly it had

576
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:08,808
delicious flavor and imparted an

577
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,820
experience that was unique and novel in

578
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:13,849
the marketplace that same grower

579
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:16,069
produced something called guava jam also

580
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:19,428
very innovative it's one to one

581
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:22,329
CBD v to CBD and it had about 0.3

582
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:24,889
percent THC but all of the users

583
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:26,839
explained it give them effect somewhere

584
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:29,118
between caffeine and nicotine without

585
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,918
the jitters and it totally wiped out

586
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:33,558
their appetite that's the type of

587
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,840
innovation that can truly kind of shape

588
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:37,278
a high margin product because then you

589
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,470
have this whole new market segment

590
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,868
opened up I always like to say that the

591
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,269
largest you know I when I give talks I

592
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:45,528
bait the audience I'll say who in here

593
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:47,659
thinks they know who the largest

594
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:49,999
demographic of cannabis smokers is and

595
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:53,149
everybody will say baby boomers or young

596
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:56,450
kids and I say no no it's those who

597
00:24:53,148 --> 00:24:58,668
haven't used it yet you know that's the

598
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,528
market we're going for right and and

599
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:02,419
that's kind of how we we kind of strive

600
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:04,628
to do that innovation work we always ask

601
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:07,278
what if how do we reduce our cost

602
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:09,288
increase the margins how do you always

603
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,019
go towards agriculture I mean I was

604
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:15,079
rooted in 4h as a kid so when I saw

605
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:18,108
people buying jugs of liquid nutrients

606
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:20,178
at the store I was like just take some

607
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:21,589
Scots and put it in water it's the same

608
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:24,379
thing and you're not paying for the

609
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:26,388
shipping costs I mean it it's very crazy

610
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:28,928
the way that prohibition took this

611
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:31,368
marketplace into the dark ages but now

612
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:34,609
I'm glad to see we're coming out of them

613
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:36,918
right that's great yeah and I'm

614
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:40,960
absolutely with you genetics is a huge

615
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:43,009
thing all right but second coming from

616
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,288
ornamentals where you know there's a

617
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:49,278
hundred acre greenhouses and it's grown

618
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:51,648
from cut shipped from Guatemala and the

619
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,329
input per plant is very low

620
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:55,038
I think the cannabis industry as a whole

621
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:56,358
whether it's outdoor indoor you know

622
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,658
we've got to get this cost of goods sold

623
00:25:56,358 --> 00:26:01,128
way down indoor outdoor outdoors got a

624
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:03,230
little more leeway just because the

625
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:05,748
price per pound you don't have to pay

626
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,480
for the Sun it's already pretty low but

627
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:11,390
indoor I mean the cost people are

628
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,900
putting in just on the cultivation

629
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:17,300
per pound is pretty outrageous at our

630
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,320
indoor indoor facility we use LEDs so

631
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:22,460
you know right there we're already

632
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:25,369
saving 40% and lighting costs we mix our

633
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,890
own nutrients so you know compared to

634
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:29,689
some of the other bottle of nutrients

635
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:33,259
it's about twenty four times less the

636
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:36,529
cost you know that still is about $400

637
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:38,359
per pound to produce and that is

638
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:40,339
absolutely outrageous especially if

639
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,289
you're thinking about a poor organ up

640
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:44,179
there that's getting four five hundred

641
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:46,909
dollars a pound you're not making any

642
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,910
money and the four hundred dollars is

643
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:52,940
not including any taxes any post-harvest

644
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:54,830
trimming or whatnot and whatever other

645
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,330
you know else you wanna throw on top of

646
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:59,480
that so I think you know what we've

647
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:01,609
really got to do is be innovative we've

648
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,110
got to bring science and you know a lot

649
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:05,179
of the practices that grow or

650
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:07,369
specifically endure doing they're not

651
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,930
doing it from science and so a lot of

652
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:10,129
the science that can be applied you know

653
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:13,220
maybe you don't need as much light so

654
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,540
maybe you can cut down that price we've

655
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,569
just got to get our cost of goods down

656
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:19,759
bring in the science and and we we all

657
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,399
know that the competition's gonna get

658
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,440
much more stiff right and at the end of

659
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,480
the day the winners they're gonna be the

660
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,700
ones holding the distinct unique and

661
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,559
protected genetics that produce the

662
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,620
products that maintain those margins I

663
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,829
mean so really a focus on genetics but

664
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:39,379
also bringing in all these other aspects

665
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:42,829
of science so far from lighting right to

666
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:45,050
other cultivation based businesses and

667
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:48,439
kind of coupling all that together to

668
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:50,149
make it work for you to pick not I guess

669
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,420
regardless of whether it's indoor or

670
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,730
outdoor perfect so I'd like to switch

671
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,840
gears a little bit and talk a little bit

672
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:02,558
about breeding and to me

673
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,499
there's I guess two main avenues if

674
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:07,509
you're conducting any type of cannabis

675
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:09,819
breeding and that's breeding for flower

676
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:13,269
or breeding with the end goal of

677
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:15,519
extraction and derivative products so

678
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:20,528
I'd like to I guess pose this question

679
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:22,749
to mark Seth and John please

680
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:26,019
are there differences in breeding

681
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:28,298
strategies and the traits you're seeking

682
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:31,749
in these breeding programs depending on

683
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:34,658
one of those end goals I'll go ahead and

684
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:37,720
jump off if you want the the extraction

685
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:39,940
vers flower thing is critical I we we do

686
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,788
time course on hundreds of different

687
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,649
varietals and some will peak in oil and

688
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:47,079
cannabinoid production you know day

689
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:48,398
thirty five or forty by weight mass and

690
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:50,439
if you were extracting you'd want that

691
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,148
but if you wanted the uniform in the

692
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,460
product like Seth was talking for the

693
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:56,258
bag appeal for the flower you need that

694
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,149
the flower to actually fill in and

695
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:00,669
become full which sometimes takes up

696
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:02,699
four to sixty or seventy days and the

697
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:05,559
interplay between your cannabinoid

698
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,590
ratios changes throughout that time

699
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:10,210
course as well as does the locking in of

700
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:12,158
your terpene cassette or your final

701
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,869
knows and it's just important for

702
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,090
everybody to remember that everything is

703
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:18,158
a trait and all of them can be isolated

704
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,689
and exploited and used to create these

705
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:26,350
products that are designed for either

706
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:30,429
extraction or flowers so much so much

707
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:31,898
did I'm just thinking about one of the

708
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:34,360
experiments that we conducted this this

709
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:36,758
past summer was using day-neutral plants

710
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,258
auto flowering plants it's one of the

711
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:40,419
main issues that we have with dealing

712
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:42,878
with tons of biomass at a time is how in

713
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:46,210
the hell do you dry at all takes a lot

714
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:48,969
of space a lot of space in general if

715
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,340
you're trying to grow out door trim

716
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,440
flower tops you're looking at basically

717
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:56,138
two acres can fit in a 5,000 square foot

718
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,340
space we wanted to get to the point

719
00:29:56,138 --> 00:29:59,349
where we could reduce the price of

720
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:01,509
biomass but at the same time also have a

721
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:03,638
robust terpene profile still available

722
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:06,490
for a quote unquote full-spectrum oil

723
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:07,099
extraction we had no idea what was going

724
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,538
to happen

725
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,399
cut plants down in the middle of August

726
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:12,109
and laid him on black plastic in the Sun

727
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,730
when it was 90 degrees outside but we

728
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:17,509
expected that a lot of the terpenes

729
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:20,419
would vaporize shocker they did right

730
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:23,150
but some didn't and the terpene fraction

731
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:24,980
the the relative constituent elements of

732
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,750
that terpene fraction changed in very

733
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,400
interesting ways which made us think

734
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:31,009
well if we could target those specific

735
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,890
terpenes and get rid of some of these

736
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:35,179
other ones we could maybe have a much

737
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,730
more stable product using this

738
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:40,370
particular approach in terms of

739
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:43,929
structure yeah there's a lot of a lot of

740
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:46,158
different breeding that goes into that

741
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:48,590
what you're gonna see is that hybrids

742
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,690
tend to have the most in terms of

743
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:53,119
overall yield and bag appeal there

744
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,580
excuse me not bag appeal but just yield

745
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,649
they're much much more prolific in terms

746
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:59,119
of flower production but at the same

747
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,630
time they're cannabinoid concentrations

748
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:04,399
don't tend to be as high so it's you get

749
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,809
to pick there's three different things

750
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,048
that you want and you get to pick two

751
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:12,649
it's sort of a truism in life mm-hmm and

752
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:15,829
when we're talking terpenes is it always

753
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:17,990
the goal to have a full spectrum kind of

754
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:19,519
extracted product or do you maybe want

755
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:23,210
to remove those terpenes at some point

756
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,548
when we're trying to adapt for

757
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,950
large-scale combines okay if you've

758
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:30,668
touched cannabis with lots of terpenes

759
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,840
and lots of cannabinoids they're sticky

760
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:35,120
combines don't like stickiness and they

761
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:37,250
gum up after about 20 feet in a field if

762
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,139
you have a really nice crop we

763
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:42,500
specifically targeted plants that had no

764
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,179
terpenes down to 0.2% terpenes not

765
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,619
because I believe in it I think I don't

766
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:47,419
think it's the right approach in terms

767
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:49,579
of cannabis as a medicine going forward

768
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:51,259
but people do want to make isolate and

769
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:52,819
they do want a machine harvest and there

770
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:54,470
are now apparently somebody invented

771
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:55,668
plants that don't have any cannabinoids

772
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,610
and you could just extract the terpenes

773
00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:00,080
and recombine them having a terpene free

774
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:02,229
plant will allow you to be able to

775
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,038
harvest thousands of acres so it is

776
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:07,130
potentially a good option to do

777
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:09,589
something like that great one of one of

778
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,929
the things we one of our challenges is

779
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:15,199
all of the different producers in

780
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:17,650
Colorado are using different approaches

781
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,230
to go from a standing crop to

782
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:23,140
- either an extract or a sellable dried

783
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,970
product and so from a breeding

784
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,090
perspective there's actually gonna be an

785
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,529
optimum video type for each of those but

786
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:33,250
we don't know which one of those is

787
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:34,990
going to become the you know or if any

788
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,779
of them there may be some other approach

789
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:40,960
that becomes the standard but you

790
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:43,899
basically for any given pipeline of

791
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,539
processing you can increase the harvest

792
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,970
index or the percent of the biomass that

793
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:52,480
is actually useful for that

794
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:54,819
whereas on on the the flower side that's

795
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,140
you know that that's a different

796
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:58,720
approach where you're taking a very

797
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,410
small percentage of the plant that has

798
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,120
the features that you want mm-hmm okay I

799
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:06,130
mean even more so than that it the

800
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:08,409
structure of the trichome is specific

801
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,870
per application because some people in

802
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:14,410
the world prefer more natural products

803
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:17,079
like mechanically extracted trichome

804
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:20,170
heads versus a solvent extracted

805
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:22,289
cannabinoid fraction so breeding plants

806
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:25,330
that have heads a certain size and a

807
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:30,549
certain stock length that really work

808
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:32,919
well in a cured or cured resin type dry

809
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:35,289
sift is also a way to go to get really

810
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,850
high quality really high margin items

811
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:38,200
because if you get just those trichome

812
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:40,269
heads in there and they're chock-full of

813
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,069
that goodness that we all know that's

814
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,808
they call that hundred-meter hash

815
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:45,819
because it doesn't get further away from

816
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:51,399
the grow it was grown at been a hundred

817
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:53,379
meters and how about other aspects of

818
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,019
plant morphology catered more towards

819
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,970
maybe the labor involved in plant

820
00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:00,730
maintenance are there differences

821
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,860
between outdoor but rather breeding for

822
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,150
flowers this extraction will seed versus

823
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:07,119
cloned I mean there's a huge difference

824
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:09,519
the seed has a you know a blueprint

825
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,779
where it creates its architecture so you

826
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,059
don't have to do all that extra

827
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,040
horticulture that you have to that's

828
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:18,099
associated with adventitious buds shoots

829
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,110
on a sexually propagated plants and you

830
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:22,299
can actually breed plants and to not

831
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,030
have adventitious shoots I mean there's

832
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,700
lines that we've messed with that only

833
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,019
have sets on their main branches and

834
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:31,339
there's no

835
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:34,389
adventitious branching at all which

836
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:37,010
really minimizes your labor in the field

837
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:39,619
because most of our clients are in

838
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,270
greenhouses they summon indoor still but

839
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,579
the greenhouse is where the labor

840
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:46,039
becomes difficult especially when the

841
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:47,449
things planted wall the wall or or you

842
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:49,099
have a rolling bench system and it's

843
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:51,168
difficult to get in and out of there you

844
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:53,509
don't you don't want those vectors for

845
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:55,398
disease number one but you also want the

846
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,650
plant to be able to execute the way it

847
00:34:55,398 --> 00:35:00,549
was designed and it's DNA to execute

848
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:03,050
without stress great thank you and

849
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:10,970
Alison or John do you have anything to

850
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:14,900
add to that topic the lack of reducing

851
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:17,419
branch eNOS is definitely a feature for

852
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,190
mechanical harvest that you know that's

853
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,210
what's been done in every other crop

854
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:25,220
species that's been domesticated

855
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:29,929
combines don't like terpene resin and

856
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:32,929
they don't like branch eNOS I think

857
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:36,710
endure the future there is controlled

858
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:40,279
environment LEDs very automated systems

859
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:42,769
and you know whereas outdoor not having

860
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,490
to pinch and train is you know a great

861
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:50,929
thing because the Sun has a very deep

862
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:54,349
photon reach LEDs do not and so you want

863
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:56,179
your plants very compact and you know

864
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:58,670
there could be a way to do that by seed

865
00:35:56,179 --> 00:36:00,559
but at least today and what I've

866
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,840
experienced personally you know

867
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:06,019
vegetative cuts of are the easiest way

868
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,960
to achieve that mmm-hmm and I think even

869
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:10,670
aside from extraction versus flower that

870
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,920
the traits are going after really depend

871
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,329
on where you're actually planning on

872
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,460
growing those plants right

873
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:19,509
if you're doing something in South

874
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,679
America versus Canada there is a quite a

875
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,960
difference between things you may want

876
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,839
to go after such as cold tolerance

877
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,030
versus drought resistance right so I

878
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,010
think there's a that's a very

879
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,660
interesting conversation and it's going

880
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,010
to be never following more as we move

881
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:36,949
forward

882
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:44,270
so with that I think let's give a round

883
00:36:36,949 --> 00:36:45,798
of applause to all our panelists and we

884
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:48,829
have about three minutes or so for

885
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:52,009
questions I have way so many questions

886
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:53,780
but I only asked one the the harvest

887
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,510
obviously is an issue but somebody

888
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:01,040
planted 1,500 acres or whatever it was

889
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:03,380
and were those bushy plants or what they

890
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:05,119
were and did you guys use like donnie

891
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,480
grows harvesting equipment out of europe

892
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,838
for that or you three minutes I don't do

893
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,670
stuff like that because it's crazy these

894
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:15,349
it's it's so much labor we have a

895
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,309
sixty-three acre R&amp;D farm and that's

896
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:18,470
plenty

897
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:20,269
these folks used a corn Harvester and

898
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:22,459
literally just came in and ground it up

899
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:24,858
and then used hop dryers to try the

900
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,039
resulting biomass most of the stem in

901
00:37:24,858 --> 00:37:30,078
stock get kicked out the back with the

902
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,940
really big stalks they they break

903
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,200
combines yeah then that's what we had

904
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,929
the problem with it so it has anybody

905
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,480
had any success with with equipment for

906
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:41,750
harvesting other than that type of

907
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,409
equipment yes that's been the most

908
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,760
successful successful thanks I was

909
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:48,469
actually hoping to ask you guys went

910
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,910
over indoor versus outdoor cultivation

911
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:51,769
but one thing that I didn't see touched

912
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:53,779
on was that the environment obviously

913
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,980
changes the expression for the terpenes

914
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,839
in the cannabinoids he's like the

915
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,780
somebody mentioned a CBG plant that was

916
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:01,068
from clone yesterday

917
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,480
what variation is saying i've noticed

918
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:03,739
from my own cultivation and g-dubs

919
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,358
experiments and others that indoor

920
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,129
plants don't express the cannabinoids

921
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,650
and terpenoids that you see an outdoor

922
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,019
cultivation so my outdoor be better for

923
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:15,619
getting more unique and diverse plant

924
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:18,259
groups yeah if you look at I gave a talk

925
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:20,900
at canva in 2016 we looked at just these

926
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:23,720
factors light is the big one obviously

927
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,309
because outside you you know light falls

928
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,929
off exponentially with distance and

929
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:29,030
we're so far away from the Sun that the

930
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:31,129
little six feet doesn't really matter

931
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:35,319
but inside a grow room where you have a

932
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:37,730
light bulb or an LED as Allison said the

933
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:40,039
the light falls off exponentially pretty

934
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:43,190
quickly so that's that's impact number

935
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:45,019
number number one with that but if you

936
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,849
look at seed and if you have a

937
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:49,400
chemically stable varietal

938
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:51,769
then that chemically stable varietal as

939
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,630
I shown in my talk is actually more

940
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:56,570
stable than an a sexually propagated

941
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:59,180
clone over multiple multiple Lots but

942
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:01,180
that same clone grown in indoor versus

943
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:03,739
grown in greenhouses Burstein house

944
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:06,500
indoor greenhouse and outdoor actually

945
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:08,449
there were like 87 different lots of it

946
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,880
across four different environments and

947
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:12,859
you know that was when we were trying to

948
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,840
define the classification system based

949
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,120
on terpene profile and cannabinoid

950
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,070
profile and the difficulty with that was

951
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,000
that these genotypes like you said

952
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,430
expressed differently in different

953
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,050
environments and anytime you stress them

954
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:25,909
they have a tendency to become more Mir

955
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,769
seen dominant than anytime you give them

956
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:30,589
a lot of light they have a tendency to

957
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:32,840
go towards the terpenes that they don't

958
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,250
normally what wouldn't produce in a

959
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,840
stress situation you know our experience

960
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,760
i've been actually studying that and

961
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,470
finding its abscisic acid jazz monic

962
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,030
acid and salicylic acid that are being

963
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:42,679
generated by those different stresses

964
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,090
which is creating that terpene variation

965
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:47,089
myself so have you looked at anything

966
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,460
like that we started two years ago but

967
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:51,140
that became just too many irons in the

968
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,720
fire I would love it to link up with you

969
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,940
and talk about it though yeah really

970
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,739
quick one thing to add to this I mean in

971
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,230
in the tissue culture lab we've you know

972
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:02,929
virtually wiped out the the microbiome

973
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,699
in a plant and cleaned it and then

974
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:07,779
reenact you lated with different things

975
00:40:04,699 --> 00:40:09,829
and we've actually seen changes in

976
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,830
cannabinoid expression and other things

977
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:14,539
and so I think there's a lot of a lot of

978
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:15,920
forces at work here so I think Mark

979
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:18,320
mentioned you know light is obviously

980
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,750
huge and wavelength and and and photo

981
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,300
period and then there's the the genotype

982
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:25,130
of the actual plant and then you've got

983
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,610
the microbiome and your soil and your

984
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,930
nutrients and from what I can see in the

985
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:33,349
work that we've done in the data we've

986
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:35,179
got is that all of these factors really

987
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:39,110
can play into cannabinoid expression

988
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:41,839
terpene expression and and so it it's

989
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:43,370
it's highly variable at this stage and

990
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,780
if you're interested in this topic I

991
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:47,900
highly encourage you to check out the

992
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,400
2016 kin med talk because we compared

993
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,500
conventional nutrients versus organic

994
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,539
and all those different things to mess

995
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,090
with the biome to see that exact change

996
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:57,860
and the cannabinoid profile is pretty

997
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,260
robust it doesn't change as much with

998
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:03,050
the environment but the terpene profiles

999
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,990
very open to like epigenetic influences

1000
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:07,010
for sure cool how's it going guys my

1001
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:09,529
name is Manny I'm with bird Valley

1002
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,480
organics we have a licensed cultivation

1003
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:13,670
facility and distribution in California

1004
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,550
but we grow everything in Hugo beds and

1005
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:18,200
so we have a very big biodiversity going

1006
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:20,539
on there I haven't seen anybody really

1007
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:21,739
advocate on organic cultivation and I

1008
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:24,590
kind of wanted to want what was

1009
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:26,689
wondering why well you know it

1010
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:28,940
commercially commercial production I

1011
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,260
hear you know I know everybody's talking

1012
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,150
about numbers and everybody's talking

1013
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,850
about like you know margins and stuff

1014
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:38,240
like that but we're spending about $44

1015
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:40,819
per pound on our facility we make most

1016
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:43,879
of our nutrients from scratch we use

1017
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:46,789
companion planting everybody has a role

1018
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,010
within the Hugo bed soil food web

1019
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:51,230
techniques I know on a commercial level

1020
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,910
it's very very hard to do but also like

1021
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,119
when it comes to battling pests battling

1022
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:58,879
disease you know you can't really get a

1023
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:02,090
stronger plant I feel unless you're have

1024
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,930
a good soil 100% agree we have a client

1025
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:07,789
and Salinas molecular farms they're 100%

1026
00:42:05,929 --> 00:42:09,739
organic they build their own soil they

1027
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:11,420
grow cover crops turn it in it's

1028
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:13,729
actually less expensive than

1029
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,500
conventional except for when it becomes

1030
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,480
flowering time and you have to pay for

1031
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,858
all those beneficials and then it gets

1032
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,579
rather rather costly

1033
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:24,400
you know those predator wasps and and

1034
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:26,630
ladybugs ain't cheap to cover acres I

1035
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,340
mean if you're getting ladybugs you're

1036
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,990
not really doing much ladybugs are

1037
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,170
generalists you know you want to go more

1038
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:34,669
for like you know specific banker plants

1039
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,099
and all that stuff to so you're hoping

1040
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,019
to cultivate active communities of your

1041
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:41,029
insect population your beneficials

1042
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:43,190
especially you know we they use pepper

1043
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,690
plants and begonias to do their predator

1044
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,450
mites and they hang them over their

1045
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:50,000
plants and then in the trust supports in

1046
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:52,009
the greenhouse and whatnot and all of

1047
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,780
the plant components after harvest and

1048
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,910
all of that stuff get composted and then

1049
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,980
that compost reconstituted into the soil

1050
00:42:55,909 --> 00:43:00,349
so it's they really try to focus on

1051
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,150
having a zero waste sort of system as

1052
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:04,460
far as the biomass is concerned because

1053
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:06,619
that organic material is essentially

1054
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,269
what that biome is gonna feed off of and

1055
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:10,039
if you keep nourishing it will be

1056
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:10,460
healthy and the plants will be healthy

1057
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:12,739
too

1058
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,720
and what's amazing isn't that soil

1059
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:16,250
it's like two days after harvest and you

1060
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,230
can just pull the stalk out the roots

1061
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,510
are completely chewed up by all of them

1062
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,139
mycorrhizae and the act of biome it's

1063
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,580
pretty amazing

1064
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:27,348
okay thank you just a quick question we

1065
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:29,690
heard a lot about tissue culture and

1066
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:31,309
about seed propagation but I don't know

1067
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:36,588
if anybody's looked into synthetic seed

1068
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:39,829
and any uh any one step better it's

1069
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:42,019
combination of seed true f one's from

1070
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:44,088
seed and tissue culture it's a haploid

1071
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:46,670
production you take a little bit of

1072
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:48,829
pollen from a single female if you like

1073
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,480
to just use females like we do and you

1074
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:51,799
drop it into tissue culture it's all

1075
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,219
about the timing but you end up with the

1076
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,619
plant that only has one chromosome you

1077
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:59,899
double that by mutating it with with the

1078
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:01,579
mutagen and you end up with two copies

1079
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,260
of the same chromosome if you use the

1080
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:04,699
same traditional print plant breeding

1081
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,060
techniques that I was describing before

1082
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:10,399
you end up with a true essentially from

1083
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:12,049
clone it'd be the same thing as plants

1084
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,490
from tissue culture but using a

1085
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:15,490
combination of those two technologies

1086
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:23,000
thank you that last comment was very

1087
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:25,519
revealing and I've noticed that I'm

1088
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,440
you're talking about the feminized in

1089
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,630
breeding to environmentally acclimate or

1090
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,010
stabilize the plants genetically have

1091
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,500
you had problem and interview had

1092
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,020
problems with too many generations

1093
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,599
because of inbreeding depression and

1094
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:41,449
losing desirable traits or how many

1095
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,640
generations have you been able to go how

1096
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:45,858
long does it take to close to stabilize

1097
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:48,469
the plant and I'm sorry for having more

1098
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:51,529
than one part but and can you get 100%

1099
00:44:48,469 --> 00:44:53,329
homozygous or 100% stable and I'd like

1100
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:55,310
to hear from everybody else - but we

1101
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:57,230
don't we've seen plants become infertile

1102
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:59,358
at the second generation we've seen

1103
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,699
plants become infertile at the sixth or

1104
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,710
seventh generation there's a tendency at

1105
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:06,858
least from what we've seen on the THC

1106
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:08,838
side plants seem to be fertile for more

1107
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:13,098
generations of inbreeding compared to

1108
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:14,809
the the CBD or CPG side but no cannabis

1109
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:15,980
is an obligate out crosser and I just

1110
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:18,440
don't see it unless you're using

1111
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,900
haploids I don't see a way of getting to

1112
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,889
truly homozygous plants you'll get close

1113
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:25,740
for many of your traits but

1114
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:27,808
haven't seen it but we can get

1115
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:29,608
homozygosity across multiple traits but

1116
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:32,490
not all like you said two out of three

1117
00:45:29,608 --> 00:45:34,170
ain't bad and until we find a really

1118
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:35,818
good inducer line like he's talking

1119
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:39,690
about for cannabis it's going to be a

1120
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:43,288
challenge to get those but at the end of

1121
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:45,960
the day it's about making products for

1122
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:47,460
people so you have to consider what they

1123
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,940
want and if it's an a sexually

1124
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,920
propagated thing it is but you know I've

1125
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,599
got a quick comment I mean I think one

1126
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,829
of the things that that we're hearing up

1127
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:57,690
here is there's there's different ways

1128
00:45:55,829 --> 00:46:00,930
to do this and I think the thing to keep

1129
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:03,599
in mind is you know breeding does take a

1130
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:05,278
long time it's a lot of work it does

1131
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,579
take a long time there's challenges with

1132
00:46:05,278 --> 00:46:07,768
it

1133
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,568
this plant presents some some unique

1134
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:12,598
challenges but but some challenges have

1135
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:14,190
been solved in other crops you know our

1136
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,048
position is that it's really a

1137
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:17,369
combination of all these tools that are

1138
00:46:16,048 --> 00:46:20,038
going to help solve this supply chain

1139
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:22,048
problem and you know and I think the

1140
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:24,510
nice thing about asexual reproduction is

1141
00:46:22,048 --> 00:46:26,338
that you can identify a unique variety

1142
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:28,140
and as soon as you do you can

1143
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:30,778
mass-produce it very quickly so it's the

1144
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:33,808
fastest way to deploy a new variety to

1145
00:46:30,778 --> 00:46:36,028
market now over time you know is you

1146
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:38,099
want to get to stable breeding lines and

1147
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:39,809
get seed products out because seed is

1148
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:42,809
one it's much easier as a product to

1149
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:44,819
manage sell distribute and there's

1150
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:47,220
certainly advantages when you go to

1151
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:50,038
large-scale outdoor production of using

1152
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:51,959
seed so I think it's really a

1153
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,630
combination of all of these technologies

1154
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,309
you know to help deal with this rapidly

1155
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,180
growing industry Marc you hit the nail

1156
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:59,039
on the head earlier the largest

1157
00:46:57,179 --> 00:47:00,929
demographic is the ninety percent of the

1158
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:05,220
world's population that never really

1159
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:06,659
uses this plant yet and you know I don't

1160
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:08,278
think they're gonna be taking bong hits

1161
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:10,469
I don't think they're gonna be smoking

1162
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:12,088
blunts you know I think they're gonna be

1163
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:14,909
taking you know well-formulated

1164
00:47:12,088 --> 00:47:16,739
tinctures and nutraceuticals and and

1165
00:47:14,909 --> 00:47:19,078
things that people are familiar and

1166
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:21,328
comfortable with and can be safe and so

1167
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,710
in in order to do that it's it's going

1168
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:24,839
to take a combination of these different

1169
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,298
approaches to achieve those economics

1170
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:29,849
that allow us to meet that level of

1171
00:47:27,298 --> 00:47:31,440
demand that's coming and to answer your

1172
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:33,809
question in our experience it's been

1173
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,740
genotype specific some things can go

1174
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,720
down the road a little

1175
00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:38,489
further than others and you know some

1176
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,169
things produce pollen better than others

1177
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:44,039
some things that seed better than others

1178
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:46,700
again it's a trait right awesome thank

1179
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:46,699
you very much
