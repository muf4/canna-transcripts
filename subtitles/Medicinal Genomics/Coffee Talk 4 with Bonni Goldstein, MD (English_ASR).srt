medicine keynote presenter dr. Bonnie

11
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:43,939
goldstein of canna centers bonnie is a

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,878
kin med staple in fact she has either

13
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:49,189
presented at or attended every can med

14
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,549
event going back to our very first at

15
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:54,948
Harvard Medical School she has also been

16
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:56,899
a very important part of the km advisory

17
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:58,698
board where she helps to shape the

18
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:01,160
content of the conference each year

19
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:03,829
bonnie has treated thousands of patients

20
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,649
with cannabis medicine and as I learned

21
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:10,099
from our conversation her patients range

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,890
in age from just a few weeks to 90 plus

23
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:14,929
we talked a lot about how she goes about

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,689
evaluating patients determining

25
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,118
formulations and dosing these patients

26
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:22,219
in our conversation we are excited to

27
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:23,959
have Bonnie as a keynote at cam at 2020

28
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:26,688
this year but that will not be the only

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,938
way she's contributing bonnie is also

30
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:32,389
leading a full day medical practicum

31
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:34,849
along with dr. Dustin Sulak dr. Kevin

32
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,460
Spellman and Eloise Thiessen who is a

33
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:38,780
board-certified NP this is a great

34
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:41,390
opportunity for healthcare professionals

35
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,239
to learn about the latest research into

36
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,189
cannabinoid therapies and also tap into

37
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,379
the deep clinical experience the

38
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:50,478
instructors have to offer when you

39
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:53,149
consider that most medical schools don't

40
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,069
teach the endocannabinoid system courses

41
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:57,170
like this are really the only way

42
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,478
healthcare providers can learn about how

43
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,118
to properly administer cannabinoid

44
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:04,158
therapies attendees will walk away with

45
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:05,930
practical information about the

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,660
different types of extractions and

47

92
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,009
conversation with dr. Bonnie goldstein

93
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:16,019
[Music]

94
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:20,579
good afternoon Bonnie thanks for joining

95
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,169
us thanks for having me first again I

96
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,810
want to thank you for taking the time to

97
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,780
join us today and what must be a hectic

98
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:31,790
time for you and your patients how has

99
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:35,250
this pandemic affected your practice

100
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:38,700
it's a great question so we've changed

101
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:43,319
from in-person appointments to all now

102
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,579
via telemedicine or telephone because we

103
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,279
certainly don't want to put anybody

104
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:50,219
who's sick at risk or even healthy

105
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:54,839
people at risk so we're we're following

106
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,990
socially social distancing and lockdown

107
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,519
I'm encouraging all my patients to try

108
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,819
as much as they count to limit their

109
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:06,329
exposure as you know I take care of many

110
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,639
sick children who have epilepsy autism

111
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:10,889
cancer all kinds of serious conditions

112
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,919
and certainly coronavirus would not be

113
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:15,930
something that would be a good thing for

114
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,040
them to get at this point so I'm hoping

115
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:24,449
everybody is staying home and just

116
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:27,510
hanging in there absolutely and has it

117
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:31,409
been more difficult to access cannabis

118
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:33,300
and get their medicine apart from people

119
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,380
just being fearful of going out and

120
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:41,520
having exposure it really has not been

121
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:44,009
California has deemed cannabis medicine

122
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,339
as essential and it is essential I have

123
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:49,620
children if they miss a dose of oil who

124
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,239
will have a terrible seizure and

125
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,149
potentially end up in the hospital and

126
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:59,400
potentially it could be deadly so this

127
00:05:54,149 --> 00:06:00,810
is not you know haphazard you know here

128
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,409
in their use of cannabis this is

129
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,209
medicine for so many of my patients and

130
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,189
so many Californians as well as in other

131
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:16,529
states and it's unfortunate that there

132
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:18,689
are people out there who think that this

133
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:20,669
is not necessary medicine but there are

134
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:24,569
people who just obviously are still

135
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:27,390
unenlightened as far as I can tell yeah

136
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,019
but fortunately in California and here

137
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,509
in mass

138
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,189
she sits where we're located too it's

139
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,900
great the cannabis has been deemed as

140
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:35,639
essential is that something you would

141
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,168
have expected when you first begin

142
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,930
treating your patients with cannabis

143
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:46,168
well yes because remember I'm on the

144
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,750
medical side I see people who are

145
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:50,969
usually in my office as a last resort

146
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,819
they've saw it every type of treatment

147
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,990
and they don't know why cannabis would

148
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,560
help them they don't know the science

149
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,280
behind it but they show up and ask you

150
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,139
know I really want to use this because

151
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,908
somebody told me it might help or I want

152
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,329
to try it or can you tell me more about

153
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:11,610
it

154
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:13,228
and so I knew about the medicinal

155
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,750
properties because you know my

156
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:18,089
experience but also reading the

157
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,339
scientific literature and following the

158
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:22,138
research that is ongoing and you know

159
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,728
it's a statement a lot of because

160
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,829
there's not enough research there's tons

161
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:28,529
of research you just have to read it and

162
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:30,870
learn about it and you know look or

163
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:33,809
there's three-day conferences about all

164
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,968
the research it's just there's a lot of

165
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,009
research and what we are missing is the

166
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:39,779
ability in the United States to do human

167
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:42,090
clinical trials but they are being done

168
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,929
elsewhere and they are certainly showing

169
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:47,788
that even if we don't get to the primary

170
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,069
endpoint that we might be seeking

171
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:53,098
meaning oh you know everybody has pain

172
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:55,408
relief or whatever we are certainly

173
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:58,519
seeing that it is safe and well

174
00:07:55,408 --> 00:08:02,490
tolerated and there's really no

175
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:04,109
increased danger with cannabis in fact

176
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,699
one of the things I tell people is over

177
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,949
and over again if you just go into the

178
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,569
scientific literature and just read the

179
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,330
clinical trials in humans what you will

180
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:14,490
see is it says well tolerated very

181
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:17,158
minimal side effects and unless they go

182
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,560
very very high dose and of course with

183
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:21,089
very high doses of anything you may push

184
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,699
into the world of side-effects but

185
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:26,788
usually with cannabis medicine you don't

186
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,218
need very high doses but anyway that

187
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:32,338
going back to this essential medicine

188
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:33,990
part of it it's an interesting thing

189
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,199
they're calling it an essential medicine

190
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:40,320
but yet California where I practice is

191
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:41,218
charging medical patients ridiculous

192
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,689
taxes

193
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,459
on their essential medicine so we now

194
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:49,588
have a little bit of a conflict and

195
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,719
maybe this can be something that we can

196
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,560
use after the pandemic kind of settles

197
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,319
down and we have a handle on it to

198
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:01,708
potentially protect medical patients

199
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:03,360
using cannabis from the tax burden

200
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,838
because you know if you think about

201
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,230
somebody who's ill they're not working

202
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,389
they might be on a fixed income and then

203
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,069
it's out of pocket certainly not covered

204
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:16,230
by insurance and then the state is

205
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:18,419
taxing them on top by the way the big

206
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,938
point here is that you do not pay taxes

207
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:23,278
on your other medications like your

208
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:25,338
pharmaceuticals those are not taxed so

209
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,688
why they're taxing medical patients is

210
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,550
beyond me and I feel that it's very

211
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:30,990
disingenuous to call it essential

212
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:33,599
medicine and then slap a whole bunch of

213
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,919
taxes on it yeah absolutely I would

214
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,350
think that that would be an opportunity

215
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,599
to get that changed to say that yeah

216
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,000
you're deeming it essential in the time

217
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,519
of a pandemic how about you deem it as

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,620
essential after the fact and removed

219
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,299
that tax I think I think that would be a

220
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,839
great thing a great change to come out

221
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:53,870
of all of this we're gonna work on it

222
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:56,250
excellent so I did want to talk about

223
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,289
the types of patients that you see in

224
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,730
your practice what are some of the

225
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:01,860
conditions and you mentioned that your

226
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,319
your treating children what are some of

227
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,680
the typical ages who's typically coming

228
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:09,419
to see you so in terms of age group you

229
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,638
know my youngest patient is six months

230
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:13,708
old or sorry six weeks old when he

231
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:17,220
presented he had a genetic syndrome that

232
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:19,078
caused terrible seizures and even the

233
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,670
physician taking care of the patient was

234
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,138
on board with cannabis because he had

235
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:24,088
seen this syndrome before and knew that

236
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,100
the medications that are currently

237
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,689
available for seizures in that

238
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,970
particular instance were not very

239
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:32,698
effective and then my oldest patient

240
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,079
almost about a hundred I have colleagues

241
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:38,698
who have patients who are even older

242
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:40,258
than that 100 and 305 so in terms of age

243
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:43,139
you know we all have into an

244
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:45,539
endocannabinoid system so it really

245
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,519
doesn't matter how old you are there's

246
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:51,838
no real contraindication in terms of age

247
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,938
to use cannabis mostly I you know I do

248
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,110
specialize in Pediatrics because that

249
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:59,069
was my background

250
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,750
a pediatric trained physician and I did

251
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,190
pediatric emergency medicine for many

252
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:06,708
years so I'm comfortable with sick

253
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:11,279
children and and helping kids who have

254
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:13,099
complex medical conditions in children

255
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,708
I'd say the most common conditions are

256
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:20,250
treatment-resistant epilepsy autism

257
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:23,359
cancer GI disorders like Crohn's disease

258
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:26,039
ulcerative colitis autoimmune disease a

259
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,169
lot of genetic syndromes that have

260
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:35,000
either medical or behavioral components

261
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:37,828
to them so really it runs the gamut in

262
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,980
Pediatrics and then in adults you know

263
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:43,708
obviously there's a lot of conditions

264
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:47,459
that we see but they're the top three

265
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:50,489
are paying chronic pain anxiety

266
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:53,989
depression and then also insomnia and

267
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,639
remember those three often run together

268
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,350
if you have chronic pain you're probably

269
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,269
not sleeping great and you have some

270
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,610
anxiety and depression right if you have

271
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,409
anxiety and depression sometimes you

272
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,409
have other medical conditions where pain

273
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:10,860
plays a big role and then sleep is huge

274
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:14,309
I mean so many people struggling with

275
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,959
sleep the sleep industry is multi

276
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:17,879
billion dollars in the United States

277
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:22,049
between pharmaceuticals and other other

278
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:24,240
treatments and I do find that about 90%

279
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:27,509
or even a little bit more than that of

280
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:31,470
patients that will try cannabis report

281
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:33,328
and improvement and sleep well okay a

282
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,009
few things I wanted to unpack with that

283
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:37,109
the first being that I didn't realize

284
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:40,588
you had such a wide range of Ages that

285
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:44,070
you were treating it makes me curious

286
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:46,620
how does endocannabinoid function change

287
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,339
with age is there sort of a time where

288
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,860
it where it falls off in older folks

289
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:54,839
yeah great question so in children they

290
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,440
have an immature like everything about a

291
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,510
child's body and nervous system and

292
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,610
brain is immature right I mean they're

293
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:04,289
babies and they're then they're growing

294
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,600
and school-aged and then into teenage

295
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:08,319
years and they're constantly changing me

296
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,389
think about someone

297
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,379
born yesterday and 18 years from now

298
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,909
completely different humans so it's

299
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:19,480
important to understand that the

300
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:21,879
endocannabinoid system is present at the

301
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,430
beginning of life and through fetal

302
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,590
growth and then as there during infancy

303
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:28,719
and so on and it goes through changes

304
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,570
and the levels of endocannabinoids

305
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,690
andrás and the cannabinoid receptors are

306
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:37,060
all changing and are somewhat different

307
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:40,120
we find it's very counterintuitive but

308
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:43,509
it appears from some research that

309
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,610
children are less sensitive to the

310
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:47,110
effects of THC than adults and you would

311
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,019
think oh my gosh they're little they

312
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,759
would be more sensitive but they're not

313
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,649
they're they seem to be less sensitive

314
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,360
to the intoxicating effects and that's

315
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,899
because they're endocannabinoid system

316
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,149
is quite immature and they have probably

317
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:04,120
less density of cannabinoid type 1

318
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:06,519
receptors where THC interacts and causes

319
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,350
the intoxicating effects and then as

320
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:13,210
people age their endocannabinoid system

321
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:15,100
it's been shown starts to for lack of a

322
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,509
better word atrophy and it you know and

323
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,430
somebody we think about somebody who's

324
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:20,409
old how their muscles kind of their

325
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:22,509
muscle mass goes down we know brain

326
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:24,789
starts to shrink as you get older and

327
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:29,950
very similar their endocannabinoid

328
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:31,629
system starts to deteriorate I mean

329
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:35,350
that's maybe a strong word for it but it

330
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:39,759
does start to succumb to the aging

331
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:42,580
process and certainly what we know are

332
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:46,269
endocannabinoid system to do is to play

333
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:49,300
a very well described protective role

334
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:52,179
and so as somebody ages I really believe

335
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:54,399
that they should have support and

336
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:57,359
augmentation of their endocannabinoid

337
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,819
system through using cannabinoids to

338
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,720
help continue the protective process as

339
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:08,290
they get older well that's interesting

340
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,840
about children being less sensitive to

341
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:15,459
THC is that the same with other

342
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:18,480
cannabinoids like CBD well remember THC

343
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:22,150
is the one that works directly at the

344
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,310
has THC has multiple targets let's

345
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:27,490
say in the body but it's the one that

346
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:29,489
binds directly to the cannabinoid

347
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,200
receptor giving the well-known effects

348
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,240
CBD has some action within the

349
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,090
endocannabinoid system but it has many

350
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,970
many actions what we call non

351
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:42,820
cannabinoid system mechanisms of action

352
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:45,910
so it targets many other receptors and

353
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:50,320
many other locations enzymes

354
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:51,939
transporters in the body so ID 1 I don't

355
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,670
know that it's been researched in terms

356
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,460
of sensitivity to CBD but in a way you

357
00:15:54,669 --> 00:16:00,159
almost would not necessarily be able to

358
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,920
know because you don't always see

359
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,969
immediate effects from CBD right you can

360
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:05,529
give it and somebody says oh I don't

361
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,340
feel anything but meanwhile it's doing

362
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,199
something you know it's

363
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,800
anti-inflammatory antioxidant neuro

364
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,020
protective

365
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:14,109
anti epilepsy but they may say well I

366
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:15,909
don't feel it meaning the same as most

367
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,960
people who take THC will tell you oh I

368
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:22,839
feel it right so it may be difficult to

369
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,389
assess but I do find that young children

370
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,389
who let's say going through cancer

371
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,970
treatment or going through who have

372
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:33,429
epilepsy when we give them THC that

373
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,970
might a dose that might intoxicate an

374
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:38,259
adult they you know we stay in very

375
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,149
close touch with the parents I always

376
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:42,129
tell them there's what I call the

377
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,480
sealing dose and the sealing dose of THC

378
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:46,149
is the dose at which you feel

379
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,680
intoxicated and even though a child may

380
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:49,120
not be able to describe that I will tell

381
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,729
you parents know their children very

382
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,200
well and they'll call me and say my

383
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,940
child's eyes are a little red he looked

384
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,780
a little glassy seems kind of mellow

385
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,730
okay

386
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,309
we've probably hit the ceiling dose and

387
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,590
it's surprising though in these young

388
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:04,559
children just what that dose is because

389
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,910
many of my adult patients may not even

390
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,069
be able to get to that dose because

391
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,870
their ceiling dose is so much lower so

392
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,299
not everybody and again there's always

393
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,129
outliers we must understand that

394
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,759
everybody's endocannabinoid system is

395
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:21,280
different to genetically programmed and

396
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:24,069
determined and how we react to

397
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:27,039
cannabinoids is very individual there's

398
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:28,869
similarities of course but you know what

399
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,519
I'm talking about with children is we

400
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:32,259
can't just you know look and people will

401
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,849
say oh well what about all the overdoses

402
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,190
that you know all these hospitals may

403
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:36,959
see well because if you leave your

404
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,529
edible that has a hundred milligrams

405
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,150
laying around of course a child if they

406
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:44,069
ate a hundred milligrams are going to be

407
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:49,650
intoxicated I'm talking about low

408
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:52,429
medicinal doses yeah so let's get into

409
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,620
dosing in first I wanted to ask you

410
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:58,320
where do you sort of come down on the

411
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:59,969
the debate or the divide between sort of

412
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:03,419
whole plant medicine versus like

413
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:06,089
isolated compounds well look as

414
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:09,630
scientists and researchers we must know

415
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:13,139
what isolated compounds do so I want to

416
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,990
know what does CBD do as what what is

417
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:19,020
CBD responsible for so before you can

418
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,370
make any treatment plan for somebody you

419
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:25,319
have to know what these how these

420
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:27,419
compounds work and so it's important

421
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:31,980
that people understand that yes in

422
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:36,840
research we use isolated compounds to

423
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,730
understand the mechanisms of action and

424
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:43,259
the therapeutic benefits or detriments

425
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:47,039
of phyto cannabinoids but there are is a

426
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:50,420
nice body of research that shows that

427
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:54,240
these compounds clearly work together

428
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:58,259
enhancing each other but also minimizing

429
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,930
some of the potential unwanted effects

430
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:04,980
for instance CBD can buffer a little you

431
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:08,160
know some of the high from THC almost

432
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:13,309
what we call antagonists they have

433
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:16,050
opposite effects at the receptor and so

434
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:23,429
knowing that we can use that to up to

435
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:26,460
our benefit so what's important hang on

436
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:29,190
one second sorry so what's important to

437
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,370
understand about that is that even

438
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:37,320
though a study might show isolated CBD

439
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:39,179
did X Y &amp; Z in the study if we use whole

440
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,389
plant which I will share with you I

441
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,160
always encourage whole plant why would I

442
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,290
remove medicinal compounds from

443
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,790
somebody's plant and everybody would say

444
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:48,940
oh it's medicine you should control it

445
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,368
and all of that well yeah

446
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,558
there's a lot of companies now that have

447
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:56,499
very consistent medicine batch to batch

448
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:59,440
if I test the bottles batch to batch I

449
00:19:56,499 --> 00:20:02,348
see they're very similar and I can use

450
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,999
those as medicine because I'm following

451
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:06,999
the patients closely and I see what the

452
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:10,179
medicine is doing for them and you have

453
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:12,579
to know what each cannabinoid can do and

454
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:14,470
then you have to be able to understand

455
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:17,138
what happens when they kind of work

456
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:20,098
together and one of the things that I

457
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:24,038
had to kind of come around to as a

458
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:26,798
scientist was that there is always gonna

459
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:28,538
be some small level of unknown when

460
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,308
you're using whole plant that somebody

461
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:32,888
might be sensitive to something else

462
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:36,220
that's in the bottle but if it doesn't

463
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:37,449
fit them or suit them we sometimes try

464
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,149
different things and then we try to

465
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,470
narrow in on maybe this did work for you

466
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:42,908
and this didn't work for you what does

467
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,399
this bottle have that this bottle

468
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,590
doesn't have right so you try to be

469
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:51,308
scientific about it and try to narrow it

470
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:54,128
down but studies show that whole plant

471
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:59,168
seems to have higher efficacy than

472
00:20:54,128 --> 00:21:02,439
isolated compounds no I liked that

473
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:05,499
response very very diplomatic that you

474
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,820
know we know that that we get a lot of

475
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:09,759
benefit out of the whole plant but there

476
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:11,378
still is very much a need to be studying

477
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,769
the isolated compounds so I think that

478
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:16,928
is a nice balance between the two so but

479
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:19,388
I'm curious when and just in your

480
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:21,429
approach in in treating patients is

481
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:29,408
there a certain sort of blend of

482
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:32,950
cannabinoids and terpenoids how do you

483
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:35,019
sort of go about that so that's a loaded

484
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,149
question because like oh I get a lot of

485
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:38,979
families or people that ask me which

486
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:41,439
what's the best CBD what's the best

487
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:42,940
medicine and the answer is the best

488
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,070
medicine is the one that works for you

489
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,778
and it may be different for you than it

490
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:49,598
is for me even though we have the same

491
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:52,450
condition and that's because what we're

492
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:56,858
trying to do is take a plant that has

493
00:21:52,450 --> 00:22:00,159
over 500 different compounds I II a very

494
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:01,859
complex product of mother nature and I'm

495
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,190
trying to

496
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:10,889
Matchett - you're extremely complex

497
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:13,230
physiology and particular let's say team

498
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,540
of our chemical variety of plant ie

499
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,069
strain which I try not to use that word

500
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,259
because it's not really accurate the

501
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:23,189
word is keema var chemical variety of

502
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:25,259
plant that works for your arthritis may

503
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,360
not work for my arthritis why Bowl

504
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,089
because again your DNA is different from

505
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,119
my DNA your response your absorption the

506
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:34,139
way you metabolize the way you excrete

507
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:37,469
chemicals from your body is very

508
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:41,220
different from the way that I do

509
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:43,169
if you've ever talked to someone who has

510
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,700
been successful using cannabis they'll

511
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,040
tell you I had to try a number of

512
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,190
products to really narrow down on what

513
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,319
worked for me Park let's take

514
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:55,620
Parkinson's disease so Parkinson's is a

515
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:58,859
neurodegenerative disorder and the

516
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:00,659
beginning of Parkinson's the course of

517
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,000
illness is different than the middle

518
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,980
than the end so when somebody says to me

519
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,529
what do you use for Parkinson's well you

520
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,470
know where is the person in their course

521
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:12,089
right are they just diagnosed are they

522
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,160
ten years in or they twenty years in

523
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:16,500
what are their most symptoms that

524
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,259
they're trying to address how old are

525
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,109
they do the can they tolerate THC do

526
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:25,950
they not want THC in their in their mix

527
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:29,009
there's a so much to determining what

528
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,630
works for somebody and that's why you

529
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:33,298
can't necessarily just walk into a

530
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,919
dispensary and say oh I have X disease

531
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:37,889
what should I take and then somebody

532
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:41,100
hands you and says oh use this you might

533
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:43,950
get lucky and it works hey great but if

534
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:45,779
it doesn't work you have must understand

535
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,730
that this is not cookie cutter it's not

536
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:49,950
one-size-fits-all I get all the time

537
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,470
what ratio should my child be on for

538
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,830
epilepsy that there is no

539
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:58,589
one-size-fits-all for that it's

540
00:23:54,829 --> 00:24:01,259
absolutely ridiculous to think that this

541
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:03,240
complex plan and your complex physiology

542
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:05,099
is gonna be you know as they say

543
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,179
one-size-fits-all it just does not work

544
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:10,049
that way yeah I imagine that's got to be

545
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,800
difficult

546
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:15,778
are there certain certain traits certain

547
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,538
markers that you commonly see that

548
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:22,469
know that oh I imagine that this person

549
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:25,019
might benefit from Luna loool or any of

550
00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:27,739
the particular terpenes or or

551
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:32,460
cannabinoids that you've just sort of

552
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:34,200
gathered in your experience yes so let's

553
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,009
say take a child with autism for

554
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,778
instance so we know autism is a

555
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:41,700
condition where the brain is

556
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:44,038
overly excited what we call neuro

557
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,499
excitation same thing with epilepsy the

558
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:47,960
brain is overly excited and what's

559
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:49,889
happening is you're getting

560
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,139
neurotransmitters right the chemical

561
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:55,199
messengers in your brain are sending

562
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:58,378
messages that aren't always adaptive and

563
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,749
and correct and so we're trying to tell

564
00:24:58,378 --> 00:25:03,298
those neurotransmitters you know dial it

565
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:05,608
down I use the analogy like someone who

566
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:09,148
many of the kids with autism are just a

567
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:10,949
lot of parents will acknowledge this

568
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:13,278
like I call it it's a it's a Ferrari

569
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,509
flying down the freeway with no brakes

570
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,009
okay and we don't want to stop the

571
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:19,169
Ferrari what we want is the Ferrari to

572
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:21,899
go speed limit right we want to just

573
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:24,599
balance and obviously neuro excitation

574
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:26,819
is out of balance it's the out of

575
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:28,319
balance message if your bear is chasing

576
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:30,269
you yes you want your brain to be

577
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,450
overexcited fight-or-flight but not in

578
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:35,579
just everyday function so many of those

579
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,909
kids have been shown to respond to the

580
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:40,949
calming terpenes like lynn Elul the

581
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:45,479
anti-inflammatory terpenes like beta

582
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:47,249
carry off one there's a terpene pine een

583
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:49,379
which can help with focus and

584
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:51,509
concentration and learning and some

585
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:54,238
people find that to be very helpful for

586
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:56,278
their child with autism again ultimately

587
00:25:54,239 --> 00:26:00,479
what we're trying to do is take this

588
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:02,759
really large amount of products that are

589
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:05,239
out there and narrow them down to fit

590
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:08,808
that specific person that we're treating

591
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:11,759
but we can start with using our

592
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:14,009
knowledge about these compounds to say

593
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,319
hey let's start here and by the way this

594
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:19,348
is what doctors are doing all the time

595
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,239
if you came in to my office let's say if

596
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:23,939
I was a regular doctor practicing

597
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:27,028
medicine I have a handful of tools in my

598
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,830
toolbox ie the pharmaceuticals and using

599
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:31,380
my knowledge my clinical

600
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:33,509
experience the research and kind of

601
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,970
trying to make the best educated guess

602
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:39,109
that I can make let me pick this drug

603
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:41,308
and tell you to take it right and

604
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:42,869
sometimes I'm gonna get lucky and it's

605
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,879
gonna be the perfect match and the

606
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:47,069
perfect fit and you're gonna say wow my

607
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,679
doctor was great she knew exactly what

608
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:51,058
to give to me and sometimes by the way

609
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,759
which has happened to me

610
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:55,558
you take one dose and say there is no

611
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,720
way in hell I'm taking another dose of

612
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:00,750
that and you call your doctor and say oh

613
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,610
my gosh you know like I'm thinking I

614
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,859
need to go to the ER after I took that

615
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:06,479
pill I've been on the end of that once

616
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:09,058
in my life and that once was enough

617
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,889
and I remember calling the doctor and

618
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:12,418
the doctor on call was not my doctor he

619
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:13,798
said gee I wonder why he started with

620
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,230
that one which did not instill any

621
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,599
confidence of course but at the same

622
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,058
time you're you're making the best guess

623
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:22,678
you can until somebody takes something

624
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,398
you just do not know how they're gonna

625
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,409
respond

626
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:28,768
the beauty of cannabis is that you're

627
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:30,419
not going to be harmed you might now if

628
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:32,880
it's got a lot of THC and you have an

629
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,009
unpleasant like you know THC overdose

630
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,750
experience where you get too intoxicated

631
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:38,849
and you get paranoid and anxious and you

632
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,589
freak out a little you still won't die

633
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:42,148
from that so it's okay and you're

634
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:43,470
probably not going to end up in an ER if

635
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:45,449
you get some reassurance that you're

636
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,819
gonna be fine and it's gonna wear off

637
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,558
but the reality is is cannabis is

638
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:52,168
extremely safe too

639
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:54,089
trial and error and for many of my

640
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:55,980
patients the reason I'm able to help

641
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:58,528
them is they're willing to hang in there

642
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,288
with me as we methodically approach a

643
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:03,898
trial and error way of doing this

644
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:06,419
because again look there was a study out

645
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:09,629
of Israel that took 60 kids with severe

646
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:13,470
behavioral issues as part of their

647
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:15,960
autism and 50% of them responded

648
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,389
basically 50% responded to a 20 to 1

649
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,548
ratio CBD to THC well what about the

650
00:28:18,388 --> 00:28:24,509
other 50% you know that's a crapshoot

651
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:26,369
right the other the other 50% about half

652
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:29,028
of them little slightly more than half

653
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:31,619
responded to adding in a little more THC

654
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:34,019
so often that's the approaches let's

655
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:35,819
start with this and then we can add

656
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,259
something in if your child looks like

657
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:39,089
it's not gonna your child's not going to

658
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:42,629
be the one that's in that responder

659
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:44,669
category so anybody using counter

660
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,560
we're serious illness has to kind of

661
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,960
accept the fact and I tell everybody you

662
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,549
must be patient you must understand that

663
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,350
probably for the first three to six

664
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:54,089
months you're gonna be doing trial and

665
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:56,189
error that is just part of it and you

666
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:58,439
may get very lucky and the first product

667
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,610
out of the bet out of the gate helps you

668
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,799
that's terrific

669
00:28:59,609 --> 00:29:03,750
but sometimes that's not how it works

670
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:05,960
and so hanging in there and just getting

671
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:09,809
some good advice and trialing things is

672
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,480
pretty much standard it's par for the

673
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:15,359
course

674
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,980
now what about delivery method I hear

675
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,389
you saying bottles a lot is a lot of

676
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,000
oils and tint shoes that you're

677
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,190
recommending I am and one of the reasons

678
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,079
is because you can really control the

679
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:30,900
dosing right so if you buy an edible

680
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,730
let's say right and let's say the edible

681
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,920
has got 10 milligrams and you cut it

682
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,630
into let's say a little piece of I don't

683
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,340
know a chocolate and you cut it into

684
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,410
four pieces you can go as low as two

685
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:42,209
point five milligrams and then maybe you

686
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:45,000
could cut that piece again in half and

687
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,829
get a low dose but with oils I can

688
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,900
measure out a half a milligram of THC

689
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:51,539
which can be medicinal for some people

690
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,640
you want to be able to titrate what we

691
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:56,879
call titrate dosing to be able to start

692
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,800
with very tiny doses and go up if cap

693
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,690
let's say you bought THC capsules and

694
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,269
they only come in 25 milligrams but

695
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,250
you're a dose you figured out somehow

696
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:07,200
that your dose is 15 milligrams well the

697
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:11,400
capsule comes is 25 how are you taking

698
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,519
15 so I find that initial in especially

699
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,470
initially again if if we don't get the

700
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,240
if we can get the dose right then we can

701
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:22,680
look at what products allow for that

702
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,970
dosing so obviously inhaling is not

703
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,710
something that we do a lot with

704
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,370
pediatric patients there are some

705
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:31,650
parents using like a type of vaporizer

706
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,389
where it has a bag and then you can put

707
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,910
a little mask over the child's face so

708
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:38,160
for some kids who have severe rage and

709
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,990
aggression as part of their syndrome or

710
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,050
as part of autism or whatever it is they

711
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:45,420
have they are using that vape in those

712
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,859
cases they're not really medicating by

713
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,480
that because the other thing with

714
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:50,069
children is that children grow and you

715
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,309
have to be able to increase the dose

716
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:54,720
based on their weight and as they you

717
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,730
don't want them to outgrow the dose

718
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,069
that's very typical for any medicine

719
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:01,440
attrex most most medicines are based on

720
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:03,899
weight in the pediatric world for adults

721
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,500
though I find that having liquids that

722
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:10,169
you can titrate you know a quarter of a

723
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:13,349
dropper to a half a dropper for instance

724
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:16,380
0.25 milligrams to 0.5 0.5 s too much

725
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:21,000
and 0.25 s not enough you can use a

726
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,799
little syringe to measure out 0.3 or 0.4

727
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,109
it just allows you to kind of really

728
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,690
narrow in on dosing does everybody need

729
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:29,639
that no just some people need that not

730
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,009
everybody needs it but I do like

731
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,450
tinctures for that particular reason the

732
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:36,058
other thing that tinctures is that you

733
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,769
can hide the flavor in food you can

734
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:39,539
actually buy empty capsules and make

735
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:42,150
your own capsules so that if you can't

736
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:44,519
find that the dose you're looking for

737
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:50,009
you can make your own so it just allows

738
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:53,069
for a lot of it's very easy to work with

739
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:55,589
however edibles are great you know

740
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:57,539
vaporizers sure I'm all in board with

741
00:31:55,589 --> 00:32:00,539
those I also encourage people to use

742
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:03,480
topicals so there is no again no

743
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:05,730
delivery method that is better than any

744
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,039
other I just think as a physician who's

745
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:11,039
trying to dial in dosing for people and

746
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:14,759
to find that sweet spot especially in a

747
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:17,609
you know population of children who are

748
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:18,929
growing and changing who sometimes you

749
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:20,399
know they're nonverbal and you don't

750
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:28,290
know what's going on you want to be able

751
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:30,360
to make changes simply great and we're

752
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:33,349
coming up on the end here but I did want

753
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:36,240
to ask you do you have any idea how many

754
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:38,159
physicians out there are like you well

755
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:44,660
not like you because there's no one like

756
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:47,058
you know but but position but pediatric

757
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,070
clinicians who are actually treating

758
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:52,798
children with cannabis are there a lot

759
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:55,439
of a lot of them out there and how does

760
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,529
one find one right so unfortunately no

761
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,419
there are a lot of cannabis doctors that

762
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:02,460
will treat children who may not have had

763
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:05,340
specific training with pediatrics and I

764
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,500
do think that because cannabis is so

765
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:09,029
safe that you're they're not going to

766
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
harm anybody but whether or not they

767
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,750
understand the nuances

768
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,339
treating a child you know after working

769
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,140
with children for so many years there's

770
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,970
definitely some nuances there it's not

771
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:22,380
it's not just a small adult that's for

772
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:25,169
sure but I think there's probably less

773
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,390
than ten of us in the whole country that

774
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,669
are specifically pediatric trained I

775
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,679
know of a handful on the East Coast or a

776
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:34,049
few on the East Coast I know of a doctor

777
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,788
in Florida I think there's a couple in

778
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:40,139
Colorado and of course there may be

779
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:42,240
others and not to discount them but you

780
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,650
know there's really not very many of us

781
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,370
and I think part of it is that it's

782
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:49,919
still considered controversial I

783
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:52,168
recently gave Grand Rounds at a local

784
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,490
Children's Hospital and the doctor who

785
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:55,230
introduced me said you know this is very

786
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,120
controversial and I thought I've been

787
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:01,380
doing this for so long and so to me it's

788
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:04,288
not controversial at all we you children

789
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,760
have an endocannabinoid system we have

790
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:08,190
some understanding that there's

791
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,409
dysregulation or deficiency within that

792
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,530
endocannabinoid system for for sure with

793
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:15,780
epilepsy autism maybe with ADHD that

794
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,389
research is is being done in other

795
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,909
countries and you would never leave a

796
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:24,119
child with a deficiency of any other

797
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:26,250
necessary chemical in their body like

798
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,639
you would like what do we call insulin

799
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:31,199
deficiency like type 1 diabetes is an

800
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,480
insulin deficiency and what do we give

801
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,250
those people we give them insulin if you

802
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,539
have no thyroid deficiency you have

803
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:41,699
what's called hypothyroidism so we now

804
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:44,099
know that children with autism based on

805
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:45,779
two studies one out of Stanford

806
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,330
University and one out of Israel show

807
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,419
that children with autism have low

808
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:52,500
levels of their natural what we call

809
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:55,289
endocannabinoid their inner cannabis

810
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:58,079
compounds which serve a protective role

811
00:34:55,289 --> 00:35:00,719
of regulating the brain chemistry and

812
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,500
here now we have a population of kids

813
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:07,379
who have dysregulated behaviors that's

814
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:11,250
their brain chemistry not balanced

815
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:13,530
why wouldn't we fix the imbalance right

816
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,199
now I'm not saying more research isn't

817
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,880
needed but you know I've treated so many

818
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,618
patients when parents say my child can

819
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,260
go back to school my child's the

820
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:24,240
aggression is gone we are no longer

821
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,440
living in fear of our ten-year-old

822
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:31,259
that's huge and when we look at downside

823
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,358
I will I always say I point to the

824
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,920
patients ask the parents they will tell

825
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,190
you whether or not they're seeing side

826
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,769
effects and all that kind of thing so to

827
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:43,050
me it's not controversial and to me this

828
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:45,449
is again just another tool in the

829
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:48,150
toolbox and we are smart enough to

830
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:51,799
understand this we're smart enough to do

831
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:54,088
the research right now we should

832
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,400
continue to move forward so we

833
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:58,799
understand more we should not you know

834
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,510
there's why and many people say why is

835
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,710
there a ban on research look ultimately

836
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,050
it comes down to money

837
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,789
the only reason cannabis is being kept

838
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:09,660
as a Schedule one is because it can

839
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:11,608
replace lots of pharmaceuticals and you

840
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:14,219
know that doesn't help the

841
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:16,588
pharmaceutical company so my my point

842
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:18,118
being that what is everybody afraid of

843
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:20,369
let's just do the research so we can

844
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,200
finally know so when somebody comes to

845
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:23,849
me and says is cannabis gonna help my

846
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:25,230
child with this rare syndrome wouldn't

847
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,609
it be nice if I could tell them whether

848
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:30,809
or not they should spend their money on

849
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:35,219
this mm-hmm well I didn't realize the

850
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:38,400
number of pediatric clinicians using

851
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:40,709
cannabis was so low so what is your

852
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,450
advice to parents who maybe have a child

853
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:46,639
they think could benefit from cannabis

854
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:49,169
but don't have access to to one of those

855
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:53,489
where do they start well so some of us

856
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:55,500
do educational consults where we're just

857
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:58,769
educating the parent or kind of where to

858
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,679
begin there are some resources online

859
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:03,599
there's a website that's it's a

860
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,039
nonprofit that I work with them on their

861
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,019
advisory board called the whole plan

862
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:11,250
access for autism

863
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:15,358
it's WPA for a.com

864
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:17,789
there's project CBD org that's a

865
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:22,679
nonprofit that people can turn to to try

866
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:24,480
to find a referral or you know find a

867
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:26,069
doctor that's cannabis friendly there

868
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,750
luckily we're moving in the right

869
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,250
direction and they're more doctors that

870
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,079
are learning about this and are starting

871
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,400
to incorporate it into their practice so

872
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,098
at least we're moving in the right

873
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,789
direction but you may have to seek out

874
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:40,740
somebody who's able to do a telemedicine

875
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:42,269
consultation if you can't find somebody

876
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:44,519
in your state and of course you should

877
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:46,230
always just take a look online and see

878
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:47,849
if you can make sure what your state

879
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,570
allows for so that you're not getting

880
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:54,000
into trouble making sure that you are

881
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:55,620
following the rules because certainly we

882
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,230
don't want anybody's child getting taken

883
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:00,539
away for trying cannabis or using

884
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:04,429
cannabis when their state laws don't

885
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:06,929
allow it again we should have a federal

886
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:09,449
leadership on this but right now we it's

887
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:13,500
state-by-state but you're allowed to

888
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:14,879
give your child so right well thank you

889
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,679
for those resources I'll definitely put

890
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,320
some links in the show notes so people

891
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:21,509
can check those out so I know we're

892
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,970
coming up on the end here and I did want

893
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,190
to talk about can Med of course what's

894
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:27,929
kind of what brought us here and correct

895
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,970
me if I'm wrong but you've been at all

896
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:32,690
of the kid meds right you've been with

897
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:35,339
us each year I have since the beginning

898
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,769
that's great and we're so happy to have

899
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,019
you as a keynote presenter at this

900
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:41,369
year's event I was wondering if you

901
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:43,009
might want to give us a little preview

902
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:48,509
of what you're going to be presenting on

903
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:51,690
I think I'm just sharing you know my

904
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:54,950
findings and kind of going over what the

905
00:38:51,690 --> 00:39:01,170
latest research is in terms of

906
00:38:54,949 --> 00:39:04,730
pediatrics and how patients my patients

907
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:07,769
are responding to various cannabinoids

908
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:10,409
everybody's focused on THC and CBD and

909
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:12,059
certainly I focus on those two but

910
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:20,190
there's other cannabinoids that we are

911
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:21,960
using CBG THC a CBD a and now just

912
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:26,849
coming out on the market in California

913
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:29,159
our THC v tetrahydrocannabinol you can

914
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:32,460
óbuda varam which all have again their

915
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:34,649
own medicinal properties and it's

916
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,380
important for people to understand that

917
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:42,050
there is not just one way or one ratio

918
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,050
or one product there's many different

919
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,650
compounds that we can

920
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,769
and use therapeutically to address

921
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,180
illness and again this goes back to

922
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:55,309
right if you're not a big responder to

923
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:56,690
just CBD THC combination is there

924
00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:00,170
something else that the plant offers

925
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:02,240
that you can try and you know for every

926
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,820
patient of mine that does well on CBD or

927
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,619
THC there's those that don't even take

928
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,110
those cannabinoids and they're using

929
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:11,059
other cannabinoids so I think I'll be

930
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:13,640
talking about that I haven't written I

931
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:15,110
haven't gotten the talk together yet so

932
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:17,029
I you know sometimes it takes you to

933
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,769
other places and certainly what's

934
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:25,460
fascinating too is that between now a

935
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:27,710
preliminary search and so you know

936
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:30,980
sometimes I'm literally putting together

937
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,929
something a week before that is new and

938
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,900
this is a very exciting time to be in

939
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:38,419
this industry yeah absolutely

940
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,760
and as as the person on the team who

941
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,289
usually has to put the put the slides

942
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,060
together and get everything ready for

943
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:47,900
the production team you're not the only

944
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:50,289
one who waits inside you try to get it

945
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:53,829
in early but sometimes these wonderful

946
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:57,139
cases or good results or even a

947
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:58,699
groundbreaking research that that just

948
00:40:57,139 --> 00:41:00,230
gets published and you'd want to include

949
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:02,269
it because you want to keep people and

950
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:04,130
you want to be cutting edge and leading

951
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:07,009
edge you don't want to you know in this

952
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,050
in this crazy world of cannabis

953
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,610
you know I joke around that like one

954
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,010
year is equal to like seven dog years

955
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:16,130
right because there's so much that you

956
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:17,990
think so many things change and again

957
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,300
it's such an active area research all

958
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:23,209
around the world that you have to really

959
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:25,930
stay on top of it in order to be able to

960
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:28,490
be on to be have the latest and greatest

961
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:30,139
yeah absolutely and that's why we love

962
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:31,819
having this event every year so we can

963
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:34,190
we can get the latest and greatest and

964
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,559
get everyone together to share their

965
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:41,179
information and we love having you a

966
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:44,360
part of it so before we go is there any

967
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:46,009
other any other information you want to

968
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,480
share in terms of how people can either

969
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,700
get in touch with you or follow what

970
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,219
you're doing whether it be website

971
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:56,219
social media sure so we have a Facebook

972
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:59,129
page it's canna Centers

973
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:03,000
you can look for Kanna - centers and

974
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:07,829
then I have an Instagram which is Bonnie

975
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,599
goldstein MD and I don't over post but I

976
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:11,519
try to put things on Facebook that are

977
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,019
good articles that I come across in the

978
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,460
scientific literature that I think

979
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:19,280
should get out there you know there's

980
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:22,199
this finding that it takes 17 years for

981
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,269
article of scientific information to

982
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:28,139
trickle down to doctors which is like

983
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:29,639
blows my mind because but remember if

984
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:31,259
you're a busy practice you're taking

985
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:33,989
care of patients you're taking care of

986
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:36,450
your business and you're you're you know

987
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:38,039
you're deep in it's very hard to keep up

988
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:40,219
with the research so I try really hard

989
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:44,608
to make sure I post articles that are

990
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:46,409
again some of the latest information

991
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:48,630
that can be helpful to people and it's

992
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:50,819
meaningful to people and then on

993
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:53,190
Instagram I just often share stories of

994
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,559
my patients or you know reposts of

995
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:58,289
patients who are getting success because

996
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:03,358
people we we are fighting also

997
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:05,670
propaganda and fear of cannabis and what

998
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,460
people need to realize is that under

999
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:11,430
medical supervision cannabis is

1000
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:14,309
extremely safe I joke around that I'm a

1001
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:17,069
chicken inside I am I am a very

1002
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:18,539
conservative doctor overall and for me

1003
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,609
to be able to feel comfortable with

1004
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:23,150
cannabis I will tell you it is extremely

1005
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:25,858
safe my elderly parents take cannabis

1006
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,329
for their conditions and I would never

1007
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:28,319
let them take anything that I would

1008
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:30,329
think that would harm them and I

1009
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,430
certainly wouldn't recommend cannabis to

1010
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:35,369
children if it wasn't safe so I just

1011
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:37,799
think people need to realize that this

1012
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:39,930
kind of party line we were dealt with

1013
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,750
you know we were handed a long time ago

1014
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:44,969
that oh it's dangerous and it kills

1015
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:48,269
brain cells and it's gonna do all these

1016
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:50,509
terrible things it's just baloney I

1017
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:52,769
think that's a great way to close it out

1018
