1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
So, we had a customer that was in

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,838
desperate need of tic soy broth and we

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
had a couple hiccups that were out of

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,679
our control and getting it to them,

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,400
weather issues and whatnot. Um, we were

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,879
actually out at the moment. So, I had

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,080
gotten some from our R&amp;D team, was able

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,519
to get the order together, but

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,679
unfortunately our FedEx guy had already

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,118
came and went. So, I bounced around

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,960
between a couple different FedEx

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,399
locations. And after some trials and

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,320
tribulations and getting everything

14
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,479
straightened out, the only FedEx

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
location left was at Logan Airport in

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,679
Boston. So, I get there with about an

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,320
hour to spare, thinking everything's all

18
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:38,159
set. I walk in, she goes, "You know, you

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
printed the shipping label out, uh,

20
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,679
landscape instead of portrait, so I

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,200
can't scan it. If I can't scan it, I

22
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,119
can't ship it." And I go, "Okay, no

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
problem." I run to my car real quick. I

24
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,280
come back in, sitting on the floor at

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
FedEx on my laptop, revising it,

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
changing the shipping labels from

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,399
landscape to portrait. And then I ask

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
her, you know, what's the wireless

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,759
network here so I can email you these?

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,039
And she says, you know, there's no

31
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,599
wireless network. They're all hard

32
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,960
hardwired there. So I go, "Okay." So

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,359
then I'm trying to connect to the hot

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,560
spot on my phone. She says, "It's a dead

35
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,920
zone here. That's not going to work

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,320
either. We need to go out to the parking

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,719
lot." So I go out to the parking lot on

38
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,079
a brisk November night with my laptop in

39
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,239
one hand and my phone in the other

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,319
trying to hold them up to the sky. I

41
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,919
finally get the email to go through. I

42
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,519
go back in. Uh she checks her email. She

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,600
got it, but unfortunately she couldn't

44
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,879
open the PDF with the shipping labels,

45
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,039
you know. Then at that point, I go,

46
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,879
"Listen, this is critically important

47
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
that we get this order out tonight for

48
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,879
our customer, and I've also come too far

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,479
and invested too much time into this."

50
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,239
She says, "Well, I I I just don't know

51
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,159
what to do." So, I say, "What if I get

52
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,158
behind the desk, I log into my company's

53
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
FedEx account, reprint the labels, and

54
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,000
she said, "If you think you can do it in

55
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,599
less than 10 minutes, go for it." So,

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
hop behind the desk, printed out the

57
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,798
labels, we got the order out, and the

58
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,360
customer was taken care of. I think that

59
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,040
that is a testament to the culture of

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,560
medicinal genomics and product

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,719
differentiators are great and we have a

62
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,359
lot of those. But one of our biggest

63
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:04,319
competitive advantages is our support

64
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,519
and service and our customers know that

65
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,118
we're always going to be honest and

66
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,159
transparent with them and always try to

67
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,159
go above and beyond with them.
