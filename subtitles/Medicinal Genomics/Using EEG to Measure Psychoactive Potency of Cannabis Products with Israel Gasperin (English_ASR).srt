71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,280
to measure the unique psychoactive

72
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,439
effects of

73
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,959
cannabis how EEG data can be applied to

78
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:44,400
THC percentage and plal percentage are

79
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,719
not directly correlated and

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
good afternoon Israel thank you so much

104
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,959
for joining me on the

105
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,000
podcast hello pamin thank you very much

106
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,279
for having me here happy to tell you

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,240
more about um our technology Cella and

108
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,599
uh sharing all of this information with

109
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,038
your audience yes I'm excited to talk

110
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,360
with you today about this wearable EEG

111
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:29,240
technology that your team has developed

112
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,080
to measure the effects of THC in the

113
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,280
user brain so let's start with what

114
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:38,639
inspired you to develop this

115
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:41,198
technology yeah thank you um so I think

116
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,720
I was thinking about the about this the

117
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,840
other day and the the main inspiration

118
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,479
to build this technology was in 2016

119
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:54,159
when the Canadian government was in the

120
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:58,279
process of legalizing a recreational

121
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:02,080
Cannabis consumption and the lack of a

122
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:04,478
test to object itively determine if a

123
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:07,318
person needs cannabis in or

124
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:10,318
not at that time we were building this

125
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,319
technology to detect drowsiness and

126
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,280
while driving and and we wanted to help

127
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:20,160
truck companies to keep their driver's

128
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:23,959
alert so they were telling us about this

129
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,280
um upcoming legalization of Canabis

130
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,638
consumption for non-medical purposes and

131
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,959
that they didn't have a way of detecting

132
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,478
cannabis impairment and that the current

133
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,079
way which is

134
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:40,758
analyzing and detecting concentration

135
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:44,598
levels of THC in saliva urine blood or

136
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:48,560
breath there didn't exist a test to

137
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:51,519
analyze the brain of of drivers so we

138
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,519
were like okay that's the aha moment

139
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:57,758
when we decided to Pivot from detecting

140
00:06:54,519 --> 00:07:00,198
drowsiness while driving to detecting

141
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,400
cannabis impairment while driving

142
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:08,520
and in that way help uh multiple markets

143
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,799
to better determine if a person is or

144
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,918
not impaired because that's the biggest

145
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,160
the biggest issue the we we we all know

146
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:20,918
very well that THC remains in body

147
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:24,400
fluids uh for many hours days or weeks

148
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:27,918
post impairment or experiencing the its

149
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:30,159
effects and and that that leads to

150
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,399
inaccurate determination ations about

151
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,840
being impaired so that was the main

152
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,878
reason that inspired us to to build this

153
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:41,719
technology and once we build it we

154
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,199
realized that

155
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,159
the the need for this type of brain wave

156
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,038
analysis was even bigger and Beyond the

157
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:54,719
the safety and law enforcement

158
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:58,680
applications and that other application

159
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,240
was for research to better understand

160
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,439
the effect and the quality and efficacy

161
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:08,079
of all of these Innovative products and

162
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:11,038
you know breeds and strains that the

163
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:15,158
market is developing and uh that's how

164
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:18,240
all started wow okay so so really to

165
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:23,000
start it was to try to determine how

166
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,319
impaired a driver was yes exactly the

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the the Ontario brain Institute and the

168
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,080
Ontario Center of innovation two two

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,918
Ontario uh government

170
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:36,519
organizations fully funded us to to to

171
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,918
develop this technology and that's how

172
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,839
we were able to build it because I hope

173
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,918
you will appreciate and your audience

174
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,800
will appreciate that in

175
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:50,360
2016 nobody really but not many were

176
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:53,039
familiarized and and Believers of the

177
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,519
potential of artificial intelligence

178
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:59,759
specifically when it's applied in brain

179
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:03,440
data so the government was the one one

180
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:07,200
that believed in this you know potential

181
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,320
crazy opportunity to you know complement

182
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,360
the current investigation process of

183
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,200
cannabis impaired driving determination

184
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,200
and they were the ones that funded us to

185
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,600
to build this technology build it to a

186
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:25,000
commercially L level kind of uh uh yeah

187
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,399
a level of commercial viab viability and

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,919
then conducting independent trials to

189
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,600
prove that AI

190
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:36,879
can do this type of brain wave analysis

191
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,040
at a way faster and more cost- effective

192
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,360
way and accurate than a neurologist or

193
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,360
neuroscientist doing it individually or

194
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,919
manually right so so that's how all

195
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,320
started oh so interesting so it's an AI

196
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,519
component as well absolutely that's the

197
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,120
the the main differentiator and the

198
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,480
uniqueness of our approach by the way

199
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,759
because EEG technology is not really new

200
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,920
it has been used for more than 100 years

201
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:09,720
but in the medical space neurologist

202
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,759
neuroscientists EEG technicians

203
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,480
certified EEG technicians have been

204
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,919
using it for you know more than 100

205
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,320
years the problem is and in fact we we

206
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:24,039
came to this conclusion and realized

207
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,640
that that's the main reason why EEG

208
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:29,838
technology has been inaccessible to

209
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:32,240
several Global non-medical Market

210
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,240
because when you require a neurologist

211
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,480
and neuroscientist and EG Technologies

212
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,799
buil for medical applications it becomes

213
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,278
very expensive very complicated to use

214
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:47,519
very slow and that makes it not

215
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,838
commercially viable for all of these

216
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,720
type of markets that are also conducting

217
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,760
some type of human research not

218
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,160
necessarily clinical or therapeutic but

219
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:02,319
it's more about understanding what is

220
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:05,480
the state of of individuals to make

221
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,120
better decisions in terms of safety you

222
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,680
know law enforcement product testing

223
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,759
product quality testing Etc yeah no no

224
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:18,359
and it's it's a great uh technology for

225
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,919
that application especially because as

226
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,519
you said the concentrations in the blood

227
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:26,919
or saliva they can last for much longer

228
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,519
than people are actually affected we've

229
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,199
we've had folks on the podcast talking

230
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,560
about those challenges before um so

231
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,879
that's a that's a great

232
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:38,759
advancement absolutely uh Benjamin and

233
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,679
and and if you think about it is the

234
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:44,319
exact same problem that we have when

235
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:48,599
it's about measuring the quality of

236
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,720
cannabis products right now now finally

237
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,440
I think the industry has kind of uh

238
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,480
gained more awareness about the

239
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,480
problematic that

240
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,399
represents a uh you know judging and

241
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,000
determining the quality of a product

242
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,278
just by the THC metric yes it's it's

243
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,480
very well known that you know that

244
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,559
doesn't necessarily determine the

245
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,360
quality and efficacy of a product to

246
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,759
create an intended psychoactive effect

247
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,399
or other type of effects it's not only

248
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,319
about THC it's overall if you think

249
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,958
about it it's a complete change of

250
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,639
Paradigm in terms of measuring product

251
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:31,198
quality I I think that we will always

252
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,720
continue measuring the quality of

253
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:35,559
ingredients and and accurately

254
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,959
determining the concentration levels of

255
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:42,039
those ingredients in products and plants

256
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:44,638
Etc but another big big thing is

257
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:47,439
determining its quality to the deliver

258
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,839
the intended benefit to the consumer and

259
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,160
I think we that's our vision and the

260
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:57,040
reason why we exist that analyzing the

261
00:12:53,159 --> 00:13:00,198
brain in a fast cost effective and

262
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:03,240
objective and scientific way is is the

263
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:07,159
is the approach to really determine in a

264
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,839
new way what what consumers are

265
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:12,719
experiencing and and measuring it in a

266
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,199
reliable and scientific way so it's it's

267
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,240
accepted by all the stakeholders because

268
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:19,159
I think that's the other big challenge

269
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,120
that we have seen you know there are

270
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:25,198
many solutions but I think uh coming up

271
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,560
with a solution that all like the main

272
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:29,719
stakeholders of the industry will accept

273
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,278
I think that that's the actual

274
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,720
you know uh event that needs to happen

275
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:38,039
someday in order to become a new

276
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,160
standard and that's what we are kind of

277
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,799
attempting to do long term no and you're

278
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,679
right I mean the industry really needs

279
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:49,919
sort of an objective way to evaluate the

280
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,399
effects of these products we make the we

281
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,919
make the comparison all the time to

282
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,759
alcohol but where're cannabis is really

283
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,159
different from alcohol is that you know

284
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,120
is the experience you know you drink

285
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,078
alcohol I mean maybe maybe you feel a

286
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,399
little bit different when you drink

287
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,638
tequila versus beer but for for all

288
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,399
intents and purposes that's not what is

289
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,360
differentiating your products right it's

290
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,039
more about the flavor or things like

291
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,240
that whereas with cannabis The

292
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:17,679
Experience can be very important so

293
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,759
having an objective way to maybe measure

294
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:24,278
that or show an effect is very important

295
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,839
absolutely Benjamin and and you know in

296
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:29,958
fact I think that it's it's it's an

297
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,440
undefined

298
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:35,198
unexplored space like we talk about

299
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,639
cannabis effects but there are probably

300
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:41,039
hundreds of effects that created by

301
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:44,519
cannabis and different cannaboids etc

302
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:47,120
etc and and and I think that you know

303
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,639
just differentiating them alone it's

304
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,879
it's something that we have never ever

305
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,639
done you know in in in the entire

306
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,240
history of humanity and I think that now

307
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,600
I think

308
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,799
that the the implementation of EEG

309
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,480
technology with machine learning and

310
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:09,519
science Etc is giving us the opportunity

311
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,639
for the first time to come up with

312
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,879
universal and

313
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:18,198
scientific and measurable definitions of

314
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:21,360
what they cannabis effect mean and and I

315
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:24,278
think that that's a one of the most

316
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,919
exciting opportunities to me to see you

317
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:28,360
know what is the potential of this

318
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,159
technology for that and and just to get

319
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,639
back to the point of subjectivity here

320
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,838
which is the the big matter that we have

321
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,680
been dealing with is that because of

322
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:43,279
this huge variability you know this huge

323
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:47,638
array of effects that cannabis creates

324
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:50,439
it's it's very um subjective and and

325
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,278
easy to provide different type of

326
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,720
feedback which is what it has been

327
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:59,159
happening with consumers right I I might

328
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:02,680
take two milligrams of THC and I I could

329
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:05,519
start feeling the body high and random

330
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:07,838
and uncontrollable thoughts which is the

331
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,720
the head high and another person might

332
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,639
feel strongly relaxed just with two

333
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,800
milligrams two milligrams of THC and

334
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,198
they might score in the drug effect

335
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:21,679
questionnaire a a high level of oh a

336
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,719
strong cannabis effect but these are

337
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:27,638
completely different effects so that is

338
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,519
the unreliability of just simply using

339
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:31,120
or getting a

340
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,799
consumer feedback if it's not

341
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,039
standardized and objective so in that

342
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,958
scenario and with your technology are

343
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,559
you able to see different areas of the

344
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,359
brain lighting up on those different

345
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:45,599
people who are experiencing different

346
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,600
effects absolutely Benjamin so the the I

347
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,800
I think maybe it's important to provide

348
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,199
a little bit of context to your audience

349
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:55,479
about the the the approach that is used

350
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,399
with machine learning and artificial

351
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,720
intelligence compared to the to the

352
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,958
current traditional appro approach that

353
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,439
has been used for more than 100 years

354
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,759
the current approach is all based on

355
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,199
neuroscientists and neurologist doing

356
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,160
very deep and clinical analysis of how

357
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:17,558
different regions of the brain are

358
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,839
stimulated by substances and there are

359
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:23,240
tens of papers explaining how cannabis

360
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:26,759
and other drugs and other things you

361
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,359
know uh impact your brain functionality

362
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,720
and the specific regions of the brain

363
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,719
Etc

364
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,919
but this analysis has hasn't been

365
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,400
standardized because of the complexity

366
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,200
of just simply detecting a specific

367
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,960
changes it's it's a like a complicated

368
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,640
combination of patterns or changes

369
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,000
happening in multiple regions of the

370
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,280
brain

371
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,839
Etc Ai and machine learning is based on

372
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,798
having large data sets of information

373
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:00,480
that you reliably know what they mean so

374
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:04,679
in order to build this technology we had

375
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,798
to conduct large scientific human trials

376
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,000
approved of of course by independent

377
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,240
ethic research boards and that that was

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,640
how they we use the funds that we raised

379
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,120
to build this large data set so we were

380
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,799
we were conducting manually and you know

381
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,918
carefully under control the scenarios

382
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:28,400
human trials where we were observing and

383
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:31,559
controlling how study subjects were in

384
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,440
taking cannabis and we use multiple

385
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:38,079
approach approaches to reliably

386
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,159
characterize the type of mental

387
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,960
cognitive or emotional state that they

388
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,320
were

389
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,558
experiencing so and and and and

390
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,918
Associate that to which of those are

391
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:52,759
related to or uniquely created by

392
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,720
cannabis and which ones are just altered

393
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:58,279
by cannabis for example emotions

394
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:02,360
emotions maybe cannabis might make you

395
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:04,879
feel more more more happy happier right

396
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,839
that you know that that state is

397
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,200
universal is not necessarily to Canabis

398
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:12,038
but getting back to the point yes we

399
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,080
have built these huge databases that now

400
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:20,359
are enabling us not only to generate the

401
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:23,240
pl metric the plal or or psychoactive

402
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:27,839
effect level metric is a specifically

403
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:31,038
designed to detect this mental state

404
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:33,599
that is making you experience unique can

405
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:37,279
of psychoactive effects like the body

406
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,519
high the you know the head high and you

407
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:43,639
know this famously called the hter

408
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:46,038
effect Etc but also you know the AI that

409
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,960
we are building is only is also helping

410
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:51,119
us to develop other metrics that measure

411
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,679
for example what is the relaxation state

412
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,759
of a study subjects and based on that

413
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,759
now also quantify how cannabis or

414
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,119
specific canab dos or a specific

415
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,919
products or specific amounts of a

416
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:08,519
product will impact that relaxation

417
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,919
state does it help you to relax or feel

418
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:13,798
sleepy or actually stimulates you to the

419
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,360
point that you want to be you know

420
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,679
mentally active and socialize and do

421
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,959
this this kind of stuff is is basically

422
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,919
the equivalent of the IND and sativa

423
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,000
thing is which is another meter right

424
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:30,759
that exist in the industry so it AI for

425
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,599
EEG analysis is measuring

426
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:36,200
multiple types of cannabis

427
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,079
effects and so are all those different

428
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,679
effects are they all sort of combined

429
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:44,240
into that peal metric no that that's a

430
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,320
great question right now we are the we

431
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,640
are building different metrics for for

432
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:54,918
one specific reason H Benjamin for

433
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,360
example the relaxation or energy or

434
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,000
sleep

435
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:02,639
effects these are mental States

436
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,798
Universal mental states that are not

437
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,559
necessarily and only impacted by

438
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:13,558
cannabis they are also impact impacted

439
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:17,038
by alanine and melatonin and herbs Etc

440
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:20,480
caffeine energy drinks Etc so we

441
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:23,759
strategically build these other metrics

442
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,839
as Standalone and Independence because

443
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,000
now we are also helping not only the

444
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:33,599
Cannabis cpg Market but other wellness

445
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,679
and health cpg markets that by the way

446
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,959
have the exact same problem that the

447
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:43,720
Cannabis cpg Market have their products

448
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:47,919
are marketed by clinically proven

449
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:51,880
alanine and yeah so so what like how did

450
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:55,038
you prove that the PO the the way you

451
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,600
mix a certain amount of Healy anding

452
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,278
with other active ingredients or

453
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:01,759
non-active ingredients

454
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:05,119
and and use a specific drug delivery

455
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,440
method and the format Etc the way it

456
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,959
will be consumed how do you prove that

457
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,360
that is the most effective way of

458
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,720
delivering an intended effect and and

459
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,319
and these other metrics are not only

460
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,000
helping cannabis for relaxation energy

461
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,879
or the Sleep effects are helping all all

462
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,880
these other wellness and health cpg

463
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,919
markets interesting all right so that

464
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,039
plal that is a specific effect for

465
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,720
cannabis

466
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:34,960
exactly that's exactly right excellent

467
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,000
excellent so I'm curious I was hoping

468
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,440
you would share a bit about the kind of

469
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,640
the findings that you found like what

470
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,880
were the different products that you

471
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,679
were testing and comparing to each other

472
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,320
and sort of what stood out or what was

473
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,400
surprising to you absolutely and and I'm

474
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:53,678
very much looking forward to presenting

475
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:58,120
this work in detail at canth 2025 in

476
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,720
beautiful Puerto Rico uh but but it it

477
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,278
is a

478
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,679
huge it's just a huge database of

479
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,159
product effects that we have been

480
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,519
accumulating Benjamin uh from different

481
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,039
type of different product formats

482
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,038
consumption methods and and consumption

483
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:15,839
amounts and different type of consumers

484
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:17,480
that have consume the those type of

485
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,798
products but we have been doing a

486
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,919
studies with for example with with back

487
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:27,319
slabs we conducted a partnership with

488
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:31,520
them in order to study the psychoactive

489
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:33,038
effect levels of live rossing you know

490
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:39,038
oils that are

491
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:43,158
vaporized versus distillate thhc ER Bots

492
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:45,679
and and uh you know one of the biggest

493
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,760
takeaways of that is that thanks to our

494
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,360
metric we were able to show you know the

495
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,000
quality and the famously called anash

496
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,439
effect that creates having you know a

497
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,839
live ring product which which you know

498
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,798
for those who don't know it It's a

499
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:03,959
combination of you extract all the

500
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:05,918
ingredients and properties more than

501
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,759
ingredients all the properties that are

502
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,159
in a plants when you squeeze it and and

503
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:16,200
get all of Thins and several minor

504
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:19,720
canabo THC and all of the other kind of

505
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,558
chem chemicals in that plant versus just

506
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,519
isolating THC with through distillation

507
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:29,398
and and coming up with that an oil just

508
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:33,158
with THC so what what this is sugesting

509
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:35,879
is that you know live rossing uh or at

510
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,200
least the way this company built it is

511
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:42,159
creating a stronger psychoactive effects

512
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,679
than just distill atic alone

513
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:50,080
interestingly both products suggest that

514
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:53,038
they have between 92 to 93 96% of THC

515
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:55,079
but the actual quality of the experience

516
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:58,599
is significantly different and this is

517
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:01,960
very important to them because then now

518
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:04,278
Brands like PS are now are also using

519
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,399
this type of data to educate consumers

520
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:10,079
and highlight why a live ring product is

521
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:12,319
a high quality product a premium and

522
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,678
more expensive product than the the

523
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,918
still THC alone so so that is one but we

524
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,880
have been doing a lot of research with

525
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:25,480
strings like you know joints that have

526
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:29,559
you know flag work that have 15 or less

527
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:33,038
percent of THC versus 30% of THC we have

528
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:36,720
been doing research with beverages that

529
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:39,599
have two or 2.5 milligrams of THC and

530
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,880
quantify how that psychoactive effect

531
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:47,879
level changes based on consuming 2.5

532
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,440
drinking 2.5 of of THC 5 milligrams or

533
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,080
10 milligrams of THC we have also been

534
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,600
doing research about what about changing

535
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:59,038
the consumption pattern of a drink

536
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:02,839
because you can have a beverage in 10

537
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:05,119
minutes and that will be a completely

538
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:06,519
different experience the onset time and

539
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,158
the potency of the experience will

540
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:12,960
change than if you are just sipping it a

541
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:17,159
10 milligram THC beverage you know you

542
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,278
are sipping it over an hour how that

543
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,640
changes the psychoactive experience and

544
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:25,919
I think that that will continue helping

545
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,360
a lot with consumer education and and

546
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,440
you know helping helping them to make

547
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:35,359
inform and responsible ER consumption

548
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,399
decisions so they can maximize the the

549
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,278
pleasant experience of cannabis and

550
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:43,119
minimize the

551
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:45,000
unpleasant effects which is they are

552
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,959
real and is the elephant in the room

553
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,319
that many don't want to talk about it

554
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,360
but the reality is that also you know

555
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:55,359
managing and minimizing the the you know

556
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:59,119
negative effects like paranoia and

557
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:02,158
anxiety Etc is is critical and right now

558
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,599
to the best of my knowledge nobody is

559
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,880
really helping consumers to do that and

560
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:10,639
I think that is potentially the Holy

561
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,919
Grail to you know just you know invite

562
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,559
many curious you know people to to try

563
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,799
Canabis have a great experience and then

564
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,960
adopted as a as another alternative than

565
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,398
alcohol or I don't know other substances

566
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,919
or problems interesting

567
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,879
so is that sort of that paranoia anxiety

568
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,159
that negative effect is that a metric

569
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,320
that you can actually

570
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,880
measure that is exactly right Benjamin

571
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:40,079
and and you know it was so interesting

572
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,559
because when we started to build this

573
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:46,359
technology and start conducting research

574
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:49,798
we didn't really know uh many things

575
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:53,798
about cannabis effects but I vividly

576
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:56,558
remember when some very frequent and and

577
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:59,558
daily cannabis consumers used to tell me

578
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:03,519
you know what you know I I can you know

579
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:06,839
smoke a joint but and I can do as many

580
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:10,240
Buffs as I want or you you you need for

581
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:13,038
the research but there is a point where

582
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,278
I just don't continue getting

583
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:19,398
higher it's it it flattens and it

584
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:22,398
doesn't change anything else but what we

585
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:24,719
found out with our EEG technology and

586
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,000
also at that time administration of

587
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,079
psychological tests proven to

588
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,079
characterize your mood

589
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:37,079
the biggest take away was that yes at a

590
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:40,879
certain point study subjects didn't feel

591
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:44,199
more higher and with our EG scans and

592
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,760
the pl psychoactive effect level metric

593
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,519
we showed and and obtain objective

594
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:51,240
evidence that the pl the psychoactive

595
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:55,440
effect level they were experiencing was

596
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,278
the same whether you were having I think

597
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,600
around six to nine Puffs I don't

598
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:04,919
remember the exact number or 11 to 20

599
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:09,439
something pffs same psychoactive effect

600
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:11,278
level but what it was changing was their

601
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,278
the their mood

602
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:18,079
changes the first group was experiencing

603
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:21,599
Serene and positive effects like feeling

604
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:23,960
more Serene where whereas the other the

605
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:28,599
other group was feeling

606
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:31,360
anxious and and so so I think in an Med

607
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:34,319
World which I think it will happen the

608
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:37,519
sooner or later I think that the strings

609
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:40,359
will be sold and and with this

610
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,798
information that will indicate how many

611
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:45,678
Buffs you should intake according to the

612
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,720
properties of that strain and

613
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,960
potentially according to the profile of

614
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,360
consumers in order to maximize those

615
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,480
pleasant effects and minimize anxiety

616
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,678
and paranoia and all of those unpleasant

617
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,038
effects interesting okay so just going

618
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:06,720
back so so what is the plal actually

619
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:09,919
measuring if not um sort of mood and and

620
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,120
that sort of thing it's just how

621
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:17,080
um impaired a person is what what is the

622
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:20,398
PO metric yeah exactly it's basically

623
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:24,798
measuring a specific and

624
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:27,479
unique brain w alterations Associated to

625
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,759
the specific psychoactive effects of

626
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,880
cannabis

627
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:36,960
or THC or these other canabas related to

628
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,480
the psychoactive effects like feeling

629
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,720
the body high the random uncontrollable

630
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,200
thoughts and the the head high all of

631
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,720
these effects that

632
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,840
are I don't know if they are therapeutic

633
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,558
to the best of my knowledge but but but

634
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:55,480
they create this like nothing else to

635
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:58,798
the best of my knowledge creates that

636
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,599
type of specific effects and and that's

637
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:04,158
what the PL metric generate you know

638
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,759
measures H the other metrics that we

639
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,120
have now measure other type of effects

640
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:13,278
like whether you are feeling more you

641
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:16,000
know energized or more relaxed or sleepy

642
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:18,000
Etc excellent okay cool and now I see

643
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,839
the is that the device behind you back

644
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,720
there exactly it's it's it's a it's our

645
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:26,519
own wearable device and and the reason

646
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,679
behind because somebody asked me why the

647
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,399
heck did you build your own device if

648
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,840
there are so many in the market and I

649
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:35,879
was like well for for the specific

650
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:39,359
reason that there is nothing that really

651
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:43,480
works for this type of research that we

652
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:46,359
are conducting for non therapeutic and

653
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,679
non medical applications it's it's it's

654
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:52,638
just about mood effects and and cannabis

655
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,759
effects Etc and in order to do it you

656
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:58,519
need to make it very cost

657
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,720
effective very straightforward to use

658
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,038
you don't need to be measuring the head

659
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,399
like the head of the study subjects and

660
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,839
from here

661
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:11,918
measure X number of you know centimeters

662
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:14,240
or whatever in the 20 the 1020 system we

663
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:18,480
converted all of that into basic

664
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,558
standardized you know um indicators to

665
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,558
apply the device so quickly and easily

666
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:29,000
so anyone and anyone I mean food

667
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:31,918
scientist product Developers my team and

668
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,359
I who I'm not a neuroscientist either

669
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,720
are able to use this technology and and

670
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:40,599
collect EEG

671
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,639
data for this type of scientific

672
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:46,240
research excellent so you know

673
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:48,678
researchers they could develop their own

674
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,759
sort of their own

675
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:56,840
trial that is exactly right benjam me we

676
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:59,919
created some let me call it standardized

677
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:02,918
master EG research protocol that has

678
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,038
been approved by H Canada and have been

679
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,440
approved multiple times by different

680
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:10,200
independent ethic research boards but

681
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,639
the beauty of our standardized research

682
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,558
protocol is that it enables our partners

683
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:18,599
because we don't only do research in our

684
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:21,038
lab we are implementing this technology

685
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,038
in other labs and research hospitals is

686
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:27,960
that they can customize you know this

687
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:32,319
this protocol they can typically what we

688
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,159
do is EEG recordings before the

689
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,839
intervention or consumption of a product

690
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,519
and then after the consumption of the

691
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:43,359
product so after the after consumption

692
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:47,359
recordings are completely customizable

693
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:49,240
you can do many EEG scans or recordings

694
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,119
right at the beginning the first 30

695
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,440
minutes if your objective is to capture

696
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:56,918
the the onet time as accurately as

697
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,558
possible think about as resolution right

698
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:02,600
the more samp the higher the resolution

699
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:06,119
to see how that evolves but also you can

700
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:09,039
do it you know you can just record the E

701
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,838
of a study subjects and map that product

702
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:14,679
experience for up to 30 minutes or 45

703
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:20,039
minutes or one hour or three hours or up

704
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:23,280
to five hours Etc right you you can you

705
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:27,358
know customize that according to the

706
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,560
needs of the needs and objectives of the

707
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,918
company or research organization that is

708
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:35,239
conducting research in this in this

709
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:37,440
field yeah and I have to imagine this

710
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,878
being you know Ai and machine learning

711
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,639
the more data that folks are generating

712
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,398
it's just going to feed into the system

713
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,838
and just improve it

714
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:49,319
correct exactly Benjamin it's it's just

715
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:52,239
it's just like snowball because the more

716
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,960
data we collect the more AI will

717
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:59,759
continue learning and and and I think

718
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,960
that we will get to a point where the pl

719
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,720
metric will not only measure you know

720
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:08,079
the high and you know how strong is that

721
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:10,319
effect Etc it will it will also tell us

722
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,200
what type of high you are experiencing

723
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,200
are you experiencing the body high or

724
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:20,078
the head high or what hallucinations I

725
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:22,679
don't know Etc I think that it will get

726
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,920
to that level of accuracy and even

727
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:28,118
better I think that it will get to a

728
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,079
point where we will be able to personal

729
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,680
it so imagine that at a certain point

730
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,280
and I want to be one of the first ones

731
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:37,440
to say it because I really think it will

732
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:40,000
happen is that these devices will become

733
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,320
you know gadgets for consumers where you

734
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,599
will be able to wear it it will read

735
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,320
your brainway and will know who you are

736
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,000
what type of what type of brain you are

737
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:56,000
and based on that you will tell this app

738
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,039
hey you know I I want to relax today

739
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,480
okay you are this type of brain you want

740
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:02,838
to relax these are the type of products

741
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,119
that you should consume and this is how

742
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:09,078
you should consume them I I think that

743
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:12,559
that that would be the one of the late

744
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:16,440
latest stages of adoptions uh of

745
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:19,000
adoption of where e g technology and AI

746
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,318
for for this type of consumer package

747
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,199
good markets like personalized

748
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:25,960
recommendations of product used to

749
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,159
accomplish and experience yeah I mean I

750
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,199
can definitely I can definitely see a

751
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,920
future with that I mean I I wear my

752
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:35,439
Apple watch I track my recovery and all

753
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,240
that to inform when uh if I should work

754
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,800
out or not so um it definitely seems

755
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:43,000
like uh that's a

756
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:47,400
possibility totally Benjamin I I you

757
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,079
know to I mean we believe in this 10

758
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,880
years ago and that's why we continue

759
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:53,640
doing this because we want to be

760
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,559
somebody needs to do it and we want to

761
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:59,480
be one of the first in doing it and I

762
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:02,719
just really think that is um nobody has

763
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,000
built the databases that are required to

764
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:08,078
unlock the potential of artificial

765
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,760
intelligence to help us you know make

766
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,640
this type of brain analysis to

767
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,440
understand cognitive emotional or mental

768
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:22,000
states of people and and and I think

769
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,599
that this is just the beginning of many

770
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,400
other applications this technology as I

771
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,079
was sharing with you was built for

772
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,680
safety and law enforcement

773
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,318
I I I just realized 10 years ago or

774
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:36,838
eight years ago that cops were not going

775
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:39,599
to use this technology right away first

776
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,960
because it's a little bit of removing a

777
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,920
little bit of their you know power

778
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,760
because it's no longer you giving your

779
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,960
expert opinion it's still subjective

780
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,280
though it's now you know an objective

781
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,679
assessment and I think it was very

782
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,760
controversial at that time to prove that

783
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:02,519
you could have the see in

784
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:05,680
saliva and and our EEG show that your

785
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:09,280
brain WS are not altered anymore so our

786
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:13,039
PE reviewed publication show that this

787
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,920
evidence could eliminate up to 50% of

788
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,400
inaccurate accusations of being impaired

789
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,119
or not being impaired just because of

790
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:27,838
the amount of THC in Sal or whatever so

791
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:30,079
I I think that the you know these new

792
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:33,440
neurot Technologies not not only Centras

793
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,480
maybe others will be adopted by several

794
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,280
other non-medical markets that continue

795
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,880
you know depending on subjective

796
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,319
assessments of uh people right so but

797
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,440
it's a very very very exciting a time

798
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:48,880
for for everyone who is in these spaces

799
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,880
yeah yeah and when you talk about

800
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,400
impairment too like would it would it

801
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,760
work for alcohol like to correlate

802
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,559
someone's blood alcohol content to how

803
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,599
effective they actually are exactly you

804
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:04,480
know in fact I think that right now our

805
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:08,119
our perception of impairment is a little

806
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,519
bit I don't know if limited is the word

807
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,800
but but maybe it's not you know fully

808
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:14,440
aware of what impairment means and you

809
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,119
know you could be driving and you are

810
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,200
impaired because you are in Shock you

811
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,640
are hyper stressed you are extremely

812
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,000
tired you are extremely piss because

813
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,679
something happened to you and now you're

814
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,880
driving so aggressively you know you you

815
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:31,799
may be Dr you might be high with

816
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,480
cannabis you might be you know high with

817
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,839
so many other substances so I think

818
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,920
that's why I was mentioning building

819
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:40,480
these

820
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,720
databases directly Associated to all of

821
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,079
these states is what it will unlock the

822
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:47,199
law

823
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:49,880
enforcement use of this type of

824
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:53,719
technology to Better h you know to

825
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,599
improve safety on our roads and and you

826
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,759
know it's it's it's not we haven't

827
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,920
forgotten about that market but we just

828
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,960
believe that is just the tip of the

829
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,480
iceberg and it's it's a longer term

830
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,358
application I think that just for pure

831
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,400
you know cannabis effect research for

832
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:15,559
you know educational purposes to help

833
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,519
Brands you know prove you know product

834
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:21,920
quality and differentiate their products

835
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:24,800
is is just an ontap Market that is right

836
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,159
there and and that's what we have been

837
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,800
doing in the last three years yeah I

838
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:31,239
know and when you're talking about like

839
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,079
sort of personalizing it and having you

840
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:36,799
know one of your own for sort of your

841
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,318
personal use like I can imagine you know

842
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,920
if you were wearing something it's

843
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,199
probably be a different device but

844
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,639
you're getting ready to write a an email

845
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:46,199
to someone it kind of triggers like you

846
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,400

measuring that type of emotions will

853
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:10,879
enable many other markets to make better

854
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,399
more accurate more informed decisions

looking forward to meeting with them and

876
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,480
presenting our work because I I really

877
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:09,598
think that one of the biggest challenges

878
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:13,719
that the entire the global cannabis

879
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,039
Market is facing is saturation and

880
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:18,799
undifferentiation and and right now the

881
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:21,519
consumer is not aware of that and they

882
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,039
don't believe in words but what we have

883
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:27,358
been doing in Massachusetts which I will

884
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:29,039
be presenting is about the way we

885
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,719
helping all of these companies to

886
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,000
differentiate their high quality

887
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:37,318
products regardless of their canabo

888
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,039
properties and and leverage that to

889
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:42,639
really transform the way they develop

890
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:44,400
products they test them and also they

891
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,318
take them to Market and educate

892
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,720
retailers and consumers to really

893
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,880
differentiate their brands and their

894
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,759
products and I really think that that's

895
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,318
the future of cannabis cpg and I'm very

896
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,760
much looking forward to connecting with

897
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:02,279

898
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,720
