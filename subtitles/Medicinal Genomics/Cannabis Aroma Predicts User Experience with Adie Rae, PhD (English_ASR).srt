and she is passionate about the

53
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:35,399
interaction between cannabis and opioids

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,340
our conversation focused on a paper

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,420
Addie recently co-authored called the

56
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,759
nose nose Aroma but not THC mediates

57
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,799
subjective effects of smoked and

58
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,378
vaporized cannabis flour

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,439
as the title suggests the study found

60
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:55,139
that users subjective enjoyment of a

61
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,539
cannabis flower's Aroma was correlated

62
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:00,238
with that flower producing a pleasant

63
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:03,179
effect for the user or more simply put

64
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,939
if you like the smell

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,400
or more simply put if you like the way a

66
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,739
cannabis flower smells you're going to

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,680
like the way it makes you feel

68
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,300
during our conversation we discuss the

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,300
subjective

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,580
the subjectivity of cannabis aroma

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,680
whether the ability to predict a

72
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,840
positive experience through Aroma is

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,420
learned or intuitive

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,700
how closed container markets do a

75
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,098
disservice to Consumers

76
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,280
how the study found that the amount of

77
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:37,439
THC in a cultivar did not correlate with

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,199
positive user experience and what that

79
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,900
means for the industry

80
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,839
the difference between feeling high and

81
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,480
feeling good and the importance of

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,580
Tolerance breaks

83
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,738
before we get to my conversation with Dr

84
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,040
Addie Ray I want to thank this episode

[Music]

98
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,120
thanks so much for joining us on the

99
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,680
podcast it's a pleasure to be here Ben

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,899
thanks

101
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,240
yeah I mean I'm really excited to talk

102
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:45,899
with you today about a paper that you

103
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,900
co-authored called the nose nose Aroma

104
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:51,539
but not THC mediates the subjective

105
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,500
effects of smoked and vaporized cannabis

106
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,740
flour

107
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,899
fascinating paper to me because it

108
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,360
really challenges this idea that THC

109
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,758
potency determines cannabis flower

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,740
quality it's something that's come up

111
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,819
many times on this podcast so I'm happy

112
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,199
to see some some data confirming this

113
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,240
um there's a lot of great information in

114
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,699
the paper I marked up my copy quite a

115
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,379
bit and I'm providing a link to the

116
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,360
paper in the show description so the

117
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,459
listeners can read it as well but before

118
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,680
we get too deep into it I wanted to ask

119
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,198
you why did you and your co-authors

120
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,819
decide to take on this study and what

121
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,819
questions were you looking to answer

122
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:40,259
highlight is that the study the paper is

123
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,959
actually a byproduct of the actual

124
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:46,139
purpose for the work because the purpose

125
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,299
for the work was a couple of weed cups

126
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,400
it was you know cannabis competitions

127
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,400
and the purpose there of course was to

128
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:56,638
identify objectively the best cannabis

129
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:59,698
in Oregon so truly using the most

130
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:03,060
rigorous scientific tools we could to

131
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,759
really identify high quality cannabis

132
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,699
and then reward those cultivators for

133
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,819
producing that cannabis so that was the

134
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:14,160
original intent behind all of the work

135
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,439
as a result of doing those cannabis

136
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,020
competitions here in Oregon

137
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,538
um we were able to you know come up with

138
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:24,719
this big Anonymous database which then

139
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:26,579
we could you know mine post hoc for all

140
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,900
of the insights that you see in the

141
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,719
paper

142
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:33,060
um so it was really important for my

143
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,759
teammates and I um and I'll highlight

144
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:39,418
them specifically stuff Barnhart

145
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,240
Jeremy Plum among many others it really

146
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:46,978
was a community effort to use the best

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,740
tool possible to Define quality cannabis

148
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:51,659
excellent so now you said this you

149
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,740
collected the state over over several

150
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,939
years or several events how did your

151
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,460
criteria for determining quality

152
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:01,459
cannabis change as you as you did this

153
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,180
she really sat down to think about what

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,459
are the components that we are trying to

155
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,100
analyze here right what questions are we

156
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:21,299
going to ask of our volunteers who are

157
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:24,840
sampling the Cannabis and you know

158
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,418
it it's kind of no-brainer stuff it's

159
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,060
really you know like how much did you

160
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:32,038
enjoy this we always knew that Aroma was

161
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,360
important so we asked how pleasant was

162
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,459
the aroma

163
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,120
and then we also asked questions about

164
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:41,758
the sort of large domains that cannabis

165
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,280
is well known for right like is it

166
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,800
energizing or sleepy does it make you

167
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:50,279
feel relaxed or tense you know really

168
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,740
you know not rocket science it's really

169
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,138
all the things that all of the reasons

170
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,639
that consumers are using cannabis to

171
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,800
begin with

172
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,259
um that's what we were looking at

173
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,660
um so that that's the human sort of data

174
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,819
collection end of things and then on the

175
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,680
other end too you know we wanted as much

176
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,620
information about the plant as we could

177
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,639
you know at that time so

178
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,439
widest panel of analytes in terms of

179
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,939
cannabinoids and terpenes

180
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,800
um and you know of course our

181
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,379
understanding of this plant and the

182
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,538
aromatic molecules that contribute to

183
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,160
its Aroma have evolved a lot since we

184
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,459
last collected data

185
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,080
um in you know 2019-2020

186
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,939
um but nevertheless it was really

187
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,519
important for us to have high fidelity

188
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,120
human information and High Fidelity

189
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,218
plant information and see just literally

190
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,560
it's a fishing Expedition what is the

191
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:46,620
data going to tell us so it's really

192
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,559
liberating in this that you know most of

193
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,778
my academic research is of course

194
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,838
hypothesis oriented so it was really

195
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:57,600
liberating to have a true Expedition and

196
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,100
tell a data-driven story allow the data

197
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,540
to tell us what's important about

198
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,399
cannabis

199
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,778
yeah I know and it sounds like so you're

200
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,159
collecting two different types of data

201
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:06,899
as you mentioned you know on The Human

202
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,819
Side what was your experience with this

203
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,559
and then you know on the lab side you

204
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,540
know what are the the percentages and

205
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,458
the numbers here so so I imagine you

206
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:16,079
tried to marry the two

207
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,699
um to try to find some patterns and that

208
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,220
and that's sort of what you're doing in

209
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,320
the paper here yes exactly and what you

210
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,980
don't see in the paper are all of the

211
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,140
results that are not so exciting so so

212
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,959
you know one of the things of course we

213
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,879
are super interested in is you know what

214
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,579
is this Entourage effect you know what

215
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,639
evidence do we have that a combination

216
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,580
of molecules is somehow contributing to

217
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,259
some domain of The Human Experience and

218
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,480
despite our best efforts to put it

219
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:46,919
through machine learning models and you

220
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,459
know apply all of these like really

221
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:53,039
rigorous techniques to the data it spat

222
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:55,859
out a couple of things one of which was

223
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,860
thca is important

224
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,139
well yeah we we kind of already knew

225
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,740
that so

226
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:07,199
you know um we didn't find you know any

227
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,839
one terpene for example that was you

228
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,000
know strongly associated with any one

229
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,740
particular domain of the of The Human

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,839
Experience

231
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,120
um so you know despite our best efforts

232
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,279
to look for those things and prove or

233
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,959
disprove those sort of urban legends

234
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:23,820
that are floating around out there you

235
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,859
know mere seeing being

236
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,660
um sedative for example our data didn't

237
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,899
support that

238
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:33,419
um so so yeah we we we weren't able to

239
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:36,539
really hone in on any one particular

240
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:38,099
molecule as being the driving factor in

241
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,579
the Cannabis experience other than

242
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,740
knowing that you know thca the the you

243
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,240
know decarboxylated version or the

244
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,039
carboxyl

245
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,079
um of THC

246
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,000
um we already knew that was important

247
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,019
contributes to the psychoactive

248
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,179
properties

249
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,120
right no and it's interesting that you

250
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,219
mentioned terpenes because you know

251
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,959
we talk about chirpings a lot and how

252
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,060
they're important and how they you know

253
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,278
differentiate the Cannabis cultivars but

254
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,719
really I mean you're not the first

255
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,220
person that I've talked to that said

256
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,660
that you know they looked for a

257
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,820
connection between terpenes and

258
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,980
experience or even you know therapeutic

259
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,240
applications but they're not really

260
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,399
finding it

261
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,079
um you know why do you think that is or

262
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,179
do you think that you know terpenes are

263
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,879
a bit of a a red herring here what's

264
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:27,120
what's going on yeah yeah I think that

265
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:29,100
the most likely what's going on and I

266
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,740
you know of course this is just one of

267
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,079
many possibilities but what's likely

268
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,700
going on is that things are a lot more

269
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,299
complicated than we would like them to

270
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,399
be

271
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:39,659
so we're looking for the easy answers

272
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,940
and

273
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:44,338
um it's probably not an easy answer

274
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,899
one of the cool opportunities that I had

275
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,760
in sort of digging through the

276
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:51,600
literature to prepare this manuscript

277
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:54,419
was getting really really deep into the

278
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,120
sensory sciences and and you know even

279
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,639
like looking really deep into fine

280
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,919
fragrances perfumes consumer fragrances

281
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,439
that kind of stuff and that body of

282
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,000
literature is you know very mature and

283
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,700
there's lots of cool artificial

284
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,339
intelligence models for Aroma you know

285
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,560
predictions and stuff like that

286
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,779
um but what I came to understand and

287
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:19,078
there is a citation in the paper was

288
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:22,320
that the presence of even a single

289
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:26,639
additional aromatic molecule totally

290
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,640
changes our perception of an aroma and

291
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,699
if that's true for just your olfactory

292
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,799
epithelium the inside your nose what

293
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,778
else is happening higher up all the way

294
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,240
up in your brain and especially you know

295
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:43,200
in the really sophisticated circuits in

296
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,299
our prefrontal cortex so if we know that

297
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,940
you know the presence of even one other

298
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:50,879
molecule can totally change our

299
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,680
experience of a product then that's

300
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:57,179
probably what's going on it's probably

301
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:59,879
just such a complicated and

302
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:03,059
um a situation that's so difficult to

303
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,980
replicate time after time that there's

304
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:07,979
you know we're we're really at the

305
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:11,879
limits of our technology right we simply

306
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,278
don't have the tools to process all of

307
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,439
the information better than our brains

308
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,480
already do which is to say this smells

309
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,060
good right

310
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
right and that was I mean I mean we've

311
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,338
kind of been beating around the bush

312
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,799
here but that was sort of the main

313
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,260
finding of your paper right is that you

314
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,899
know what smells good to the user is

315
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,100
usually predictive of what is going to

316
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,799
create a good experience for them

317
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,959
exactly exactly and that subjective

318
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,419
component I think is really important to

319
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,179
highlight you know we do show some data

320
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:46,019
in the paper where there is if we look

321
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:48,719
at the variability in people's responses

322
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:51,360
or you know their ratings for the

323
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,120
pleasantness of the aroma

324
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,180
um so there are some flowers where they

325
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,639
have a high you know score they're

326
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,319
really great smelling flowers and those

327
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,259
great smelling flowers there's a lot of

328
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,720
consensus people agree there's low

329
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:09,600
variability in terms of the aroma score

330
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,120
but the further you get away from like

331
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,639
the you know top 20 percent of great

332
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,159
smelling flowers the more polarizing

333
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,379
they are so you know on the far end

334
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,259
where we have some flowers with low

335
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:24,120
Aroma scores there's a huge degree of

336
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,379
variability some people love them and

337
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,980
some people don't

338
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:30,659
and so the analogy that I think about

339
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,639
all the time again coming back to

340
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:34,379
perfume because I think it's the the

341
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,860
most

342
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:40,980
comparison is that you know we can all

343
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,919
agree that this super expensive you know

344
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,800
like designer perfume at this specialty

345
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,259
perfume house we can all agree oh my God

346
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,000
this thing smells amazing it's like you

347
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,500
know Ambrosia

348
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,059
um whereas if we're walking through the

349
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,740
mall and there's someone's you know

350
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,539
spraying something cheap into the air

351
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,698
that one might be a little more

352
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:01,139
polarizing right there might be some of

353
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,419
us that would be like oh yeah I'd wear

354
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,820
that and others would be like no no no

355
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,979
don't get near me right so I think

356
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,079
that's a really nice comparison

357
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,480
um because it tells us that it really is

358
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,698
subjective that

359
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,740
um there's some degree of consensus if

360
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:19,198
you have a really great smelling flower

361
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,120
you know the breeder or the wholesaler

362
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,519
or a bud tender might be able to say

363
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,198
okay these three are the best smelling

364
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
ones

365
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,439
um but there is absolutely

366
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,560
um

367
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,079
objective component where a consumer

368
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,419
must be able to make a decision for

369
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,278
themselves based on their own sensory

370
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:42,360
perception of that flower

371
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:43,860
right and now I'm curious too

372
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,680
um and we could talk a bit about you

373
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,240
know how what the profile of the

374
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,859
different users are whether they're

375
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,019
daily users and things I know there's a

376
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,120
lot of information about that but do you

377
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:57,000
think that what's going on is that

378
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,339
people are smelling something familiar

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,139
you know it might be similar to a strain

380
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,120
that they've used in the past and

381
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:06,360
they're associating that with a positive

382
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,000
experience or is it just truly

383
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,220
um you know intuitive where like oh I

384
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,899
like this smell and you know it just so

385
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,160
happens that that's what their body

386
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,019
wants yeah I my my hypothesis and you

387
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:20,939
know I'm a neuroscientist and my my

388
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,620
field is definitely not the sensory

389
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,620
Sciences so maybe someone with that

390
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,778
my hypothesis is the latter that it's

391
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,759
just intuitive right like when you're

392
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:35,519
walking down the street that reaction

393
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,639
you have when you smell the you know

394
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,320
Falafel Cart on the sidewalk right that

395
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,879
reaction that you have is not something

396
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,320
that you're like oh that reminds me of

397
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,519
that one time that I was in New York

398
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,800
City you know for New Year's Eve

399
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:50,278
whatever you know like it's an intuitive

400
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,919
like it it's it strums the instrument

401
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,179
within your heart you know like you

402
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,979
don't have to think about it there's a

403
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,899
reaction there

404
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,639
um and sometimes it's like uh you know

405
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,458
like gross or sometimes it's really

406
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,980
appealing so I think that Aroma is

407
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:10,019
really interesting because all of the

408
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:11,939
olfactory processes and the evolution of

409
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:13,798
um being able to smell things in the

410
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:17,100
environment interpret those

411
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:20,099
environmental cues as either a cue to

412
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,918
approach or avoid something that's

413
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,958
really really deeply buried in our

414
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,480
medulla and and you know that's really

415
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,779
old circuitry that is conserved across

416
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,480
you know the phylogenetic tree so my

417
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:36,599
sense is that there is like low level

418
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,360
you know intuitive or or you know sort

419
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:40,859
of automatic kind of processing that

420
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,019
happens with Aroma that we don't

421
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,699
necessarily need to put much conscious

422
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:48,599
thought into

423
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:51,538
interesting so if instead of looking at

424
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,058
you know THC percentages or terpene

425
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:56,220
percentages when we're evaluating which

426
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:58,139
cannabis to buy we should really be

427
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,259
getting our nose in there and giving it

428
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,140
a smell absolutely that is I think the

429
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:06,240
biggest take-home message for all of The

430
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,538
Regulators in states where there are

431
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,859
closed container laws so in Oregon you

432
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,960
know I'm here in Portland and we have

433
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:13,979
the benefit of having you know deli

434
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,819
style

435
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,620
um

436
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:19,379
um dispensaries so you can literally

437
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:22,019
walk into any store and stick your nose

438
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:25,500
in an ounce it's great

439
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:28,200
um but that benefit doesn't occur in

440
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,119
California and in Washington

441
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,860
um and it's really in those closed

442
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,259
container markets where The Regulators

443
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,298
have done a serious disservice to the

444
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:39,839
consumers because they have robbed them

445
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:42,000
of the only information that we have to

446
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,500
make a really great decision about what

447
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,980
to buy

448
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,038
yeah and now is that in place for you

449
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,460
know sanitary reasons or is that the

450
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:52,460
thinking

451
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,839
the most likely answer is probably just

452
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,579
a law enforcement one right it's just a

453
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,959
matter of keeping things tightly under

454
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,939
control

455
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,740
um it's you know I I wasn't there when

456
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,440
they made those rags in Washington so I

457
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,298
can't say what those motivations were

458
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,058
um but I can say that you know it's it's

459
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:18,000
not you know those sort of package only

460
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:21,000
markets are problematic not only from

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,298
the perspective of you know being devoid

462
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,980
of Aroma but is excessive packaging also

463
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:28,079
which is like I'm sure an entirely

464
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,440
different podcast but but yeah it's

465
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,000
unnecessary

466
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,919
yeah and so going back to this whole

467
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,440
idea of you know sort of the the

468
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,500
quantitative results that we often see

469
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,798
on packaging or on websites um is not as

470
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,500
informative as as just smelling um one

471
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:49,679
of the some of the results from your

472
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,200
paper were showing that you know THC

473
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,620
potency was not correlated with

474
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,900
subjective appeal and you know the the

475
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,339
amount of terpenes present wasn't either

476
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,798
I was wondering if you could talk a bit

477
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:03,599
more about that I would be so delighted

478
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:06,298
to them as my favorite Topic in the

479
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,538
whole wide world all right let's do it

480
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:11,839
um so right now and there are very good

481
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:11,839
reasons for

482
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:19,340
THC is the primary marker of quality

483
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:23,339
cannabis right

484
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:24,839
and you know this has roots both in the

485
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,659
Legacy Market you know in the

486
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:30,000
prohibition days there are you know sort

487
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,419
of black market drug dynamics that

488
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,880
contribute to why people who produce

489
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,960
drugs want to make them as strong as

490
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,419
they can

491
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,840
so there's that Legacy that has carried

492
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:45,299
over into this regulated environment and

493
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:48,359
in this regulated environment there has

494
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:50,879
been a push toward more and more potent

495
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:54,058
products right demand for high THC

496
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,940
products has been high so then you know

497
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:59,700
the supply chain responds by producing

498
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,820
high THC products and so you have this

499
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,919
feed forward cycle where everyone is

500
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:07,200
producing where what they think the

501
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,840
costs what they think the customer wants

502
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,538
and the customer thinks they want THC

503
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,199
when in fact our paper demonstrates that

504
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:19,140
you know the amount of THC is really

505
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,480
irrelevant I I'm not at all you know our

506
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:25,140
data doesn't support and I don't think

507
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,240
that THC is irrelevant you know it's

508
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,600
very obvious that there is a

509
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,000
relationship between THC and

510
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,839
psychoactive effects that's what gets

511
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,038
you high

512
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:41,220
however there is not a linear

513
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:44,700
relationship between how much THC and

514
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,980
how much enjoyment there is so so that

515
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,580
brings up another topic which is this

516
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:53,880
distinction between getting high and

517
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,798
feeling good because you know there is a

518
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,260
therapeutic window there's a sweet spot

519
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:01,200
where you do need THC to feel something

520
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:03,599
but if you have too much THC the

521
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,740
negative effects outweigh the beneficial

522
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:11,459
effects so you know that there is an

523
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:14,640
assumption that more THC is better more

524
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,079
THC is high quality more THC is a better

525
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,759
value

526
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,899
um and there's this you know like ever

527
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:24,240
escalating push toward more and more THC

528
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,000
which is not an evidence-based approach

529
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,058
because this this data tells us that

530
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,919
yeah THC is going to get you high but

531
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,899
it's not necessarily going to make you

532
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,200
feel good

533
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,940
right no and I I always think it's

534
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,940
interesting that you know this push for

535
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,279
more and more potent cannabis more

536
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,440
higher percentages of THC

537
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,538
um I mean and if you look at alcohol I

538
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,038
mean that's just it's not the case you

539
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:52,200
know people aren't going to the liquor

540
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,658
store and buying Everclear or just

541
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,519
drinking straight ethanol like it's it's

542
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,440
more of an experience about the flavor

543
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,339
and you know everything else that comes

544
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,019
with it

545
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:02,639
um it's just interesting that cannabis

546
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,980
hasn't gotten there yet

547
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,200
exactly and and I like that the fact

548
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,779
that you use the word yet because I

549
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,940
think that we have an opportunity here

550
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:14,099
right this is a wake-up call that it's

551
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,419
time to diversify the spend the

552
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,939
dispensary Shelf

553
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,520
you know like right now the way that the

554
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,759
retail Marketplace looks it looks very

555
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:27,720
much like going into a bar that has 37

556
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:30,538
flavors of Everclear right and so if we

557
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,360
think about well what what does what

558
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:36,538
does the consumer actually want versus

559
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,359
what do they think they want so what

560
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:41,279
they actually want is probably diversity

561
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,798
they want to try a bunch of different

562
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,200
stuff because there are a bunch of

563
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,240
different kinds of experiences that are

564
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,940
possible with cannabis it's really

565
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,480
interesting that you know alcohol it

566
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,640
really is a great comparison because

567
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,240
we have a pretty

568
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,120
um

569
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,460
narrow band of responses to alcohol

570
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:04,678
everyone knows what it feels like if

571
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,620
you're over 21. everyone knows what it

572
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,440
feels like to have one drink or have a

573
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:12,178
little buzz or to be drunk or to be too

574
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,820
drunk right like those are all very

575
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,280
there's a lot of consensus around what

576
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:19,798
those things feel like but with cannabis

577
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,339
it's far less clear that what I'm

578
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:24,960
experiencing is what you're experiencing

579
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:26,459
and you know it's very common that you

580
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,558
might be at a party or something and

581
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,259
people are passing a j around and some

582
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,298
people are talkative and fine and keep

583
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,980
taking toke after toke and others are

584
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:37,259
very quiet and sitting on the couch by

585
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,538
themselves right so we know that even

586
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:42,240
even the literal same joint has

587
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:45,000
different effects in different people so

588
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,460
you know I think that this this paper

589
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,400
really demonstrates that we owe it to

590
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:55,100
our consumers to give them choices right

591
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,080
we want them to have ipas and you know

592
00:24:55,099 --> 00:25:01,139
naturally naturally fermented skin

593
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,839
contact white wines and you know we also

594
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,360
need Commodities like Anheuser-Busch you

595
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,579
know whatever you know that we just need

596
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,918
to have a range of choices

597
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:14,538
um and that those choices a consumers

598
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,538
should be able to choose on the base

599
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,720
absolutely yo and you brought up a great

600
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,519
point when you were talking about how

601
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,019
you know the same joint can have

602
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,019
different effects on different people

603
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:28,980
and it it made me curious too going back

604
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:30,839
to your results here and people who were

605
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,558
rating cannabis for the pleasurable

606
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:37,019
effects were those pleasurable

607
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:39,178
effects actually subjective too meaning

608
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:42,240
did people

609
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:44,820
were they looking for an energetic High

610
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,798
versus a sleepy high like was there

611
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:49,079
differences there too that you sort of

612
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,298
had to layer in yeah that's a great

613
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:54,960
question so the the anchoring question

614
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:57,538
that we used for our volunteers was what

615
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,360
do you consider a good cannabis

616
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:03,298
experience right and so we gave them a

617
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:05,038
range of answers from I don't want to

618
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:07,558
feel anything at all I want to feel

619
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,480
totally normal to I want to be so high

620
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:10,980
that it's almost uncomfortable so they

621
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,480
have you know some choices in between

622
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:18,298
there and regardless of you know their

623
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,278
age or how frequently they consume

624
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:22,679
cannabis the vast majority of people

625
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,900
reported that they wanted a prominent

626
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,659
shift from their normal State of

627
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,940
Consciousness so regardless of people's

628
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:31,980
tolerance or or you know the products

629
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,259
they prefer or their experience with

630
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,120
cannabis or any other factors most

631
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,980
people are looking to feel

632
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:39,538
quite a bit different than their normal

633
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,120
daily life

634
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:45,298
so so that's that's the way that we sort

635
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:48,479
of typified you know what what the yeah

636
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:50,099
what the volunteers look like

637
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,839
and another thing that that stood out to

638
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,240
me when I was reading the paper was that

639
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:58,339
smaller amounts of cannabis consumed

640
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,339
actually had better subjective appeal

641
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,340
the answer to this it probably has

642
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:08,158
something to do with the fact that

643
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:10,918
people self titrate how much cannabis

644
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,380
they use so Carrie Cutler at Washington

645
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,960
State University is a wonderful like

646
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,679
mine she's shown this very elegantly by

647
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,778
having people smoke and take dabs over

648
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:24,500
Zoom calls and

649
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:27,900
um she shows that you know

650
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,538
people who are using higher more more

651
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,538
potent products they tend to take fewer

652
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:36,480
Puffs and hold it in less amount of time

653
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:38,220
so there seems to be you know this

654
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,778
effect where people especially because

655
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,538
you know this is a double-blind

656
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:45,119
evaluation so people don't know the the

657
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:46,980
strength of the products they're trying

658
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,259
and so

659
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,360
um probably what's happening is that you

660
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,700
know they'll pack a small bowl or you

661
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,759
know light the end of a joint and take

662
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,798
one puff and kind of see where they are

663
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:01,740
and then they stop because they're happy

664
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,658
where they are so it may be you know an

665
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,000
artifact in the data that you know the

666
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:08,220
vast majority of people just smoked very

667
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,380
small amounts of cannabis and of course

668
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,480
you know wherever the data is stacked

669
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,039
that's where you're going to find all of

670
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,740
those results

671
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,599
uh okay that makes sense

672
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,079
um uh another thing here the less

673
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:24,719
frequent cannabis users reported better

674
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:26,220
subjective uh scores yes this was really

675
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,860
interesting

676
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,778
um and I this is really a mystery to me

677
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:33,298
I don't I don't have a hypothesis for

678
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:35,700
why this might be you know in the

679
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:37,558
process of the peer review our referees

680
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,080
asked us well is this because of

681
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,339
Tolerance is it because these these

682
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,278
these no

683
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:46,139
um they're able to register the pleasant

684
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,359
effects of cannabis because they're not

685
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,700
using it as often

686
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:53,278
um and that could be contributing to

687
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,740
some extent but we also asked all of our

688
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:59,339
participants to take a 48-hour tolerance

689
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,099
break before they started their kits and

690
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:03,899
we also gave them at least 30 days to

691
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:06,599
complete you know all of the samples

692
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,580
between 8 and 10 seconds couples

693
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,038
um and it was just it's just you know we

694
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:12,599
might have had a handful of Judges who

695
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,019
you know were all we're already daily

696
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:15,019
users

697
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,919
one day after the other but you know

698
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:25,140
most of the people in the study like the

699
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,120
vast majority

700
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,220
um you know a spaced amount really

701
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,079
nicely and they adhered you know more

702
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,899
than 80 of the people adhered to the

703
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:36,139
tolerance breaks sort of guidance so I

704
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:40,558
don't necessarily think tolerance

705
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:42,600
entirely explains that phenomenon

706
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,519
um I think it might

707
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,839
you know if I had to like if I'm if

708
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,940
you're gonna put me on the spot to give

709
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,139
you an answer I would say it's maybe

710
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,778
just like

711
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,360
you know it's the idea that it's not a

712
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:58,079
party if it happens every day yeah it's

713
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,000
just more special if it is you know not

714
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,519
as often

715
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,980
um we our brains habituate to our

716
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:08,038
environments and our you know um our

717
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,140
situations and it just might not feel as

718
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:11,339
special or fun or cool if it happens

719
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,860
more frequent

720
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:15,240
yeah no and I think that the whole idea

721
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,719
of Tolerance too it's a bit of a

722
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,640
double-edged sword where if you if

723
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,500
you're taking breaks you might be more

724
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,419
sensitive to the positive aspects of

725
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,159
cannabis but you're also more sensitive

726
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:28,980
to the negative aspects too with the

727
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,260
paranoia anxiety or anything like that

728
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,000
Bingo exactly and this is actually

729
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:36,778
something that we actively work with

730
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,380
with our chronic pain patients so in my

731
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:42,659
other studies you know we work with

732
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,360
um you know people who are starting to

733
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:49,559
use cannabis to manage their Orthopedic

734
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:53,038
pain and it's a process of developing

735
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:55,859
enough tolerance to reap the medical

736
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,778
benefits of cannabis because of course

737
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:59,699
you know initially for for some of our

738
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:01,798
folks and this these are also you know a

739
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,220
lot of older folks with Orthopedic you

740
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:08,759
know issues arthritis and you know hip

741
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,798
replacements and things and um you know

742
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:13,140
growing up in the Nixon era of

743
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,859
prohibition I I you know it's no wonder

744
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,860
that they're hesitant

745
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,240
we specifically go through a sort of

746
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:25,798
ramp up the start low go slow kind of

747
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,019
mentality

748
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:31,019
um is the best way to get our patients

749
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:34,019
up to a level of you know THC

750
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:35,819
consumption that sufficiently eliminates

751
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:38,460
their pain but they've built up enough

752
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:40,139
of a sort of psychological tolerance to

753
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,298
it that they're in a comfortable

754
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,520
headspace

755
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:46,619
yeah and it it's funny you bring that up

756
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,679
I've been looking through

757
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:52,019
some videos from our press past kamed

758
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,640
conference getting ready for for the one

759
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:56,460
that's coming up and I was looking at a

760
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,559
presentation from Dr Dustin sulak that

761
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,200
was part of our medical practicum and

762
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,658
and he was talking about this you know

763
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,700
that therapeutic window and you know you

764
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,440
need to get up to a point where you're

765
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,000
feeling the effects

766
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,278
um but you don't want to necessarily

767
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,419
exceed that either or else you know you

768
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,460
can kind of get to a point of

769
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:16,620
diminishing returns and then you have to

770
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,058
actually you know take a step back or

771
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:19,739
lower the dose which is sort of

772
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:21,359
counter-intuitive

773
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,159
um so it's sort of interesting how you

774
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,199
need to really find that sweet spot I

775
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,120
absolutely you know Dustin and I are

776
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,000
very close colleagues we see you know

777
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,038
eye to eye on this issue and that idea

778
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,380
of the therapeutic window for our

779
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:36,599
patients is not exclusive to our

780
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,880
patients you know but for for the adult

781
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,859
use Market I tend to refer to it as the

782
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,539
sweet spot right you got to stay in your

783
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:45,959
sweet spot and if your tolerance has

784
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:48,298
gotten so high that you can't get up

785
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,038
into The Sweet Spot anymore then it's

786
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:52,619
time for a tolerance break and our

787
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:53,759
brains are remarkably responsive to

788
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:55,500
tolerance

789
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,599
you know like

790
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,298
um that I haven't seen quite enough

791
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:03,298
literature to satisfy me on on all of my

792
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:05,099
hypotheses around tolerance but um but

793
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,200
from all of the you know the limited

794
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:08,819
literature there is and all of the heaps

795
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,240
of anecdotal data that are out there

796
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:15,960
taking a tolerance break really works

797
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,140
excellent all right 80. um before I let

798
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,659
you go I wanted to give you a chance to

799
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,159
um plug any other resources related to

800
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,919
this that you think that our listeners

801
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,778
would like to read up more about or any

802
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,460
of your own social media or websites or

803
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:33,619
anything like that please let me know

804
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,620
and I'll put it in the show notes sure

805
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:45,240
on Instagram I'm at Dr period 80. Edie

806
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:46,919
um Dr period Adie

807
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,200
um so that's that's probably the the

808
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,000
easiest way to get a hold of me or to

809
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,100
find out you know what other work I'm

810
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,359
I'm producing

811
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:59,158
um and uh let's see I would say that in

812
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,019
general other things that I you know

813
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,580
think might be timely to highlight are

814
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,980
just the fact that

815
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:07,678
um you know right now we're speaking in

816
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:11,338
mid-December and there is a ton of

817
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,720
outdoor flower that's curing and

818
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:14,820
um that's gonna hit the dispensary

819
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,579
shelves you know probably early January

820
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,460
and outdoor flower in particular because

821
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:22,918
the outdoor environment is so you know

822
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,079
diverse and unpredictable that means the

823
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:27,719
chemistry in those outdoor flowers tends

824
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,398
to be more diverse also so

825
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,598
um if you're a cannabis consumer and

826
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:33,059
you're listening to this I would

827
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,859
encourage you to you know ask your bud

828
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:36,539
tender which smell the best and which

829
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:38,398
ones were grown outside and just

830
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:40,079
especially support your regenerative

831
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,838
Farms

832
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,579
excellent excellent well 80. thank you

833
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:46,799
