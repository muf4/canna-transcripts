1
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:12,669
hi everybody thanks so much for being

2
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:15,070
here today thanks for for John for his

3
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:17,230
his talk which is very enlightening and

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,240
I look forward to following up with with

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,000
some details on some of the things that

6
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:24,879
we've been up to in British Columbia as

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,240
well as with my colleagues Cindy or sir

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:33,009
and Aaron Hilliard from digi paths labs

9
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:34,929
in Las Vegas essentially you'll notice

10
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,909
that there's a there's gonna be a lot of

11
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:40,149
parallels there with with John's talk so

12
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:42,759
I think we've seen these illustrations

13
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:46,359
of the plant morphology and I like to

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,429
refer to to cannabis as essentially a

15
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:51,129
single species with multiple gene pools

16
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:54,609
and as we all know and what we've talked

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:56,500
about a lot today is the fact that the

18
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:59,259
influence of cannabis and humans and

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,700
vice versa has been nearly

20
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,280
disproportionate in nature in the sense

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,560
that what you can see here on this

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,259
current map is what I would say is the

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,388
origin of different morphologies of

24
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:12,759
cannabis without referring to to

25
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:14,739
anything more than just a morphology and

26
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:18,429
the size of the leaves so you see a

27
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:21,188
narrow leaf hemp nlh kind of in europe

28
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:22,899
they're the broadleaf drug type and the

29
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:25,928
narrow leaf drug type which those would

30
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:27,700
be the indica sativa of the recreational

31
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:30,159
or the medical market and then the

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,209
broadleaf hemp which is more thought of

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,459
as being the Chinese hemp so essentially

34
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:39,130
these would be the you know kind of a

35
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:42,099
primer of where the plants emerged and

36
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:45,728
evolved and essentially as we know it's

37
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:48,278
moved around the world and there's

38
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,769
hybrids between most likely all of those

39
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:52,658
gene pools at this point broad leaf and

40
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:55,569
narrow leaf hemp have hybrids and

41
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,009
obviously I think when we refer to drug

42
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:00,099
tag cannabis these days we're really

43
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:03,728
referring to a large hybrid gene pool of

44
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:05,919
both broadleaf drug type and narrow leaf

45
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:08,228
drug type so afgan occur and kind of

46
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:11,280
South Asia origin with some of the

47
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,060
autoflowering traits and possibly

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,800
specifically autoflowering traits

49
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,780
originating from northern latitudes so

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,219
typically European hemp that was

51
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,890
intrigued rest

52
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:24,849
but in essence you know what we see is

53
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:26,619
that we have a natural process of moving

54
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,439
a plant around the world and then we

55
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,719
have the impact of artificial selection

56
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:35,109
like humans have had on any other crop

57
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:38,439
and here's a here's of paper from Ernie

58
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,180
small who essentially illustrates what

59
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:42,460
this means and so we have on the one

60
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,620
side the fiber cultivars and then we

61
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,120
have more than narcotic cultivars and

62
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,819
the concept here is that there was

63
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,890
divergent selection selective pressures

64
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,509
by the people that were essentially

65
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,679
collect with these plants and then

66
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:55,899
selected them for very different reasons

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,080
whether you know let's say broad

68
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,050
categories of drug cultivars vs. ham

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,450
cultivars this relates to this is the

70
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,130
same paper or not a paper by a very

71
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,539
small as well but this relates to the

72
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:09,699
question everybody asked hey let's get

73
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:11,620
you know is it good to do commodity

74
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:13,539
cannabinoids from ham grown outdoors or

75
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,860
are we better off focusing on you know

76
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:17,039
growing indoor in a controlled

77
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,660
environment a dropped drug track

78
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,310
cannabis so essentially what you see

79
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,379
here and what this table shows is that

80
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,709
there is a significant difference in

81
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:29,949
between the size of trichomes in drug

82
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:33,370
type cannabis versus fiber type cannabis

83
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:36,009
over hand versus marijuana there is here

84
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,519
essentially almost a you know one point

85
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:41,739
six time largest size of trichomes in in

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,560
drug cannabis so essentially you can see

87
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,569
that this plant was purpose bred for

88
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,099
resin production so essentially having

89
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,739
larger trichomes maybe more numerous

90
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,810
trichomes is also one of the key

91
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,009
features there and essentially for me at

92
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,569
this point in time I think that's the

93
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:57,639
large difference between Hampton and

94
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,709
cannabis is really the you know that's

95
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,109
why we cap at 5% when we're talking hemp

96
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:06,310
that hasn't been integrated with that

97
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,080
key trait of resin production I'm not

98
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,489
going to go over the the solid paper

99
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,969
because obviously it was just covered

100
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,620
but what I did do here is is essentially

101
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:17,918
delve a little bit deeper into that that

102
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,478
concept of the divergence between these

103
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,269
two gene pools in particularly European

104
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:24,668
hemp and drug type cannabis and this is

105
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:28,629
work done recently published at the end

106
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:29,978
of 2017 by a group that I did my

107
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,329
undergrad thesis and my master's thesis

108
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,990
at the University of Lausanne in

109
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:36,399
Switzerland where I'm

110
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:39,579
from so essentially my my master's

111
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,739
advisor Dahomey Gouda and one of my my

112
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,629
committee members were the lead

113
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,360
investigators on this study and the

114
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:48,790
interesting part about this study is

115
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,310
that they used the type of genetic

116
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,379
markers called single sequence repeat or

117
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,079
microsatellites and the interesting part

118
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:58,420
with those is that those markers are

119
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,129
typically thought to not be under the

120
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,259
effect of selection so they are

121
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,029
typically thought of being neutral so it

122
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,889
means that it's it's basically immune to

123
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:07,959
the effect of people moving stuff around

124
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,269
and essentially moreso breeding for

125
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,310
specific purposes so neutral areas of

126
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:14,620
the genome they don't code for genes but

127
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,600
they might be associated with genes so I

128
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,920
think it makes more sense to use neutral

129
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,220
markers when we're trying to decipher

130
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,540
the evolutionary history of a particular

131
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,850
you know a particular structure that

132
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,660
we're observing and in this case here we

133
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:32,379
do see as you can see here from the the

134
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,610
green plot on the right there every

135
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:36,909
single one of these bars is an

136
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:39,189
individual plant so there's a 1234

137
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,800
plants sampled here out of 48

138
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:44,769
populations and I think this is probably

139
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,319
the first population level study on

140
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:48,909
cannabis sativa where we have you know

141
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,319
thousands of individuals and thousands

142
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,410
of populations

143
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,740
so essentially red and green separates

144
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:59,560
that these two gene pools between HAMP

145
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:03,340
and and drug type cannabis and then you

146
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,769
see that there is essentially you know a

147
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:07,209
clear pattern of structure but there's

148
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:10,750
there's not not much more that we can

149
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:13,139
see from this image so thankfully to do

150
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,850
these authors they they essentially

151
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,699
shared their data so I downloaded the

152
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:21,040
data from from the +1 website and

153
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:24,219
repeated those analyses and added some

154
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,620
essentially labels to it but also going

155
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,460
beyond that seeing a particular

156
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,740
structure where we have on the top right

157
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:35,560
essentially the monoecious varieties of

158
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:38,110
European hemp and and as we as we go

159
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,030
kind of from the the blue colored to the

160
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,110
yellow colored we're now going towards

161
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:44,589
dioecious hams

162
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,180
so essentially mono ashes have been a

163
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,399
hermaphrodite

164
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,410
variety as opposed to dioecious gonna be

165
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,939
more what we're what what's coming for

166
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,710
us to understand that we have both a

167
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,120
male and a female plant and it's

168
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:58,478
interesting to see and it makes sense

169
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,750
there that obviously the dioecious hamp

170
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:05,050
a cluster closer to to the narrow leaf

171
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,689
drug type and then we see essentially

172
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,220
divergence towards the broadleaf indica

173
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,228
afghan occur whatever we want to call it

174
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,710
but it really is quite interesting that

175
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:17,939
we can we can tease apart a pattern here

176
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:20,500
from you know a larger a larger pool of

177
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,449
samples than what had been seen

178
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,970
previously using you know single

179
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:28,478
nucleotide polymorphism which are you

180
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:32,020
know possibly both functional or under

181
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:34,870
selection and also neutral so I want to

182
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,459
talk more about snips John mentioned

183
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,459
them essentially this is what they look

184
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:41,348
like here it's a single pair difference

185
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:45,579
on a sequence it's one of the most

186
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:47,680
common some one of the common sources of

187
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,209
polymer polymorphisms so essentially the

188
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,848
source of variation that's the most

189
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:54,339
commonly found it is typically thought

190
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:57,550
to arise from a mistake in replication

191
00:07:54,339 --> 00:08:00,728
from one basically from one cell cycle

192
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,800
to the next and it's also one of the

193
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:05,110
means of you know generating diversity

194
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,199
so using mutagens and things like that

195
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,819
but nature does it all on its own it

196
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,129
doesn't necessarily require us and

197
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,228
typically we see an average frequency of

198
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:15,639
about one snip for every thousand base

199
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,870
pairs and when we're talking about the

200
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,668
cannabis genome we see that that's

201
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,649
actually there's actually quite a bit

202
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:23,158
more snips so large amount of diversity

203
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:28,269
about one snip every 100 base pairs in

204
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:29,978
cannabis so essentially what I want to

205
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:31,629
talk about here and this is an example

206
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:35,319
from one of the licensed producers in

207
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:37,870
Canada that I I knew their horticultural

208
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,909
director and they came he came to me and

209
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,500
said something very interesting happened

210
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:43,208
in in one of our strains that we bought

211
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,809
from the BC bud depo which is probably

212
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:48,039
not the most recognized seed source but

213
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:50,528
essentially they have a variety called

214
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,809
shiatsu cush which they claim is from

215
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:55,480
Japan which it's not but it's typically

216
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:57,699
a high THC variety and then here in this

217
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,050
case as you can see something happened

218
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,660
in the production line that

219
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:08,229
caused one plant to express CBG inequal

220
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:11,528
almost an equal concentration to to THC

221
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,730
acid so it doesn't have to be a mutation

222
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:14,409
it could be something else if it be an

223
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,839
insertion of a transportable element

224
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:18,549
right inside of an active THC a synthase

225
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,370
gene but it's really quite interesting

226
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:24,099
how one of the reasons why they pick

227
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,409
this up is because they have to they

228
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,409
have to QA QC test their products and

229
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:31,600
when you when the when the one sample

230
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:32,679
test comes back with a high c BG they

231
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,970
don't believe that it's happening so

232
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,278
they resend the same plant and they see

233
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,040
that actually something happened to one

234
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,620
of the clones and I'm happy to see that

235
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,439
they're actually producing it as a plant

236
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,240
and offering and you know as medicine to

237
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,910
people that that would be interested in

238
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,950
having access to different minor

239
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:52,689
cannabinoids so these things can happen

240
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,690
you know if a mutation can happen in a

241
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,200
you know small AC MPR greenhouse or

242
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,670
a grow house in Whistler Canada you know

243
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,899
it it's definitely happening in those

244
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,789
fields out there all the time we're just

245
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:07,208
not looking for it because of the scales

246
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:08,708
were growing at so this is something

247
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,838
that I that I did is essentially using

248
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,369
data from from medicinal genomics and I

249
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,060
you know part of the reason why I'm here

250
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,950
is because of the philosophy of sharing

251
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:19,539
this type of information with people to

252
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,000
be able to you know there's a lot of

253
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:24,370
information we can't all you know go

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,309
through it and decipher it so here's an

255
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,009
example and I've got the NRC logo up

256
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:31,899
here and that's a little bit of a wave

257
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,059
to you John page because as you see the

258
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,278
USO 31 and the phenol as samples there

259
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,649
came from them so this is all in silico

260
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:42,159
data downloaded from the internet and

261
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:44,850
again thanks to medicinal genomics and

262
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:48,009
in john's group for sharing that data

263
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,199
essentially what I do is is use

264
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,600
statistical approaches to be able to now

265
00:10:50,198 --> 00:10:53,948
you know decipher genomics and make it a

266
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,110
little bit more approachable and maybe

267
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:57,219
fast-track some of these developments as

268
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,620
we're talking about marker assisted

269
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,149
selection so here you see that the

270
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,190
clustering like we said we've got fin

271
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,169
all out there hemp and then we have the

272
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,910
drug type cannabis that have some kind

273
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:10,028
of a structure but again this is done

274
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:11,189
with 28 accessions and starting with a

275
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:16,330
hundred and

276
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:18,720
180,000 dataset 180,000 snips so what I

277
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:20,980
did is in silico I managed to use

278
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,660
statistical analyses like discriminant

279
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,509
analysis the principal component to

280
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:28,500
reduce this 180,000 snip dataset to a

281
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:31,480
set of 42 that in silico on the computer

282
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,769
provided the exact same pattern and

283
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,460
here's something that I did also way

284
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,659
back in a day a 3d PCA that then was

285
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,910
used by some other groups that are

286
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,899
presenting their data in you know in a

287
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:42,549
fashion like this but it's the same

288
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,350
principle here we see that there is a

289
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:51,659
clustering going on but again you know a

290
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:54,909
very basic structure that we see so

291
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:57,480
here's what I set out to do with it with

292
00:11:54,909 --> 00:12:00,569
another follow-up study in 2017 was

293
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,220
essentially compared to indica sativa

294
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,860
paradigm so what I took data from the

295
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,840
internet on terpene expression and then

296
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,300
what I did there is that I forced the

297
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,250
software to say ok on the Left here I'm

298
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,870
going to say indica sativa hybrid how do

299
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,730
they differentiate themselves that you

300
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,990
can see they're all overlapping and I

301
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,960
tested a couple of options including

302
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,980
some of what the name Pro Research had

303
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,430
done which they said I think it was

304
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,240
limonene caryophyllene and mersin so I

305
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:30,669
did that and I did another essentially

306
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,279
clustering possibility which was mersin

307
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,719
turpentine and limonene as you can see

308
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,789
this was kind of what was the best a

309
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,870
cluster that I showed and essentially

310
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,000
what I did from that is I took the

311
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,340
genetic data constrained it based on

312
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,710
these three classes and was able to have

313
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,210
a data set that that almost perfectly

314
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,610
clustered these groups into their

315
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:51,610
relevant groups here this is more of a

316
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,019
proof of concept but essentially this

317
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,289
data is available on the internet I have

318
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:57,970
these 21 markers that are available for

319
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:00,069
people to download and play with and

320
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,210
again this is really just digested

321
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:06,280
information from from canopy dia so the

322
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,019
study with with terpenes and digi paths

323
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,829
really kind of came as a follow up to

324
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:14,169
that and you know going from you know 70

325
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,570
something samples do now about 5,000

326
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,829
samples and this is all terpene data so

327
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,810
you see all of the variables there

328
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,050
limonene blah blah and you see how

329
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:24,509
essentially the software can

330
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:26,278
clustered these groups into into three

331
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:28,439
different groups and this is just drug

332
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,360
time cannabis but typically you know

333
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,240
Amer seen better Curie often in dominant

334
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,129
and red atropine and lean dominant group

335
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,570
and an alignment in dominant group with

336
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,919
obviously some other terpenes in there

337
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,480
but we get a really consistent

338
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,699
clustering of these three groups based

339
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,769
on their on their chemo chemo chemo

340
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,990
tipic data so what I did is the same

341
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,750
kind of concept using fancy statistics

342
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:52,320
to to simplify and and really actually

343
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:55,440
generate synthetic variables called

344
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,540
principal components and and here what

345
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,339
you can see is out of those five

346
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:01,349
thousand individuals seventy samples

347
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,180
that were a sequence essentially with a

348
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,269
similar genotyping by sequencing

349
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:08,159
approach by medicinal genomics and you

350
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:10,019
see that there is there still that

351
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,159
cluster still holds essentially and

352
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,439
there's still some there's some overlap

353
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,990
there and this it's not a perfect fit

354
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,830
but essentially from that data set I was

355
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:22,799
able to to generate 48 sets of primers

356
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,259
that I wanted to validate from the in

357
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,669
silico on the computer studies to now

358
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:28,649
being able to say we can do this in the

359
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:30,929
lab in a repeatable fashion so

360
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:33,570
interestingly out of 48 markers we

361
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:35,429
really only had about 23 that were

362
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,200
validated so nine of them just never

363
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:40,169
even amplified so I think it's based on

364
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,810
the large amount of snips in the priming

365
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:45,269
areas of the primers we found that

366
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:47,669
sixteen that showed polymorphism on on

367
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:51,240
in silico data were actually monomorphic

368
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:53,639
even between hemp and cannabis and three

369
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,990
minutes essentially that out of that 18

370
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,449
of them were associated with terpene

371
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,610
expression as well and here's just an

372
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,759
idea of the assignment where we compare

373
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:05,360
the the genome GBS or 10,000 snips

374
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,370
against 18 snips you can see that the

375
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,350
the statistical assignment to the

376
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,389
different groups is very very close you

377
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,750
know with essentially a thousand times

378
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:16,970
less markers and this is also being

379
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,070
confirmed by some other groups

380
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,110
essentially this is a study out of New

381
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,270
Mexico that shows the same kind of

382
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,659
clustering in Mersin terpene and lean

383
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:29,819
and limonene and this is something that

384
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,259
i validated with the licensed producer

385
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,240
in british columbia that i work with

386
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,019
called the flower corporation where

387
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,120
essentially now we've taken we

388
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:39,220
see HAMP here clustering by itself and

389
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,950
those are ex 59 and finola samples a

390
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,389
Mersin dominant group what we see here

391
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,740
is the little cloud the green cloud

392
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:46,899
that's actually a piney and dominant

393
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,960
accession that has pining and mersin but

394
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:53,409
piney is quite a bit higher and and you

395
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,580
can see at the bottom the pink is is ham

396
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:56,500
samples and so they're not all

397
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,900
distributed in one part but they you can

398
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,000
identify them very easily with this with

399
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:02,769
this approach I'm not sure what this is

400
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,240
I don't see it but this is interesting

401
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:06,460
I'm showing the same data here and what

402
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,110
it shows is the the markers that are

403
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,410
associated with the clustering is on the

404
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:13,090
top left there is hemp and we see my toe

405
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:17,049
so it's a mitochondrial marker that's

406
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,519
always fixed in hemp and then sw6 which

407
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:20,289
is actually a cheese synthase marker

408
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,889
that I developed that enable you to

409
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:28,889
irrefutably identify hemp so CBD hemp

410
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:31,149
versus CBD drug type cannabis anyways

411
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,679
and then the same when you look at HAMP

412
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,139
there's different phenotypes in the

413
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,370
fields that are also associated with you

414
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,799
know the height and also the the

415
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,500
fragrance of the plants and then again

416
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,569
you know the last thing that that I did

417
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,909
is essentially take these small set of

418
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,310
markers so actually just 23 of them and

419
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:50,230
I took all the data from canopy dia when

420
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:52,179
I wanted to see how how you know if

421
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,129
we're able to identify strains and again

422
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,899
here identified a few of them but one of

423
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:57,580
the well you know one of the the data

424
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,519
that that they show is a glute

425
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,780
clustering and a lot of the blue dream

426
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,000
accessions and the same of the Durbin

427
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:05,319
poison so it's just nice to see that you

428
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,319
know this actually translate across

429
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,000
across the board and thank you so much

430
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,720
everybody for the attention not much

431
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,720
time for questions
