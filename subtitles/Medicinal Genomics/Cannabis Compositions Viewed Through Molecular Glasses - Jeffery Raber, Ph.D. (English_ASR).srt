1
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,230
thank you thank you all for coming back

2
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:12,308
after lunch

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,059
congratulations Don sorry wasn't a Mega

4
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:18,250
Millions ticket but a good job so I'm a

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,589
chemist by trade PhD in organic

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,300
chemistry background in biochemistry as

7
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:25,059
well and I thought I'd talk a little bit

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,730
from a molecular perspective what we're

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:29,949
seeing in the marketplace in 2010 we

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,289
started as an analytical testing lab

11
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,719
providing independent testing services

12
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:37,539
in California and through that we

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,160
certainly learned a whole deal a great

14
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:41,079
deal about what was in each of the

15
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,898
cannabis products what's not supposed to

16
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,149
be in them as well and finally we're

17
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,189
starting to see legislated and regulated

18
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:51,549
testing that is mandatory in the state

19
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:52,988
of California which is a great wonderful

20
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:54,788
thing because there certainly are a

21
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:56,858
number of contaminants that we need to

22
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:59,620
concern ourselves with especially when

23
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:03,190
providing patient medicines as these are

24
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:04,870
today so I think most of us in the crowd

25
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,819
are relatively well aware that there are

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,010
a lot of molecules in cannabis it's

27
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:11,078
certainly one of the things that excited

28
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,909
me as a chemist and as a medical

29
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:15,548
purveyor to say there are a lot of tools

30
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:17,320
that could be provided to doctors to the

31
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:20,079
medical community and lots of options

32
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,328
that could be provided to patients the

33
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:23,709
last count that I had heard was it's

34
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:26,078
around you know twelve hundred and

35
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:29,078
seventy different chemicals are known to

36
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:31,179
be present in and on cannabis the plan

37
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:32,828
itself makes some others are degra dense

38
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,180
through natural degradation processes

39
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:38,589
and other metabolic pathways as well

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,750
they're around 144 different

41
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,700
cannabinoids the cannabinoid acids being

42
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,289
the ones that the plant produces itself

43
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,320
and the neutral cannabinoids being the

44
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:48,759
ones that are degraded from heat

45
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,158
terpenes and terpenoids were something

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,069
when we first started in 2010 that most

47
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,439
people had never really heard of in the

48
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:59,228
general lexicon and i think what we did

49
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:02,529
in 2011 was begin offering testing for

50
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:04,450
terpenes and Turkey and gave that test

51
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,060
away for a few months so that people

52
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,890
would see the importance of it

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,899
fortunately today we can see that almost

54
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,759
everyone wants to talk about terpenes

55
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,818
it's very chirpy there's a lot of Terp

56
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:18,519
sauce out there which is entertaining to

57
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:19,259
me as a scientist but it's a good sign

58
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,360
that everyone

59
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:23,280
talking about them there's a lot of the

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,080
magic that comes from cannabis and what

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,939
makes it much more useful as a medicine

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,830
than other types of therapeutic

63
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,348
approaches or that it has this host of

64
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,390
molecules to offer all at once not only

65
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:35,939
a single molecule type perspective so

66
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:38,458
it's not one lock in one key it's many

67
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,780
many molecules being offered to the body

68
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,450
and allowing the body to end it

69
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,180
intelligently select which ones may be

70
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:47,639
most useful to it unfortunately most of

71
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,980
them are very very safe to the body so

72
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,919
what we see in most of the cannabis

73
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:55,709
products are typical ratios that you

74
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,969
hear of the major cannabinoids THC a THC

75
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:02,128
CBD predominantly Reporters THC and CBD

76
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:05,310
ratios but the plan again makes THC

77
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:08,459
acids and you see every you know most

78
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:12,120
types of ratios 1 2 1 2 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 2

79
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,219
and greater than 15 or 20 - one of a

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,310
predominant cannabinoid and many minor

81
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,199
cannabinoids as well the plant ratios

82
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,150
are much more restricted than what you

83
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,280
can get from products that are produced

84
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,780
so extractive products processed

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,090
products you can blend those ratios

86
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,340
virtually to anything you could imagine

87
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,439
and we're starting to see a lot more of

88
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,200
that approach as we got license holders

89
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,759
being able to manufacture in consistent

90
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,119
basis and they can produce these

91
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,129
standardized ratios we're also seeing as

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,739
I said more reporting about terpenes and

93
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:46,168
terpenoids the prominent ones are

94
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,959
limonene Mersin Kari awfully in the

95
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,480
Pennines and Linn oval and those are I

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,159
believe driving a lot of the therapeutic

97
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,199
and medicinal effects of the

98
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,060
cannabinoids and making the cannabis

99
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,429
composition what we like to refer to it

100
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,709
as much more effective than just one

101
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,290
cannabinoid or one terpene by itself I

102
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,239
like the word ensembl effect I know

103
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:08,159
entourage effect has been popularized

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,109
but ensembl makes us think of all of

105
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,848
them at once it's not just one molecule

106
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:13,290
and a bunch of other little players but

107
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:15,619
they're all important making that

108
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:18,180
all-important cannabis composition I

109
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,310
think there's a lot of data that says

110
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,228
there's some utility for single

111
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,598
molecules we see those medicines in

112
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,430
Marinella nepo dialects heard a great

113
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,490
presentation from Alice earlier today on

114
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,590
epidural X

115
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,060
and putting more than one together as

116
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:33,098
sativex and that seems to be very

117
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,470
therapeutically effective as well for

118
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:37,209
some but when you can add many many more

119
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,190
of them you start to see a broader base

120
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:42,549
utility broader-based efficaciousness

121
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:44,649
and much greater you know response from

122
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,569
a broad patient population so there's

123
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:49,299
been some good work out of Israel from

124
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:51,129
Ruth Galilee that demonstrated CBD by

125
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,220
itself was not as therapeutically

126
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:57,909
effective as a whole plant spectrum or a

127
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,190
cannabis concentrate containing CBD now

128
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,990
a lot of the times these concentrates or

129
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:03,579
other products are not well classified

130
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,038
or characterized and it can be difficult

131
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,959
from a research perspective to really

132
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:09,579
know all of the molecules that are in

133
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,709
there and I believe we'll hear more from

134
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:13,209
Dede Mary about that he's been doing a

135
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:15,219
great deal of work in that respects all

136
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:16,810
of the molecules are what makes this

137
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,000
really important leading to a great

138
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,800
synergistic factor like one plus one

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,110
does not equal to it equals more than

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,699
that for some reasons we have the

141
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,860
further complexity with cannabis

142
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,509
products and then it's not just one

143
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,120
product right so the regulator would

144
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:32,379
love to think it's just cannabis but I

145
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,728
think everybody that knows these

146
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:35,949
products knows that there are a large

147
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:38,379
plethora of product types from plant

148
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,639
material to concentrated forms and then

149
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,250
all the derivative products that can

150
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,509
come from concentrates add to that that

151
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,459
you can take them in a variety of

152
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,199
different ways from inhalation to oral

153
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:50,198
consumption topicals and even

154
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,449
sublinguals so we have a large kind of

155
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,038
panacea of opportunity but with that

156
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,280
complexity comes the challenge of

157
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:59,589
finding what's right for which patient

158
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,689
we demonstrated in 2015 and published

159
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:04,658
this in the natural products chemistry

160
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:06,069
and research journal that chemo typing

161
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:08,019
is going to be exceptionally important

162
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,460
to understanding which medicines and

163
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:11,439
product types were giving to which

164
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:13,269
patients and when so if we don't

165
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,009
understand the compositions and what

166
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:17,139
we're giving to the patients we're never

167
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,629
going to have a good medical dialog or

168
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,610
one that explains which molecules or

169
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,829
sets of molecules are most important for

170
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,889
which therapeutic effects when delivered

171
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:28,240
in which specific fashions so we've done

172
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,218
this work a lot of others have done

173
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,930
similar types of work and I think we're

174
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:34,120
starting to see at least the scientific

175
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,930
community talk more about chemo typing

176
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,879
which chemo VARs do we have and how

177
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,689
understanding just a cultivar name such

178
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,449
as Oh

179
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:45,040
train wreck or something of that type

180
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,659
doesn't necessarily represent which

181
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,360
types of molecules are present

182
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,710
similarly indica sativa hybrid doesn't

183
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,949
represent which molecules are present

184
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:55,509
either so we do this in 2015 I think

185
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,149
we're making great progress and lo and

186
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,469
behold two weeks ago I see this headline

187
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:02,829
still more evidence that all of it's the

188
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:05,220
same that was rather frustrating Thank

189
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:06,909
You vice media for that one but

190
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,470
fortunately there was a bunch of

191
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,210
community comments they went back and

192
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,430
corrected the article a little bit and

193
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,109
tried to clarify that you know there are

194
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,449
some differences sorry I didn't mean to

195
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,000
say it was all the same this had

196
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:21,550
happened actually before 2015 as well

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,319
but this Karthik 'el didn't comment much

198
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,509
at all about terpenes which we know are

199
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:28,060
great differentiators to the products

200
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:30,610
our data clearly showed that terpenes

201
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,899
were major differentiators in looking at

202
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,150
the cultivars and looking at the

203
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:35,799
different compositions and I believe

204
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:37,629
it's very important that we look at more

205
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,460
than just the cannabinoids or just a few

206
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:41,730
molecules we have to look at many to

207
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:44,229
classify these in the proper fashion

208
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,509
what our data demonstrated was the

209
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,100
indica sativa designation is great for

210
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,870
plant morphology but not for which

211
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,670
chemicals are present nor which

212
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,259
physiological effects you could expect

213
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,300
from those types of molecules being

214
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:57,430
present and we really need to move

215
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,960
towards this chemo typing classification

216
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,579
system and I think it's going to take

217
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,649
the broader community and all of us

218
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:04,479
working together to really assess the

219
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,159
best way of doing that so that we all

220
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,129
don't lose our minds because it's very

221
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,120
complicated there's a large number of

222
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,800
possibilities in a lot of different ways

223
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,840
that you might look at that and we're

224
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,060
gonna have to keep it simple enough to

225
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,509
communicate on a very easy fashion and

226
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,819
really to explain to patients and lay

227
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,379
people who are not science driven what

228
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,930
they're taking and how to find the right

229
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:28,990
medicines for them and that is certainly

230
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,790
going to be a big challenge so it's not

231
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,500
quite so bad when you look at just the

232
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,500
plant and which molecules are present on

233
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,120
the plant but what happens often and

234
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,700
what we're now seeing we were just

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,889
talking earlier that there are about 30%

236
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,710
of the products present in Colorado are

237
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:46,779
in flower or plant matter form the other

238
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,300
products are concentrates extracts or

239
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:51,429
derivatives from those products so it

240
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:53,679
really matters what's happening to all

241
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:54,759
the molecules in that plant composition

242
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,649
as I start to

243
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:59,409
that's it how has that product produced

244
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,299
and made what is the fate of terpenes or

245
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:02,889
other types of volatile molecules as

246
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:06,189
they go through this manufacturing

247
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:08,350
process and really there are a large

248
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,900
number of ways that we might extract or

249
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,250
process the plant material so some of

250
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:13,840
the predominant ones are listed there

251
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,690
water-based methods

252
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,860
rosin pressing is another example

253
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,350
hydrocarbon extraction alcohol

254
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,419
extraction or co2 based methods so I

255
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,730
quite often hear the whole plant

256
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:26,079
extractions um well if I needed the

257
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,279
whole plant why did I bother putting in

258
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,750
the extractor I'll just take the whole

259
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,149
plant press it in a pill like a head and

260
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,639
keep the whole plant in my hand what we

261
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:35,470
hear that were full-spectrum whole plant

262
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,720
I've got all the molecules after I

263
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,519
extracted it now no one here should

264
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,110
believe that they've just left cellulose

265
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,899
behind in the extractor and kept

266
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,250
everything else we really lose a large

267
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,259
number of molecules through the

268
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,779
extraction process and they really

269
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:51,639
change in composition as I go through

270
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,470
that processing methodology if I'm

271
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,529
winterizing it's the process of adding

272
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,320
ethanol cooling the mixture down so if

273
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,789
fats and waxes precipitate filtering

274
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,830
them off and then evaporating the

275
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:04,539
ethanol and as I evaporate the ethanol

276
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,639
I'm also evaporating most of the

277
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:08,559
terpenes because they're of a similar

278
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,139
boiling point and our light volatile

279
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,819
molecules as well so I always ask the

280
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:15,100
question did you winterize how do you

281
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,629
have all of the terpenes and then I get

282
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,029
the crazy look of what am i talking

283
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:20,980
about the problem is most of them are

284
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:23,259
not testing for terpenes or

285
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,450
broader-based composition profiles after

286
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:27,250
they do their manufacturing methods so

287
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,009
we're still left with a lot of strain

288
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,919
names or cultivar names in concentrated

289
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,629
products saying I used jock hair and my

290
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:37,029
extractors so I have a jack hair

291
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:39,070
concentrate but we don't even know how

292
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,409
to clearly define or classify a jack

293
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,390
hair concentrate unless we are to say

294
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:44,860
this many molecules makes up that

295
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,929
composition when they're all in these

296
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,300
ratios then we can go ahead and define

297
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:51,309
them in that fashion and that from a

298
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:52,779
testing perspective we do not see

299
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:56,349
broader-based

300
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:58,600
and really accurate perspectives given

301
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,700
to the concentrates in a sense of which

302
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,409
other terpenes or secondary molecules

303
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,660
might be present in addition to the

304
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:06,399
cannabinoids fortunately California

305
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,629
regulations and laws are going to force

306
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,129
the California market to

307
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:11,990
test and report their terpene

308
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:13,490
compositions if they're going to market

309
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,970
them and put them on their products and

310
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,279
on their label one way that you can go

311
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,740
about standardizing concentrates is the

312
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,389
the fashion that we're taking analyzing

313
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,220
plant material understanding which

314
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,289
components are present and then

315
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,970
rebuilding that composition through

316
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:31,129
individual ingredients to create a

317
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,889
complex formulation that can be

318
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:37,220
standardized consistent reproducible and

319
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:39,470
then add that to concentrates and its

320
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,509
concentrates reach higher purity single

321
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,600
molecule isolates are now available such

322
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:46,669
as CBD or THC acid in high purity you

323
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,879
can create highly complex cannabis

324
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:51,860
compositions that are standardized and

325
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,809
reproducible even at scale and I think

326
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,629
that what we have seen we've been doing

327
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:59,359
this type of work since 2014 filed

328
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:01,970
provisional patents in 2013 on these

329
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,919
methodologies really demonstrates to us

330
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,899
that the cannabinoids can all be the

331
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,789
same but I can put ten different terpene

332
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:10,279
mixtures together and see ten different

333
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:13,429
physiological responses so I think

334
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,889
terpenes are significant drivers to the

335
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,750
overall ensemble or entourage effect and

336
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:19,340
I really believe that holds a lot of the

337
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,379
magic of cannabis and why we're all here

338
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,540
talking about cannabis compositions

339
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:26,509
instead of single molecule eye slits as

340
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:28,909
much we think it's the next step in that

341
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:31,370
is really labeling and properly

342
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:32,990
informing the consumers and patients as

343
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,419
well as the medical community and the

344
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,269
regulator so we've come up with names

345
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:40,250
native inspired and emboldened to try

346
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:41,960
and define which chemicals are being

347
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,299
present in those standardized

348
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,759
formulations and how close to the plant

349
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:48,919
or other types of agents that you might

350
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,350
add for flavor enhancement or even

351
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,969
physiological effect enhancements it's

352
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,920
going to be the next generation I think

353
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,110
of what we tackle with regulators to

354
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:59,059
help inform everybody in a proper

355
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,440
fashion because a good label is really

356
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:04,039
what helps with drive consumer

357
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,110
protection and safety standardizing

358
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,149
those products especially in concentrate

359
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,190
forms then allows you to standardize all

360
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,959
of your delivery platforms so I describe

361
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,180
their inhalation we use that a lot in

362
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,430
vape carts it's also very prevalent for

363
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:18,559
us in tinctures tablets topicals and

364
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:20,689
other derivative products once you have

365
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,579
a concentrate that is very standardized

366
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,980
then you can start to use

367
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,259
in a medical delivery fashion such as a

368
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,269
tablet or a tincture and really have a

369
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:31,189
good dialogue with patients who will be

370
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:33,379
confident that their responses will be

371
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,959
consistent so then we can start to get

372
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,820
solid titratable regimens we can

373
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:40,099
understand the composition because it's

374
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,810
well characterized up to almost 70

375
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,269
different molecules that you know are

376
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:46,159
present which ones at which ratios and

377
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:47,629
high amounts or low amounts and what's

378
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,208
starting to drive these preferred

379
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,320
medical effects it's interesting and I

380
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:54,049
think we still have yet to see how

381
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,910
individualized might cannabis get do we

382
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:57,859
have one composition for one patient

383
00:13:55,909 --> 00:14:00,319
that's very possible we might have cases

384
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,360
like that which compositions might drive

385
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,519
80 you know 50 percent or large

386
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,320
majorities of the market and which ones

387
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,120
do we want to then move into the clinic

388
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,510
so that we can issue that as

389
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,820
standardized medical platforms as well

390
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:15,980
tinctures edibles tablets topicals don't

391
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,510
suffer the same fate as inhalation I

392
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,240
don't have to worry about heating or

393
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,950
other types of things in an Airstream I

394
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,049
know exactly what I'm giving to the

395
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,910
patient via those delivery platforms and

396
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:27,859
dr. Deb Kemalists talked about a tablet

397
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:29,360
composition yesterday I think we're

398
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,600
gonna see more of those offered in

399
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,610
medical states we've seen an theis plant

400
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,339
perspectives on the East Coast from some

401
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,680
regulators I do believe you can

402
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:41,500
standardize plant compositions and uses

403
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,489
for vaporization and inhalation

404
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,100
inhalation offers different metabolic

405
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,659
profiles than oral consumption and we

406
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,278
really should be open-minded and

407
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:51,019
broad-based in our approach to saying

408
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,700
what's right for which patients and

409
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,009
what's best for each individual patient

410
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,690
but it will be a little easier perhaps

411
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,370
to standardize some other derivative

412
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,800
forms than the plant material itself

413
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,379
three minutes and I think what is

414
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,729
repeatable is very important right so as

415
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:06,919
we talk about delivering the same

416
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,810
product to the same patient populations

417
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:11,629
how do we know that they're also using

418
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:13,549
it the same at home what's on the labels

419
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:14,899
which product types are they getting so

420
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:16,789
if your doctors are they getting a

421
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,799
standardized medical product are they

422
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:20,719
getting it via a prescription are they

423
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,409
just getting something in the adult use

424
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,509
markets

425
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:24,980
what are those label specifications and

426
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:27,889
how tightly controlled might those

427
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,990
compositions be we know this medicine is

428
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:31,730
very effective for many we know it's

429
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,039
relatively safe it's got a broad-based

430
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,570
safety profile what else goes along with

431
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,259
it comes from better testing to make

432
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,059
sure it's pure

433
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:39,889
is proper and I think we can really

434
00:15:38,058 --> 00:15:41,749
deliver a lot of interesting medicine

435
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:45,229
medicines from just the cannabis

436
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:46,699
products itself and I want my goal and I

437
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:48,619
think everyone's goal should be what is

438
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:50,778
the minimum effective dose put the Med

439
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:51,979
back in medicine we're not trying to

440
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:54,918
overdo it here at all

441
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:56,839
so it's exceptionally complex I like the

442
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:58,759
potential energy surface here thinking

443
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,619
about where exactly might each patient

444
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,229
lie how do I find the right little

445
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:05,209
square for each individual patient and

446
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:06,859
how do I get them to find that as

447
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,928
quickly as possible how do I not get

448
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:10,639
stuck on the top of the hill or in some

449
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:12,738
place that's kind of effective how do I

450
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,808
find the most effective means of getting

451
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:16,788
them there as quickly as possible when

452
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,618
we define compositions in a broad-based

453
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:20,149
fashion we can pick either ends of the

454
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:22,489
spectrum and kind of start funneling

455
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:24,409
them down to their desired medicines it

456
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:26,119
should be a relatively short period of

457
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:27,828
trial and error that they actually get

458
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,569
there but the honest conversation is

459
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:31,278
there's going to be an iterative process

460
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:33,738
with you patient to finding the right

461
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,389
medicine in form for you it's not that

462
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:37,038
this indica is going to deliver this and

463
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:38,720
this sativa is going to deliver that so

464
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,399
pick one of those I think we have to

465
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,470
move away from that conversation and

466
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,600
really advance our methodologies and

467
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,600
language so that we can explain which

468
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,879
going to be right for them and I think

469
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,579
what's coming in the near future is the

470
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,980
rise of the next cannabinoids novel

471
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:57,078
cannabinoids and things such as the one

472
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,928
that I've highlighted here Delta 8 THC

473
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:02,748
we have manufacturing methodologies to

474
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:05,628
create high purity Delta 8 THC we also

475
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:07,959
see other versions of Delta 8 THC on the

476
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:10,609
marketplace and we're seeing them with

477
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,558
significant impurity profiles so there's

478
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:15,648
an overlay of the chromatograms on there

479
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:18,168
you see large unknowns in addition to

480
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:20,509
some Delta 8 so again what's the purity

481
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:22,429
how am i introducing that and how Mada

482
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:23,628
utilize that in a medical fashion I

483
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:25,009
think we're going to start to see more

484
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:27,588
and more cannabinoids as more

485
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:29,750
methodologies or developed and our goal

486
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,788
is to license these technologies to

487
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,079
medical purveyors brand builders and

488
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:35,058
groups that would like to take them into

489
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,798
the clinic so that we can standardize

490
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:40,269
this medicine in the most effective way

491
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,269
for patients thank you
