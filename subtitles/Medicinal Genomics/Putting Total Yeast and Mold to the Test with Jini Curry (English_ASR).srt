analyzing cannabis to ensure harmful

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,640
toxins are not present

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,318

laboratory operations for modern canna

62
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,839
ginny is also active in other areas of

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,680
the cannabis industry

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,159
she currently serves on the scientific

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,640
advisory board for analytical cannabis

66

testing task force with aoac

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,959
international

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
ginny and her team recently performed a

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,280
study that compared various methods of

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,039
total yeast and mold testing

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,878
their results showed that there is very

73
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,479
little agreement between the methods

74
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,598
calling into question whether total

75
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,518
yeast and mold is even a useful test

76
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,679
in the episode we discuss

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,719
why states require total yeast and mold

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,560
testing

79
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,959
the different types of testing methods

80
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,959
and how widely the results vary

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,959
how labs may not be giving yeast and

82
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,878
mold enough time to grow

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,280
whether the variance in total yeast and

84
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,399
mold testing results leads to lab

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,560
shopping

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,560
and should total yeast and mold even be

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,640
a required test

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,640
before we get to my conversation with

89
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,158

[Music]

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,199
good morning jenny thanks for joining us

120
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,360
on the podcast

121
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,919
hi yes

122
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,400
all right so i read your article in

123
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,478
analytical cannabis about the benefits

124
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,959
and pitfalls of total yeast in mold

125
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,560
counts in cannabis labs and i'll put a

126
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,079
link to that in the show description so

127
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
people can check that out

128
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,359
um and first i want to thank you for

129
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
writing it because

130
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,560
our team at medicinal genomics we've

131
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,038
been talking about issues with total

132
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,959
eastern mold for years now and you know

133
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,038
we've published papers on it we've done

134
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,399
webinars about it we've done canned med

135
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,879
talks about it

136
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,719
but since we're a kit manufacturer our

137
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,399
message is sort of met with some

138
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,199
skepticism because obviously we have a

139
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,959
dog in in the fight but for an

140
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,400
independent lab like modern canada to

141
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,959
raise some concerns that's something

142
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,638
that we think should resonate um but

143
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,959
before we get into the

144
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
investigation that your team did

145
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,319
maybe it's best to set the table for any

146
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,879
listeners who aren't well-versed in

147
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,560
cannabis testing so can you explain what

148
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,279
the total easton mold testing

149
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,800
requirements are in florida

150
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,638
at least to start

151
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,840
yeah of course so in the state of

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,240
florida

153
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,198
the testing requirements involve testing

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,639
final product in its final packaging so

155
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,720
flour is kind of what we're going to

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,439
focus on today it's where the problems

157
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,680
of total yeast and mold are seen and so

158
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,000
with that the limit is a hundred

159
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,240
thousand cfus per gram in the state of

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,959
florida what's interesting is you know

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,120
you have states that have no total yeast

162
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,758
and mold requirements to states that

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,399
have a hundred cfu per gram yeast and

164
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:32,000
mold requirements so it's a pretty vast

165
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,399
range across the us and so because of

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,319
that it causes some issues as well on

167
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,198
that front with data and with

168
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,039
methodology because if the methodology

169
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,038
doesn't allow you to be able to meet

170
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,839
those requirements labs are not going to

171
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,879
be able to produce accurate data

172
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,119
so

173
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,120
so with that total yeast and mold um

174
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,240
basically we're looking at you know how

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,319
much mold and yeast are in that flower

176
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,400
um it's not looking at any sort of

177
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,000
species it's not looking at like

178
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:04,000
specifics it's just an overall kind of

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
big picture of what's going on in that

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,360
cannabis flower

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,959
yeah and that's that's an important

182
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,319
distinction to make because you know you

183
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,918
mentioned that some states they don't

184
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,240
have total eastern mold testing

185
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,879
requirements but they do have species

186
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
specific tests for things that we know

187
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,279
are pathogenic like for example

188
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,959
aspergillus um does

189
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,719
does florida actually test for

190
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,879
aspergillus as well

191
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,000
yes so we require aspergillus all four

192
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,319
species

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,879
to be tested and then as well as that

194
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,800
it's salmonella and sugar toxin e coli

195
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,800
and flour samples

196
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,478
excellent excellent so i guess that's a

197
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
good question then so if you're already

198
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,918
kind of testing for the known pathogenic

199
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,520
species you know what is the benefit of

200
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,758
a total yeast and mold test from a

201
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,918
consumer perspective

202
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,680
i think really it and that's kind of

203
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,478
where i think the misconceptions may

204
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,400
arise from is that consumers have been

205
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,240
kind of it's been portrayed to them that

206
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,560
okay it's telling me you know is my

207
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,400
flower moldy but the problem with that

208
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
is there's good yeasts and there's good

209
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,239
molds and so looking at a total count

210
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,919
you're sometimes going to skew those

211
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,000
results and you're going to make a

212
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,240
patient believe they're not safe when

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,839
really they are or a consumer depending

214
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,240
on if you're in a recreational or

215
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,839
medicinal market

216
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,759
yeah and i mean and that's a good

217
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,439
example with aspergillus too right if

218
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,560
you were only testing for total yeast

219
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,439
and mold

220
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,759
um

221
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,399
and you had a threshold set to say a

222
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,158
hundred thousand cfus you could have 99

223
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,120
000 cfus of aspergillus in your product

224
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,038
and

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
that's that's not good for anyone

226
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,319
correct yeah and that's one of the

227
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,759
things that we mentioned i mentioned in

228
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,399
the article is like looking at those

229
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,799
pathogenic species because if you don't

230
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,278
then a product may seem safe when it

231
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,079
actually truly isn't safe

232
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,000
right absolutely okay so now

233
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,000
now that we've established that so what

234
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,399
prompted you and the team at modern

235
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,240
canada to investigate total yeast and

236
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,839
mold like what what questions were you

237
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,440
looking to answer

238
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,120
so um basically we similar to medicinal

239
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,680
genomics have had lots of questions

240
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,600
about yeast and mold over the years

241
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,359
as the first testing lab in the state of

242
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,680
florida we originally started with

243
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,080
plating total yeast in mold

244
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,639
using like the compact dry plates and

245
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,959
then moved into pcr testing and we did

246
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,360
pcr testing and then

247
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,119
after certification we certified through

248
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,278
pcr for total yeast and mold we're

249
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
running samples um and we actually had a

250
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,200
client come back and say they tested

251
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,920
with another lab and got much higher

252
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,040
counts than what we got with pcr and

253
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:40,479
they used plating and so after that that

254
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,159
really triggered me to start diving in

255
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,000
at the end of the day the science is the

256
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,600
most important part of it and so

257
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,679
figuring out that science and figuring

258
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,560
out is their issues and how can we adapt

259
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,479
for those issues was really my goal of

260
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,879
doing this investigation

261
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,440
medicinal genomics has been wonderful

262
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,039
with helping do r d and really talking

263
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,560
us through some of the troubleshooting

264
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,439
we've seen

265
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,000
we

266
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,079
started by you know doing some dilutions

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,159
in pcr and kind of trying to determine

268
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,799
if there was some suppression happening

269
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,639
and we did see that there was in cases

270
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,639
where if there's a ton of yeast and mold

271
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,319
in sample there can be suppression on

272
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,639
the pcr and so

273
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,200
we started adapting the medicinal

274
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,559
genomics method to up front do a 20x

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,800
dilution so instead of doing 1 to 10

276
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,679
grams like the protocol calls for we

277
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,399
move to doing one gram of flour to 20

278
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,399
mils of tsb in order to really prevent

279
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,720
that suppression from happening and we

280
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,799
really saw a big difference in the

281
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,040
reproducibility once we started doing

282
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,639
that because we were no longer fighting

283
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,319
okay is there too much yeast and mold in

284
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,838
that sample right

285
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
yeah because in those cases what you

286
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,120
would sort of be doing a a re-run and

287
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,278
with a with a dilution to sort of make

288
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,799
sure that you aren't overloading

289
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,399
yeah and so that's that's ultimately

290
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,919
what we ended up doing is you know i

291
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,720
kind of talked to the team at medicinal

292
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:03,759
genomics about as far as the cq values

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,079
on qpcr what i should be seeing changes

294
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,679
if i do dilutions and so we started

295
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,599
applying those dilutions so we took a

296
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,439
sample and we did a 2x dilution and then

297
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,159
we did a 5x dilution and then we did a

298
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,480
10x dilution and we watched how those cq

299
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,078
values should change so we know that

300
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,839
they should change in a very particular

301
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:25,599
way and shift you know downfield to be a

302
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,600
higher cq value lower reported value but

303
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
we weren't always seeing that if we just

304
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,440
did the one to ten

305
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,680
okay all right and before we leave too

306
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,600
many people in the dust here because you

307
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,199
know this audience i mean i know anyone

308
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,560
who's familiar with medicinal genomics

309
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
they're gonna understand this but you

310
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,159
know this is a canmed podcast we have

311
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,799
some people that are more on the medical

312
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,439
side or are more on the cultivation side

313
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,120
so i was hoping maybe you could briefly

314
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,440
explain the difference between like

315
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,480
plating and culture based methods and

316
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,800
pcr

317
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,079
yeah of course so with plating basically

318
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,199
what you're doing is you're taking your

319
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,958
sample

320
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
and you're diluting it in some sort of a

321
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,078
media

322
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,958
and then you're taking that media and

323
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:07,039
you're adding that to a plate whether

324
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,958
that be an agar whether that be a petri

325
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,679
film plate whether that be a compact dry

326
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,278
plate whatever type of culture method

327
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,199
you're using you're going to add that

328
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,958
diluted sample to that

329
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
and there's particular amounts that you

330
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,838
add you know for the

331
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,000
agar plates you're using only 0.1 mil

332
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920
but for you know petri film you're using

333
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
a full mill so you have to factor

334
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,039
dilutions into that as well because that

335
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,679
changes your result um how much you play

336
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,919
is going to have a significant impact on

337
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,879
what you're going to see your outcome be

338
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,240
so

339
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,240
versus pcr which you know is the process

340
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
of taking the sample and you're

341
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,079
extracting the dna from that sample and

342
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,079
so what you're doing is you're isolating

343
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,799
not only the cannabis dna but you're

344
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:54,319
also isolating the microbe dna and then

345
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,000
using a primer you basically take your

346
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,839
dna that you've obtained and you mix it

347
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,320
with a primer and then you load it onto

348
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,399
the pcr and it undergoes a process of

349
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,040
heating and cooling in order to anneal

350
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,039
that dna and when those microbes are

351
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,879
present they bind to that primer and

352
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,319
they anneal and then you'll fluoresce

353
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,360
have fluorescence and you'll see what

354
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,360
that is

355
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,800
the great thing about qpcr is you have

356
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,039
an internal control which is hex and so

357
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,879
that hex fluorescence lets you know that

358
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,639
you have cannabis dna and that your

359
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,919
extraction worked

360
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,159
that's a pro to pcr versus plating with

361
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,159
p with plating you have no way of

362
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,319
knowing if it was plated correctly and

363
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,399
if you're actually getting solution on

364
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,399
the plate whereas with pcr

365
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,559
if you don't get that hex you know your

366
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,240
extraction didn't work so you can't say

367
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,479
for sure if that sample really has

368
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
easter mold or not

369
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,920
excellent that was an excellent

370
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,120
excellent description um we're not going

371
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,879
to use that um so

372
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,000
in your investigation if i read it

373
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,879
correctly

374
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,278
you're primarily comparing plating

375
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,360
methods to one another correct

376
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,838
correct and we did you know compare kind

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,278
of the pcr as well we ran pcr on those

378
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,639
samples

379
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,720
but mostly it was for us to do plating

380
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,198
the state of florida is potentially

381
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,440
considering moving away from qpcr for

382
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,759
total yeast and mold and so if that

383
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
happens we wanted to be prepared since

384
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,120
originally we were only certified for

385
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,399
qpcr and total yeast and mold okay and

386
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,480
so

387
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,679
there's a number of different plating

388
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,440
methods for total yeast and mold and it

389
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,120
looks like based on your results that

390
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,800
they are all

391
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,480
they don't necessarily agree with one

392
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,879
another so like what are some of the

393
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,879
differences here i mean because i mean

394
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,198
correct me if i'm wrong but in order for

395
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,320
a plate to work i mean

396
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,799
you're

397
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,800
you're putting the microbes into a

398
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,719
solution that's supposed to be optimized

399
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,039
for growth for a certain

400
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,800
type of microbe so in this case a total

401
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:58,799
yeast and mold but as i understand it

402
00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:00,719
it's very difficult to actually capture

403
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,039
all of the yeast and mold that could

404
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,839
potentially be there and

405
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,319
effectively exclude any of the bacteria

406
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,160
or other organisms that could be there

407
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,480
correct and so that's really the big

408
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,480
battle with plating is you know ensuring

409
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,159
that you're not getting bacterial growth

410
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,720
and that you are getting only yeast and

411
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,480
mold growth but you also are combating

412
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,199
the fact that aspergillus doesn't grow

413
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,800
well on plating so for that if you're

414
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,799
plating and you have aspergillus you're

415
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,519
still going to get lower counts than

416
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,519
what is representative of the sample

417
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,679
because you're not able to grow those

418
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,440
they don't culture well they don't

419
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,519
survive in that type of environment

420
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,000
which is why qpcr is so important for

421
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,000
some of the speciation testing because

422
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
that's the only way you're going to be

423
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,198
able to accurately identify those

424
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,720
compounds

425
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,559
excellent okay so let's get into your

426
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,160
results here so please talk about the

427
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,239
number of different

428
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,879
methods that you that you did and sort

429
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,399
of what your process was and ultimately

430
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,039
what you guys found

431
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,679
so what we did was we started with seven

432
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,679
different types of plates or agars

433
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,958
and used all seven of those and ran the

434
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,039
same sample

435
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,119
so we took a sample and we actually ran

436
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,198
the sample in triplicate and then we ran

437
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,078
it at three different dilutions for each

438
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,719
plate

439
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,198
it was a big study my microbiologists

440
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,040
were phenomenal they were troopers

441
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,359
through the entire study

442
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,078
and it was a lot of plates to manage and

443
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,800
to count and to keep track of so we did

444
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,879
looked at compact dry we looked at petri

445
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,599
film rapid yeast and mold petri film

446
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,958
non-rapid yeast in mold potato dextrose

447
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,399
agar potato dextrose agar with chlora

448
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,278
tetracycline

449
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,720
um

450
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,399
dichlorine rose bengal chlorophyll

451
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,480
lobe

452
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,480
and abdex i'm not even gonna attempt

453
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,240
that one so those are more kind of

454
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,680
formerly known as pda pdac drbc and

455
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,159
sabdex

456
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,239
right um and so we took all of those

457
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,078
plates we plated them we looked at okay

458
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,680
what type of dilution needs to be done

459
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:05,198
on the plates um those agars so the pda

460
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:07,759
pdac drbc and sabdex all needed to be

461
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,160
plated at 0.1 mils versus the compact

462
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,160
dry rapid yeast and mold and non-rapid

463
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,558
yeast and mold petri films needed to be

464
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
plated at a mill so we mapped out what

465
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,798
our dilutions needed to be in order to

466
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,240
obtain the same dilution on each plate

467
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,519
and then went about making those

468
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,599
dilutions

469
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,279
all of the dilutions were made for all

470
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,759
of them at the same time and they were

471
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,720
all taken from the same source and so

472
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,279
that ensured that the homogeneity wasn't

473
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
going to be in question because one of

474
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,759
the fights you're combating with

475
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,558
cannabis is it's not homogeneous and the

476
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,119
yeast in bold is not going to be spread

477
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,918
evenly throughout the product um you may

478
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,519
get one scoop that you know has tons of

479
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,480
yeast and mold and you may get another

480
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,960
scoop that doesn't and so in order to

481
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,120
standardize that and ensure that we were

482
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,200
getting a good true result we only use

483
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,319
the sample once and then we did it for

484
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,798
everything same for pcr we also ran pcr

485
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,200
on these um what we found from the

486
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,200
plating was it was a little shocking um

487
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,679
to kind of see how vastly different some

488
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,319
of the results were and then also how

489
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,720
different the incubation times were so

490
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,200
for example rapid easton mold on petri

491
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,160
film they recommend you know 48 hours

492
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,558
but between the 48 hour and the 72 hour

493
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,558
mark we saw the yeast and mold on those

494
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,519
plates almost double

495
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,759
um so if you have a lab that's you know

496
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,160
going by the manufacturer recommendation

497
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,000
and only incubating for 48 hours they

498
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,320
could be severely under quantifying

499
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,558
yeast and mold um in those samples and

500
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,240
so because of that we established true

501
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,639
incubation times for each of the

502
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,440
different plates we're utilizing um so

503
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,679
that we knew kind of looking at it how

504
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,679
long did it need to incubate and we did

505
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,320
that by we started viewing the plates at

506
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,640
48 hours and we viewed the plates at 48

507
00:18:54,319 --> 00:19:00,720
hours 72 hours 96 hours and 120 hours

508
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,919
and we've looked at the change and so

509
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,000
the true incubation time was defined as

510
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,400
the point in time where no new colonies

511
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,119
appeared and instead the colonies just

512
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,440
grew in size and so we were able to map

513
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,199
that out and really determine okay when

514
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
do you need to incubate this too to

515
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,960
really let all of the yeast and mold

516
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,000
grow

517
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,440
interesting

518
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,919
and so

519
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,600
the ultimate result that you got like

520
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,400
when you're comparing to

521
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,439
um other methods did they all arrive at

522
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,120
the same

523
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,038
you know number or was it sort of all

524
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,599
across the board it was all across the

525
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,599
board um and the other thing is even in

526
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,319
plating we saw a lot of suppression

527
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,079
occurring so your lower dilutions you

528
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,079
know the standard protocol in plating is

529
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,240
to play it at three dilutions so you

530
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,359
know you played at a 100 x you played it

531
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,000
a 1000 x and you played it a 10 000 x um

532
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,079
but what we saw was if you took the

533
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,798
average of those three results which is

534
00:19:54,079 --> 00:20:00,399
kind of the standard for this type of

535
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:02,480
methodology that 100x was experiencing

536
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,200
suppression and therefore driving the

537
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,400
overall result down thus skewing those

538
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,038
results low

539
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,480
so when in fact a product may

540
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:14,798
of failed had you factored in the 1000x

541
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,519
and the 10000x when you factored in that

542
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,279
1000x it drove the average down enough

543
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,639
that the product passed

544
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,158
interesting

545
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,080
no and that's interesting when you were

546
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,880
talking about sampling and there was a

547
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,879
really good point

548
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,879
what about sub sampling from that

549
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:36,000
because you're talking about taking like

550
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,000
a smaller volume out of that original um

551
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,000
sample prep right and putting that onto

552
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,759
the plate so i mean you could

553
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,839
potentially be missing other microbes

554
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,000
that don't get plated correct

555
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,959
right and the other thing being is that

556
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,279
you know

557
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,000
if you aren't able to ensure it mixed

558
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,639
well how do you know that you got a good

559
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,440
amount of you know

560
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,640
whatever those microbes are versus just

561
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,798
your media so versus just your tsb for

562
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,038
example how do you know you mixed it

563
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,240
well and that's where you know i think

564
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,720
pcr

565
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,798
has the benefit over plating is because

566
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,558
you are able to ensure

567
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,200
the process worked and with plating

568
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,279
there is no internal control

569
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,960
right and the other thing too as you

570
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,119
pointed out in your results here is that

571
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,079
you know plating it really relies on

572
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:26,798
this growth right where you know

573
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,399
depending on how long you let it go um

574
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,279
you're going to get a different number

575
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,759
whereas with pcr it is

576
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,158
i mean it is a snapshot of what is in

577
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:39,759
there at this moment like if you i mean

578
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,000
if you kept the isolated dna for another

579
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,798
you know week or so you wouldn't see as

580
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,720
drastic a a difference in results right

581
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,400
right and so that's that's kind of the

582
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,600
battle um

583
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,400
of plating versus pcr and you know the

584
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,158
other

585
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,480
comments that people will sometimes make

586
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,120
is well pcr doesn't tell you if the dna

587
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,038
is dead or alive so by running pcr

588
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,119
you're getting everything that's present

589
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,440
you're not just getting the things that

590
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,439
are alive and harmful but

591
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,200
the you know caveat to that in the

592
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,480
conversation that needs to be had

593
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,640
regarding that is that if that dna is

594
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,798
present that indicates it was alive at

595
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,600
some point and so if you have aspergilis

596
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:22,158
for example that you know is now dead

597
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:25,119
but was once alive it could have created

598
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,280
mycotoxins and then now you have a whole

599
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,918
nother contaminant you're fighting um

600
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,359
and so that's that's a place too where i

601
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,080
think that there needs to be more

602
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:36,798
education regarding the microbes and how

603
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,639
microbes work um because i don't i don't

604
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,639
think that people always realize that

605
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,840
that like dead versus alive shouldn't

606
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,759
matter because if it was there it could

607
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,599
have caused other problems

608
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,679
yeah that's a great point and the other

609
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,639
thing too that that we run into all the

610
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,120
time is is comparing qpcr results to

611
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,320
plating results and you know how come

612
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,558
they don't match up in certain

613
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,678
situations but it sounds like i mean

614
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,519
looking at your results plating doesn't

615
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,200
even agree with plating

616
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,440
right and that's kind of where i think

617
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,558
the more research needs to be done is

618
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,360
you know i think everybody kind of dove

619
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,558
into cannabis testing head first

620
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,199
and i don't

621
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:20,319
necessarily know if the knowledge in the

622
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,798
research um was deep enough for a head

623
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:25,200
first jump um the waters may have been a

624
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,798
little too shallow and so that may be

625
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,440
causing a lot of these problems and

626
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,119
that's why you know my study the purpose

627
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,038
of this was to get people talking about

628
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,719
total yeast and mold more let's get

629
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,480
people having these conversations let's

630
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,120
get people doing more research let's see

631
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,919
if we can involve universities who have

632
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,918
the time and the money and the you know

633
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,080
amount of lab techs that are needed to

634
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,240
do these types of studies so we can

635
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,599
really figure out if total yeast and

636
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,000
mold is going to continue being a

637
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,558
requirement in cannabis what is the best

638
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,240
method and how do we know that's the

639
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,599
best method

640
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,440
yeah right because there needs to be

641
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,038
some sort of

642
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,798
some sort of truth here right we're

643
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:03,519
getting a whole lot of different answers

644
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:05,679
and

645
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,200
um yeah we need we need to figure out

646
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,440
which ones which one's correct and

647
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,360
calibrate to that

648
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,440
right and and that's really where those

649
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,038
questions arose during our investigation

650
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,360
you know we found a standard reference

651
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,960
material from an iso accredited provider

652
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,959
and when looking at that reference

653
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,360
material we noticed that it had two

654
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,558
drastically different results the values

655
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:31,119
were 152 000 cf per gram compared to

656
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:33,839
423 000 cfu per gram and you know those

657
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,839
are concerningly different numbers and

658
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,918
as we did more reading we noticed there

659
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,240
was a footer and that footer said that

660
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,679
one was plated with petri film and the

661
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,278
other was plated with sabdex agar and so

662
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,200
the question is you know you're looking

663
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:48,720
at a result that's three times higher

664
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,319
than the other

665
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,200
which which is correct and so you notice

666
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:58,079
that labs i think most labs probably go

667
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,759
about using the petri film um rapid

668
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,158
yeast and mold plates they're really

669
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,038
easy to work with they're quick

670
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,559
they

671
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,519
tell you you only need to incubate for

672
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,519
48 hours and so for labs who are trying

673
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,000
to meet these quick turnaround times

674
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,879
that's going to be what they're using

675
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,359
but if that is in fact leading to a

676
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,679
result that's three times lower than

677
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,000
another culture-based media

678
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,759
is that really a valid method

679
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,359
right no and that brandon brings up

680
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,359
another point too is that if you have

681
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,519
different labs doing different methods

682
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,000
and one's using a method that's giving

683
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,480
lower results then we we get into this

684
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,319
issue of lab shopping correct

685
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,159
correct and so people

686
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,399
people you know it puts labs in an

687
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,919
uncomfortable position because clients

688
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,440
come and they're like well this lab

689
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,520
obtained this result why aren't you

690
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,720
obtaining this result and then like well

691
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,720
we're going to take our business

692
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,278
somewhere where we can get a lower

693
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,079
result and i think that that's why

694
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,919
standards in general are so important um

695
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,480
but especially with things where we're

696
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,038
seeing such vastly different results you

697
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,720
know with analytical chemistry you know

698
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,480
chemistry is one thing it's like there's

699
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,000
a known amount of that thing and

700
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,200
everybody should be able to obtain the

701
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,759
same number but microbes and

702
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,840
microbiology is so vastly different um

703
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,679
it depends on you know how they

704
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,519
incubated it did it get incubated at the

705
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,200
right temperature did it you know get

706
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,599
checked on at the right time did the

707
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,440
dilution get done correctly there's so

708
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,558
many different factors that can change

709
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,120
the result

710
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:30,000
and from seeing this it seems like

711
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,519
all kind of standard reference materials

712
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,839
that are created

713
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:37,119
for micro seem to just kind of be

714
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:39,759
consensus basis so it's run multiple

715
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,399
times by multiple different people and

716
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:45,119
whatever the average they obtain is is

717
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,960
that you know certified value and so

718
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,558
because of that you run into issues

719
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,480
because if they're using different

720
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,839
methods they're getting very different

721
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,240
results

722
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,798
interesting interesting

723
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,000
um so we talked a little bit about how

724
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:01,599
how qpcr performed and how it how it

725
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,200
compared to some of the plating results

726
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,038
but i'm curious too

727
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,798
so you talked about how

728
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,480
you know even some methods when you did

729
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,960
different dilutions or you did it in

730
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,798
triplicate that those results didn't um

731
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,038
didn't really line up how consistent was

732
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,359
the qpcr results when you did that

733
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:20,000
though because it's not having to deal

734
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,199
with the the issue of growth and things

735
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
like that

736
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,200
yeah we and you know

737
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,558
this is one of the other struggles we

738
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,319
kind of faced and we worked with

739
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,158
medicinal genomics quite a bit on this

740
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,639
is we were having some lack of

741
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,120
reproducibility there as well um with

742
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,600
dilutions and that's really what led us

743
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:40,239
to that bigger dilution up front is

744
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,158
because of those issues um and then when

745
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,159
you're looking at a log scale you have

746
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,120
to realize that when you're performing

747
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:51,440
that conversion calculation from

748
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:54,319
qc or cq value to cfu per gram you it is

749
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,558
a logarithmic kind of formula so that

750
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,798
result the larger dilution you do is

751
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,960
going to start to over quantify and so

752
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:04,000
that's really the big thing we saw is if

753
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,360
you do too big of a dilution in qpcr

754
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,119
you're going to over quantify

755
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,678
drastically because you're still going

756
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,278
to get that dna but it's not the

757
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,720
logarithmic scale is not going to be

758
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,558
able to account for how large of a

759
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,038
dilution you did

760
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,639
got it yeah and it's a great point you

761
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,879
talked about that that one to 20

762
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,120
dilution and we did just recently

763
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,000
publish an updated protocol for tym

764
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:29,038
using that very same uh dilution so

765
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,359
thank you for your help on that

766
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,278
um all right so i guess kind of wrapping

767
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,678
up here i'm curious what was sort of the

768
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,679
most surprising thing you learned during

769
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,080
this whole exercise

770
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,320
um i would say that we're not a hundred

771
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,158
percent sure that really

772
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,079
yeast and mold is figured out anywhere

773
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,640
in cannabis um so

774
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:51,199
we're just not confident that you know

775
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,480
it is a good test for cannabis material

776
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,038
just because of the lack of

777
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,319
homogenization in cannabis because of

778
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,798
the complexity of cannabis you know and

779
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:04,079
is it really providing what consumers

780
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:05,759
need to know that they're safe um if

781
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,480
you're not looking at some of these

782
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:11,440
other microbes such as powdery mildew or

783
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,440
you know fusarium species or penicillium

784
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,360
species and those don't grow well on

785
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,558
plates or those aren't identified even

786
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,240
in qpcr you're running into are patients

787
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,480
truly safe with total yeast and mold

788
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,599
testing or do we need more pathogenic

789
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,480
testing

790
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:28,639
and after this study i am definitely

791
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,038
leaning on the side of you know we need

792
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,960
more pathogenic testing i think total

793
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,278
yeast and mold testing is a great

794
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,600
representation for you know the grower

795
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,240
or the producer of how clean their

796
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:43,519
process is but i don't think it's a good

797
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,240
indication of how safe the product is

798
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,000
yeah yeah that's no that's an important

799
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,399
distinction it's something we

800
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,119
i think we agree with you as well um you

801
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,278
know total yeast and mold it's sort of a

802
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,639
a big thing to take on there to to

803
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,079
really

804
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,399
put a stake in the ground and say this

805
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,639
is the total amount i mean that's that's

806
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,119
very difficult to do yes there's lots of

807
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,360
species there's lots of species of mold

808
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,278
and yeast and you you just you don't

809
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,119
know you can't determine if it's all

810
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,359
growing on the plates

811
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,359
we did some consultations with some

812
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,278
microbiologists

813
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,439
and one of them actually told us that in

814
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,679
culture even in culture-based media

815
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,240
you're only going to see about fourth of

816
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,000
what a sample truly has

817
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,839
and so that's kind of crazy to think

818
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,359
about as well because you're facing you

819
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,959
know viable versus culturable

820
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,798
yeah no and that's a good point too

821
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,480
because i think i did see in your

822
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,200
article that you mentioned testing

823
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,960
irradiated products um did you find

824
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
anything interesting there

825
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,200
yeah so with irradiated products we

826
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,519
almost always never see qpcr hits or if

827
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,000
they are they're very very low um with

828
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,158
plating we saw kind of the same thing

829
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
but there was some weird reaction that

830
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,720
was going on especially on the petri

831
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,960
film and it was changing the color of

832
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,798
the plate so the entire plate changed to

833
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,360
a color that would indicate a yeast in

834
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,960
mold so on petri film for example you're

835
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,678
looking at you know you're looking for

836
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,600
those blue colonies um and the whole

837
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,840
plate would turn blue and it's like okay

838
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,398
wait what's what's happening here what's

839
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,480
what's going on um is this

840
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:23,119
a full plate of colonies is it like

841
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,960
blown out or what's happening um so we

842
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,119
did lots of dilutions and we did see as

843
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,679
we diluted things out those plates

844
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,158
turned less blue so i do think that that

845
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,919
radiation may have played a factor into

846
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,960
some sort of reaction happening on those

847
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,159
plates

848
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,000
yeah that it created some sort of

849
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,840
some sort of chemical reaction that just

850
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,919
you know turned everything blue yeah

851
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,359
we're we're really not sure um i think

852
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,360
that's another thing that needs to be

853
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,599
further investigated you know there's

854
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,240
some research that indicates that

855
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,959
radiation just knocks down the cells

856
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,359
versus fully destroying them and so if

857
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,679
that's the case you know if you grow

858
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,519
these things for even longer than 120

859
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,399
hours are you eventually going to start

860
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,720
seeing growth on them is it is that the

861
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,239
case and so i again

862
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,640
total yeast and mold needs a lot more

863
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,278
research done before anyone makes any

864
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,519
conclusive decisions about it

865
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,278
excellent all right so

866
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,880
i think i think you already said this

867
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,640
but i'll give it i'll give you another

868
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,200
opportunity to say it so so based on the

869
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,519
results of your your um investigation

870
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,919
here what what would you recommend would

871
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,839
be the best course for testing to to

872
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,559
make sure that patients are safe from

873
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,959
any uh pathogenic yeast and mold

874
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,398
i think number one more research needs

875
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
to be done

876
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:38,959
more

877
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,919
people need to participate in studies

878
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,440
and we need to do investigations and pt

879
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,840
providers and reference material

880
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,840
providers we need to work together to

881
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,839
try to figure out how to get a good true

882
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,678
representative sample that could be

883
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,759
distributed and tested by multiple

884
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,559
different you know laboratories and by

885
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,398
multiple different methods to see what

886
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,839
kind of lines up where

887
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,918
and then also

888
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,519
i personally believe that maybe moving

889
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,159
away from total yeast and mold in

890
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,319
cannabis is is the right decision and

891
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,399
adding some additional species i know we

892
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,558
would be you know happy to test things

893
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,439
like powdery mildew and frucerium and

894
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:17,678
penicillium species

895
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,919
versus testing that total yeast and mold

896
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,759
because you know in cannabis powdery

897
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,919
mildew is something is very very very

898
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,240
very common and it's not something that

899
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,640
grows well and it's also something that

900
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,798
if you run a standard total yeast and

901
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,720
mold panel using qpcr you're not going

902
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:34,879
to identify either

903
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,798
right right and you know it's a good

904
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,480
point you make like is totally some mold

905
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:42,639
a good test for cannabis is it used in

906
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,360
other testing food testing things like

907
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,840
that

908
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,479
it is but surprisingly in food testing

909
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:52,158
um we kind of did some looking into usp

910
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,319
61 versus usp 62 i mean we did see that

911
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,960
in food testing it's more of along the

912
00:33:54,319 --> 00:34:00,319
lines of gauging how clean the process

913
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,759
was versus gauging if the process you

914
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:06,158
know is safe um in lettuce i can

915
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,000
guarantee you your lettuce probably has

916
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,320
a lot more total yeast and mold on it

917
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,760
than what you're seeing in your cannabis

918
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,000
because the testing that they're

919
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,240
performing is mostly for you know

920
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,878
salmonella sugar toxin e coli those

921
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,279
pathogenic species that are dangerous

922
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,960
versus those total yeast and mold you're

923
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,560
you're growing lettuce in the ground the

924
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,838
lettuce you grow on the ground is gonna

925
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,759
have some yeast and mold on it

926
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,519
especially if you're growing it in a

927
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,359
humid environment

928
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,960
right yeah and one of the

929
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,639
one of the examples we always bring up

930
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,878
too is that you know sometimes you get

931
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,639
strawberries from the grocery store and

932
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,039
a day later you open up the fridge and

933
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,760
they have fuzz all over them um

934
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,159
so

935
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,240
they're not completely clean either

936
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,398
correct yeah and i think it that also

937
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,678
comes down to education like you know

938
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,000
people

939
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,480
whether it's been you know legally or

940
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,719
not have been using cannabis for quite

941
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,838
some time and

942
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,319
years before testing was even a thing

943
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:04,719
even out in some states that testing

944
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,720
wasn't originally required the rules on

945
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,118
testing weren't developed until after a

946
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,319
program was started up and so in those

947
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,240
instances

948
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,320
things weren't being tested people were

949
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,399
you know using product without being

950
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,480
concerned but now that testing's

951
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,160
required people are more and more

952
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,480
concerned but i think ultimately you

953
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,199
know yeast and mold could even be visual

954
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,119
like

955
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,439
does the bud have

956
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,880
mold on it if it does

957
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,880
don't smoke it right

958
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,838
and i think that's that's also something

959
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,960
that where education needs to be added

960
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,960
is like

961
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,119
visually inspecting something and really

962
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,720
determining like you said if your

963
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,720
strawberries that you open from your

964
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,279
fridge have fuzz on them you're you're

965
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,199
not gonna eat them um so the same kind

966
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,280
of goes with your cannabis products

967
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,000
right a little common sense goes a long

968
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,760
way

969
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,920
all right so winding down here jenny i

970
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,040
did want to give you an opportunity um

971
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,838
before i let you go to plug any website

972
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,358
social media or any additional resources

973
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:05,358
that you think would be helpful for the

974
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:06,880
listeners to to learn more about what we

975
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:08,319
talked about today

976
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,640
yeah i think you know analytical

977
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,640
cannabis is a great resource uh they're

978
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:15,679
a provider who does a lot of

979
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:18,400
publications on cannabis testing as well

980
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,480
as our website moderncanna.com

981
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,039
we've got lots of information as well

982
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,400
kind of on different blogs on testing

983
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,159
and things like that

984
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,000
and to also be on the lookout for more

985
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,279
presentations from our lab um we're

986
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,039
doing a lot more research and

987
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,320
development now um and we're going to be

988
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:37,679
participating in a lot more uh kind of

989
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,599
presentations and conferences that are

990
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,838
mostly focused on standardization in

991
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,680
general so not just yeast and mold but

992
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:44,880
across the industry

993
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,480
all right excellent we'll be on the

994
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,480
lookout for that we'll have to have you

995
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,440
back on uh to talk about something else

996
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,519
and hopefully we'll see you out at

997
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,200
canmed as well

998
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:56,320
