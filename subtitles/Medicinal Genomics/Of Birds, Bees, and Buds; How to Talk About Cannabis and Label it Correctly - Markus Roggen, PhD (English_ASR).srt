1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,918
good morning uh third day I'm tired

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,599
um

3
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:12,599
first time for me in Florida

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,719
it's hot it's flat

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,460
but I came prepared I read up on the

6
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,858
Florida man

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,900
so that was my guiding impression for

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,840
this uh visit

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,059
but today

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,980
as the talk might indicate maybe we talk

11
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,198
about sex education

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,780
but I only have 20 minutes so I probably

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,039
get it through before DeSantis signs the

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,039
law Banning this topic

15
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,600
um

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,700
actually no we're talking math

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,200
um so the first question I have to you

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,059
and you can write down the answer

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,140
yourself and then at the end I tell you

20
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:51,538
you're wrong

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,480
uh in one of the later slides okay so

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:59,219
Mary Jane goes to a store and buys an

23
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:03,119
eighth of lemon OG The Strain has 23.3

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,159
total THC she rolls a half gram joined

25
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:09,118
she takes three puffs

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,380
so how much THC has she inhaled

27
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,659
anyone

28
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,519
I mean like all the other talks over the

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,140
last few days was all about consumption

30
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,938
of cannabis

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,239
and how much you should take there was a

32
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,379
low-dose talk like can anyone answer

33
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,859
your

34
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:28,319
no you're wrong and I and I actually

35
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,719
show you the data at the end

36
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,519
okay okay this is a hard one so let's go

37
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,819
for an easier one

38
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,519
um so if you want to buy Bubba Kush with

39
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:43,199
20.2 THC for 4.420

40
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:44,759
uh or lemon OG was 23 uh for 710 and yes

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,560
these prices are made up because the

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,239
numbers are funny

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,040
um which one gives you more bang for

44
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,798
your buck

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,259
because right now that is what a

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,600
cannabis consumer buys for and and the

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,700
ma the industry is trying to sell to the

48
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,839
consumer it's all about the total THC

49
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,040
number

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,618
okay so

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,500
um the less potent THC is actually the

52
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,000
better for the bank of the buck so

53
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,080
actually they shouldn't have bought the

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,939
higher one they should have bought the

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,219
lower one if they just wanted more THC

56
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,560
for the same amount of dollars

57
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,959
so this is weird right

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,360
um I find this

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,459
curious why the industry is doing this

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,500
and so the whole talk will be about why

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,439
are you doing this why this is wrong and

62
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,239
how can we do it better it's an idea so

63
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,818
here's a summary of what we're going to

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,480
talk about

65
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,238
I will

66
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,500
tell you how cannabis support today why

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,780
it's wrong

68
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,818
how could we do this better and I will

69
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,919
fight you for it like the Florida men

70
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,659
who got convicted for a sword with a

71
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,299
deadly rifle by throwing an alligator

72
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,340
through a drive-through window

73
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,019
but actually that's not efficient and

74
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,360
I'm all about efficiency so I wouldn't

75
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,400
use the alligator I'm German I'm kind of

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,580
a stereotype I have a PhD in chemistry

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,140
I'm German and I'm all about efficiency

78
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,959
and so my lab does all process

79
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:08,000
optimization analytical development and

80
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,000
all the other fun stuff of chemistry

81
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,620
um but I don't do this alone we do this

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,378
in collaboration with other research

83
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,658
institutions and researchers

84
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:22,500
um Verdian science

85
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:25,079
presented yesterday Mike Tagan and I'm a

86
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,500
good friend with his colleague Linda

87
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,680
clumpas but also at this slide I just

88
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,780
noticed that all the speakers from the

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,700
US they have private companies that

90
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,739
presented their work and then all the

91
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,738
Canadian speakers so I'm German but I

92
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,959
live in Canada my lab is there they all

93
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,539
are from universities the university did

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,120
this research and so on so same here we

95
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,219
work with UBC

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,599
um because that is federally legal we

97
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,699
have the licenses and we're allowed to

98
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,199
do this work

99
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,598
okay

100
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:01,199
um luckily for you I'm actually not

101
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:03,780
going through all the hard experiments

102
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,759
that we've been doing so we can skip all

103
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,239
the queue metrics and the kinetic

104
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:13,318
studies uh and it's more of a

105
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,900
theoretical or conceptual talk also um

106
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,759
as I see a picture a camera back there

107
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,739
you don't actually have to take pictures

108
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,478
of this this is being filmed I upload

109
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,120
this to SlideShare it will be on my

110
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,399
website at some point and the last slide

111
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,139
has all the references so take a picture

112
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,120
of the last slide

113
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,800
um oh yeah and in Canada we are licensed

114
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,540
to do mushroom and psychedelic research

115
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,379
so I have those compounds in my safe as

116
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,120
well

117
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,500
but for another day

118
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,379
so

119
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,720
how do we buy cannabis today

120
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,379
if you go in a store

121
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:51,300
it's it's all about the total THC number

122
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:52,978
how much THC by weight percentage is in

123
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,139
the flower in the joint in The Vape

124
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:58,258
cartridge and that seems to be the

125
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,780
number that everyone wants and everyone

126
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,780
seems to be complaining about it

127
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:05,039
because the producer needs to get the

128
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,918
higher number

129
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,620
but the testing lab is not giving it so

130
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,599
the producer tries other things or the

131
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,000
testing lab will artificially inflate

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,080
these numbers just to get their the

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,079
business

134
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,959
and there have been enough articles uh

135
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,300
in the recent memory that showed that

136
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,739
the labor claim is incorrect that

137
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,240
Laboratories are cheating and getting

138
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,680
caught for it that producers are

139
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,478
cheating and getting caught for it and

140
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,560
all that just because you need this High

141
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,418
number

142
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,478
but does this number actually make any

143
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:38,099
sense or do we even need this because if

144
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,879
we think of other Industries do they do

145
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,800
that

146
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,740
so in Pharma

147
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,020
do they sell by weight

148
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,759
not really so actually turns out two of

149
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,859
these packages actually three or all

150
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,660
three packages half the milligram of the

151
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,900
active substance in on their packaging

152
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,460
but that's not the one you look at

153
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:58,379
right

154
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,659
maybe the melatonin with the 20

155
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:03,779
milligram write down the label but the

156
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,699
others you don't really care about the

157
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,579
number you just know that

158
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,139
you need that compound or that drug

159
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,300
not how much

160
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,220
and then the other one so I like to ask

161
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,720
questions and participation by the

162
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,300
audience

163
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,419
which is the best wine to buy

164
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,000
I took this picture from a website the

165
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,879
10 most expensive wines in the world

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,978
so here um I think four of them are red

167
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,120
and there's one white which one is the

168
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:31,918
best wine

169
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,100
and all of you are wrong because it's

170
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,019
the Vodka it has the most alcohol

171
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,759
if we go by the logic of the Cannabis

172
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,818
industry that is the best product to go

173
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:45,720
to buy when you go on a wine store

174
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:49,319
and so you already see why I want to get

175
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,720
to if you sell by THC weight

176
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,160
you can't sell the right product you

177
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,680
can't really advertise your product you

178
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,680
can't distinguish your product

179
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,120
okay and then the other point is the

180
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,759
total THC numbers actually

181
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,759
mathematically incorrect

182
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,800
and it's easiest exemplified by pure

183
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,139
Crystal of thca

184
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,800
uh you might know the total THC number

185
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,418
is the THC percentage plus the THC asset

186
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,639
percentage with a weight correction

187
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:22,019
because THC acid gets lighter when it

188
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:27,720
decarboxylates so a pure a pure THC acid

189
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:29,579
Crystal has 87.7 total THC

190
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,120
does that make sense can a pure

191
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:35,459
substance be 88 pure

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,620
can't right because

193
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,138
you didn't listen in middle school

194
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,759
chemistry and in middle school math you

195
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,319
have to correct for the weight loss of

196
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,319
the sample

197
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,819
if you substrate weight on the nominator

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,139
you also have to do that on the

199
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,000
denominator

200
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,680
so this formula actually is corrected

201
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,879
and now it works

202
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,500
very esoteric very geeky why do we care

203
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,598
because you're underselling your

204
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,879
cannabis

205
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,978
all your cannabis would be bumped up in

206
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,899
total THC number if you do the correct

207
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:10,800
math

208
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:12,918
and here we meet again our laminar G and

209
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,740
Baba Kush

210
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:19,620
they bump up by nearly a percent point

211
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,900
if you have the higher potency higher

212
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,860
potency I'll get to that later

213
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:30,598
um cultivas okay

214
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:33,778
maybe to wake you up or why do we care

215
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:36,778
if we sell cannabis by percentage point

216
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:39,620
of THC and that defines the value which

217
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:43,500
we did we scraped websites online stores

218
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,419
of cannabis companies to find out if

219
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,240
there's a correlation between the sales

220
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:51,419
price and the THC percentage and there

221
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,600
is it's about 33 cents per percent point

222
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:58,079
of THC that your price sales price

223
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,600
increases so the industry is losing 400

224
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,899
million dollars a year

225
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,360
by not correctly calculating and yes

226
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,278
economists would May would agree that

227
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,919
then the prices would adjust but anyway

228
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:13,139
so right now 400 million so think of

229
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,899
that number because you didn't listen in

230
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,240
school and didn't get your math right

231
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,519
all the banned books that here in Canada

232
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,039
in in Florida with them that they ban

233
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,299
all the mass books wasn't really helpful

234
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,860
okay

235
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:29,120
um but there's a bad side to everything

236
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,120
because your hemp is hot

237
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:35,939
um and it gets even worse so I showed

238
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,100
you that we work with the university so

239
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,839
we get a lot of Co-op students so these

240
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,680
are undergrad students that have to work

241
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,180
four or eight months in a company to get

242
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,579
work experience and that counts as

243
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:49,919
credits so yes I have students that work

244
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,540
in cannabis and get uh get a degree for

245
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,059
that they love it

246
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,740
and they're super cheap because I pay

247
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:57,299
them a good wage but I get half the wage

248
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,159
back from the Canadian government so the

249
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,740
Canadian government sponsors a lot of

250
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,539
our research it's amazing like just

251
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,580
think of that that blows your mind as an

252
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:08,699
American

253
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:12,060
okay so cannabis you buy flour you buy

254
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,220
it by percentage weight of THC

255
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:16,439
uh you buy a cart Vape cartridge and

256
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,680
that is either in percentage rate THC or

257
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,200
it is in milligrams per gram

258
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,639
uh if you buy a brownie it's a milligram

259
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,620
per unit

260
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,240
and if it's a tincture it's a milligrams

261
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,278
per milliliter

262
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,899
like it's all over the place like you

263
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,159
need an advanced degree to just keep

264
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,799
track of this

265
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,980
and we had talks this morning and

266
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,979
yesterday

267
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,879
of how much cannabis to take and like

268
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:44,819
how do you how do you square that how do

269
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,958
you have an idea how one correlates to

270
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,778
the other

271
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,259
like a brownie five milligrams per unit

272
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:55,019
or a tincture both ingested

273
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:57,958
milligram per milliliter like

274
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:01,078
that's a different unit type right it's

275
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,819
really difficult to keep track of

276
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,620
so

277
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,420
here are some ideas

278
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,240
for new approaches and I'm not saying

279
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,240
I'm right I'm just saying you are wrong

280
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,278
and we have to change this

281
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,139
so my first idea is sell the bus

282
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:23,159
don't sell that weight

283
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,778
so yesterday evening and for some of you

284
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,778
all through the day

285
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:31,799
uh you enjoyed some alcohol

286
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:33,659
and everyone or you should be aware of

287
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,919
the idea or the concept of a standard

288
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,799
drink

289
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,838
and you know

290
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,838
intuitively you can drink a larger

291
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,620
volume of beer then you can drink

292
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:49,680
vodka or scotch

293
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,419
because the standard drink is a constant

294
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,639
unit of alcohol

295
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,039
so that a large glass of beer and a

296
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,899
small shot of whiskey have the same

297
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:02,278
amount of alcohol

298
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:05,039
so you just correct for the ingredient

299
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,019
and you vary the weight or the volume of

300
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,059
the product

301
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,399
and so if we take that concept and now

302
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:14,159
call it the standard dank

303
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,620
you could package cannabis by a

304
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,860
consistent amount of THC

305
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,019
so now you don't sell an eighth of flour

306
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,259
but you sell

307
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,839
a fixed amount of THC

308
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,179
and so your unit packaging might go from

309
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,100
three grams to four grams it just varies

310
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:36,000
and you don't actually care about the

311
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:38,579
THC percentage anymore the consumer

312
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,339
won't feel cheated because they get the

313
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:44,519
same amount of Buzz every time or the

314
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,320
same amount of THC and you can now start

315
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,799
labeling other things

316
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,500
request unit is standardized

317
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:56,578
and so here as an example your edible

318
00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:01,500
would be one unit of of standard tank

319
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:04,439
and then a joint with 20 flour has 200

320
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:08,100
unit 40 units and it goes up for then

321
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,920
big cartridges and tinctures

322
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:14,159
so that would be one idea that is firmly

323
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:17,179
a new recreational world we just sell

324
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,179
you the THC

325
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,620
um

326
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,200
but we also have a lot of medical

327
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,899
presentations so

328
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,000
is there more of medical approach to to

329
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,820
labeling cannabis

330
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,820
and I think there is because you already

331
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,720
try you call it a potency

332
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:39,720
but it's not a potency like 20 percent

333
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,379
weight percent THC flour is not less

334
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,120
potent than 25 THC flour like you all

335
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,578
talk about the Entourage reflect and all

336
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,320
the other compounds it's it's not

337
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,719
potency it's just concentration what

338
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,820
you're labeling right now so can we

339
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,160
actually label it by potency

340
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,959
and for that let's just quickly take a

341
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,719
step back and think about so who of you

342
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,599
took the vitamins this morning

343
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,620
some of you yes how much vitamin C did

344
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,560
you take

345
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,720
no idea a thousand IU what does IU mean

346
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,939
no one has an idea so IU means

347
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,459
International unit and an international

348
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,959
unit is a measure of effect

349
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:18,599
has nothing to do with weight has

350
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:21,359
nothing to do with concentration uh

351
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,600
nothing to do with moles it is purely

352
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,579
based on the effect and it is also that

353
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,100
you can compare different application

354
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:31,019
forms Administration forms that always

355
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,000
give you the same effect so a pill or a

356
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,459
tincture would give you the same

357
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,820
international units of or the same

358
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:40,919
effect of of vitamin C so the weight

359
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,180
between the two products might actually

360
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,099
change

361
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:46,099
but you always get the same effect

362
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:54,059
so could we use that in cannabis

363
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:56,578
so if we call that as intoxication unit

364
00:14:54,059 --> 00:15:00,239
we standardize it and just say that a

365
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:02,819
dose effect is 100 IUS

366
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,940
and

367
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,459
if we just think an IU is you get bust

368
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,899
and five milligrams of an edible make

369
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,399
you buzzed

370
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,620
how much

371
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,919
is that in a joint

372
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,480
it's maybe a puff

373
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,819
and I'm guessing here because I don't

374
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,278
actually consume cannabis so but I

375
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,920
assume that like a brownie or like piece

376
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,919
of piece of gummy and and a puff on the

377
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,659
joint is about the same Buzz rightly so

378
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,939
we just Define that as a hundred IUS

379
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:34,319
between the two products

380
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,339
so now

381
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,040
we would sell our products in multiples

382
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:45,000
of these intoxication units

383
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:48,778
and now it allows a consumer to go from

384
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,519
a joint to a tincture to an edible and

385
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,720
knows that they always get the same

386
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,698
effect

387
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,440
right that's all we're talking about for

388
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:56,819
the last few years to like standardize

389
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,820
the effect

390
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,560
so we could do that with an intoxication

391
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,839
units

392
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,359
and for CBD we ramp up the number

393
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,399
because uh the clinical doses for CBD

394
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,379
are way higher so you just hide that

395
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,698
underneath it because right now the

396
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:14,159
consumer has to remember that they

397
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:16,319
should take five milligrams of THC but

398
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,000
probably weigh over 100 milligrams of

399
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,980
CBD

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,278
so you can just all hide that under I

401
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,278
use

402
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,459
but that's difficult right

403
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,379
so maybe we should do the work like if

404
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,419
we want to be medical or pharmaceutical

405
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:32,399
we should put some effort in and it can

406
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,039
be done because back to our initial

407
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,778
question on the smoking side I have a

408
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,838
robot that smokes joints and I promise

409
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:43,439
you it's not my colleagues

410
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:45,300
we smoked cannabis both high THC and

411
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,060
high CBD

412
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:50,099
flour and looked at how the particle

413
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:53,278
size so the mill size of the flower that

414
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:58,019
we put in the joint affects the delivery

415
00:16:53,278 --> 00:17:01,100
of THC or CBD to the to the consumer and

416
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:04,679
the particle size affects the inhalation

417
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,019
massively we can double the THC

418
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,280
delivered per puff by just Milling it

419
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:11,759
finer

420
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:14,818
so our initial question what does Mary

421
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,980
Jane get can't be answered because we

422
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:19,678
didn't mention in that math question the

423
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,140
particle size of the flower

424
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:27,120
and with that I don't care if your joint

425
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:29,940
is 20 THC or 25 or 30 THC the

426
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:34,939
architecture is as important for the

427
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,940
delivery as the flower ingredient

428
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,759
also the recoveries are really bad so we

429
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:43,259
are and that cap is consistent with

430
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,558
other literature

431
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:48,179
about 30 to maybe 50 percent of the THC

432
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:49,740
that's in the flower actually ends up in

433
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,960
your mouth the rest is just combusted

434
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,099
and goes off to other places

435
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,279
so

436
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:59,879
you're wasting a lot a CBD and I do not

437
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:02,460
understand why CBD is way more efficient

438
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,460
in inhalation like more CBD gets

439
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,919
transported and the recovery is like

440
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,620
quantitative and I have no clue why that

441
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,460
is but we have a lab and we will get to

442
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:13,459
that in the future

443
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:16,859
um and we can also do that for tinctures

444
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:18,319
yeah this is a peer-reviewed study we

445
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,699
did on a randomized triple blind

446
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,139
comparatively parallel studies like all

447
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,259
the buzzwords in there we actually

448
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:28,679
checked how different uh formulations of

449
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:32,700
CBD in liquid lead to blood plasma

450
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,919
numbers of CBD so yes you can do the

451
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,819
work

452
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,820
so parting thoughts

453
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,259
I'm not the only one who says that

454
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:47,220
there are also people from the emerald

455
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:49,619
cup Alex Dixon from from SC lab says

456
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,720
that over and over again you might sell

457
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:53,399
the first product on the THC number but

458
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,798
you're returning customers are coming on

459
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,320
other factors like terpenes like flavors

460
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:02,700
it's not the THC number

461
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:05,339
so stop advertising it or using that as

462
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,660
your Prime real estate on your Packaging

463
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:10,558
uh also right now the

464
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,259
consumer

465
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,779
that has been using for decades they

466
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:17,700
know the THC number new consumers don't

467
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:21,538
and they're way more new consumers than

468
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,100
the old consumers so we can't go with

469
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:24,419
the argument oh we can't change it

470
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:26,819
because that's the way it always has

471
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:28,919
been or it also has always been illegal

472
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:30,779
and we managed to change that and we

473
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,080
have way more potential customers coming

474
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:36,839
our way than than the old ones so maybe

475
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,859
we should put an effort in and change it

476
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,798
um

477
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:43,619
yeah don't sell weight and percentage

478
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,139
gsv sell convenient

479
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,699
and just a summary

480
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,620
standard tank is the mass of

481
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,140
cannabinoids and intoxication units

482
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:54,959
would be the resulting effects

483
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,360
and with that I think my call founder

484
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,480
Professor Glenn Summers and the whole

485
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:03,058
research team that

486
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,620
helped me in these experiments and kept

487
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:05,399
quizzing me why cannabis is done this

488
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,079
way

489
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,220
and with that this is the one for the

490
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,220
picture with the references

491
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:15,660
and I made it exactly on time thank you

492
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,200
very much

493
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,200
foreign
