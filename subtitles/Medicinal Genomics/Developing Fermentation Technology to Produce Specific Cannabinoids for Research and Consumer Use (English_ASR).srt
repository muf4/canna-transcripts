1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,579
afternoon thanks for being here so I'm

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,400
here from Dmytryk today to tell you

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,259
about how we are unlocking access to

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,839
rare cannabinoids using scalable bio

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:18,000
synthesis so our mission at Demetrios is

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,429
to make nature's rarest ingredients

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,039
accessible sustainable and affordable

8
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:27,599
for happier healthier lives we focus on

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,060
natural products because they have huge

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,800
impacts and huge challenges and so I've

11
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,199
got three of my favorite plants on this

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,558
slide on the Left we have

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,989
Artemisia annua and that's the plant

14
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,179
also known as sweet wormwood from which

15
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:46,409
the anti-malarial drug artemisinin is

16
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,579
derived so artemisinin is the drug

17
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:49,769
that's recommended by the World Health

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,030
Organization for treatment of malaria in

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,620
the developing world so it's a very

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,260
important drug and we need a lot of it

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,979
and it's also a drug that has suffered

22
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:02,009
from huge price volatility so swings of

23
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,808
as much as 10 fold and pricing and that

24
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:06,420
occurs because of boom-bust cycles in

25
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:08,849
agriculture because of bad weather

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,379
because of stockpiling and speculation

27
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:15,118
so a few years ago a second source of

28
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,188
the drug came online it's a semi

29
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,700
synthetic form so basically what happens

30
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,949
is that scientists engineered some yeast

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,978
with the genes to make a precursor of

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,290
artemisinin and then that precursor can

33
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,789
be converted by human chemists into

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,250
Artemis and with a couple of more

35
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,409
chemical steps and so what that's done

36
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,618
really is put a ceiling on price swings

37
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,659
for the drug and it's leveled out price

38
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:42,150
and considerably and made the situation

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,060
more manageable so the second example

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,728
that I wanted to bring up is taxes Bravo

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,950
folio or the Pacific yew tree and that

42
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,509
is our source or was our source of the

43
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,390
drug tax salt which is an important

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,430
cancer drug the Pacific yew is also an

45
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,868
endangered species and so you can

46
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,960
imagine that that was not going to cut

47
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:03,299
it for supplying a cancer drug and so

48
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,879
again a semi-synthetic actually several

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,590
semi-synthetic methods of producing tax

50
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,469
all have been developed and that is

51
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,780
led to the ability to supply this drug

52
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,219
to the world essentially and of course

53
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,370
the last example I'm going to talk about

54
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,830
is cannabis and so you know with the

55
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,629
approval of epidemics recently that's a

56
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,269
botanical extract from the plant so a

57
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:27,239
highly pure preparation of CBD and of

58
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,250
course the excitement about you know how

59
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,860
many other cannabinoids that are even

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,689
rarer I would propose that there could

61
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,940
be a scaling challenge ahead of us for

62
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,650
many of these compounds and I would also

63
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,049
propose that again the solution could be

64
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,969
production via fermentation maybe with

65
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:46,560
some semi synthesis so today's market

66
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,180
for natural ingredients across the board

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,670
is putting considerable pressure on

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,290
traditional harvesting methods consumers

69
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,238
are demanding effective and rare natural

70
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:57,298
products and these are global consumers

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,680
now brands are requiring a stable supply

72
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,739
of high quality and high purity

73
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,840
ingredients to meet that demand on the

74
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,819
pharmaceutical side botanical drugs are

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,439
extremely difficult to manufacture in

76
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,238
scale there's very few of them actually

77
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,979
that have been approved by the FDA and

78
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,719
so we think across the board that

79
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,189
agriculture is going to struggle to meet

80
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:18,810
the growing demand for these types of

81
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:19,979
very rare natural products I think

82
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,049
everyone here would also agree that

83
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,268
cannabinoids offer a range of untapped

84
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,340
opportunities and this is a chart from

85
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,049
actual Capitol forecasting legal

86
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,819
cannabis sales in the United States

87
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,769
through the year 2030 as well as the

88
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,689
number of consumers and so they're

89
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,370
making the assumption that by 2027

90
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,989
canada's cannabis will be legal

91
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,019
federally in the US and of course no one

92
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,389
knows that when or if it will be legal

93
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,489
but i think that you know taken together

94
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,290
looking at kind of loosening regulatory

95
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,879
structures in the US and abroad in the

96
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:50,489
last few years there's reason to be

97
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,918
optimistic that we could really have 60

98
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,919
million consumers of cannabinoids in the

99
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,480
US by the year 2030 and so if that's if

100
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,939
that's the case you know the question

101
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,649
occurs to me is which cannabinoids will

102
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:05,878
they be and where will we be getting in

103
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,939
front so our understanding of cannabis

104
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,500
is growing beyond THC and CBD as we've

105
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,759
heard in several talks before today

106
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,550
there's more than 100 different

107
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,280
cannabinoids

108
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,900
then at least identified or structurally

109
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,589
characterized and we just know very

110
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,759
little about them on the whole and I

111
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,409
would say one of the reasons we know so

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,909
little about the majority of these is

113
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,740
that the majority of cannabinoids are

114
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,500
virtually inaccessible in the plant due

115
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,509
to their scarcity so this isn't the case

116
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,220
for the common cannabinoid it's like THC

117
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,930
or CBD which make up you know anywhere

118
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,210
from let's say ten to thirty percent of

119
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,069
the dry weight of the flower but it

120
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,479
really drops off quickly after that so

121
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,870
you start talking about the Varens like

122
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,370
THC V or C v DV or C V G which is the

123
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,379
precursor to these other cannabinoids

124
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,480
and those are more like 1% of the dry

125
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,100
weight from the flower of the plant so

126
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,590
that's putting you closer to $100 per

127
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,780
gram cost to isolate and purify these

128
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:58,509
and from there you get into the rare

129
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:01,239
cannabinoids which are 0.01% to 1% of

130
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,099
the flower dry weight that's 100 to

131
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,040
$10,000 per gram and that group includes

132
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,510
CBC by the way finally getting to these

133
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,740
very rare cannabinoids these are

134
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:10,930
probably structures you haven't seen

135
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,639
before those are less than 0.01 percent

136
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,709
of the flower dry weight and that means

137
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,209
that they would cost if anyone was doing

138
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:20,859
it greater than ten thousand dollars per

139
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:23,349
gram to produce so it was really this

140
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,949
challenge that motivated our founder Jay

141
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,740
Keasling

142
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:29,139
to establish the matrix in 2017 so the

143
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,759
little background on Jay he's a busy guy

144
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,519
he's a professor of chemical engineering

145
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,289
and bioengineering at UC Berkeley he's

146
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,668
also the associate lab director for

147
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,129
Biosciences at Lawrence Berkeley

148
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:41,529
National Labs and he's the CEO of the

149
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:43,060
joint bioenergy Institute he's generally

150
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:44,679
regarded as an authority in metabolic

151
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,110
engineering and he's founded multiple

152
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,209
companies so down there you can see ls9

153
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,220
Y gose and then amorous which is

154
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:53,168
actually the company that developed that

155
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,300
artemisinin technology I was talking

156
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:58,060
about earlier out of an invention that

157
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,370
came out of his lab and it was really a

158
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,769
breakthrough discovery that Jay made

159
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,240
with his his lab that provided the

160
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:07,539
meatrix with a real head start in this

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,139
microbial production field I'm at this

162
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,330
point

163
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:12,250
we've raised over 60 million dollars in

164
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,899
funding and seed in series a based on

165
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,009
the strength of Jay's reputation the

166
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,359
team that he's been able to put together

167
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,550
and the progress we've made in the last

168
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,080
two years our major investors are

169
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,639
tuatara Capital and her eyes

170
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:26,500
ventures so I'm gonna start talking a

171
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,030
little bit about what the plant does to

172
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,120
make cannabinoids because everything we

173
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:32,739
do is inspired by the plant and so it's

174
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,300
a very interesting pathway in plant an

175
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,180
interesting means hard when it comes to

176
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,620
metabolic engineering so okay so

177
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,478
starting over here is a metabolic

178
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,370
pathway that kind of shows how the plant

179
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,800
pushes chemicals to make the final

180
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,689
cannabinoids down here and so at the top

181
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,449
you have hexanoic acid coming in and

182
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:50,740
through a series of conversion steps and

183
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,300
incorporation of other cellular

184
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,629
metabolites you get down to this

185
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,250
molecule livet aaalac acid a littlie

186
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,689
Cassatt can be joined together with the

187
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,110
second molecule called geranyl

188
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:04,149
diphosphate or GPP to make c vga and

189
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,259
that of course is kind of the mother can

190
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:07,209
have annoyed the one which all the

191
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,860
others are made off of and the enzyme

192
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,508
that does that is called an aromatic

193
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,830
kernel transferase and i'm going to talk

194
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,038
about that a little more later so keep

195
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:18,430
that one in mind once you have CBG a

196
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,318
that can be converted into Delta 9 THC a

197
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,778
or CBD a through the action of these

198
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,210
cannabinoid synthesis so THCA synthase

199
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:26,889
or CBD a synthase there are other

200
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:29,848
synthesis as well we heard about some of

201
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:32,710
them today many probably uncharacterized

202
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:34,120
and then finally the a of here of course

203
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:36,459
means acid and they can be

204
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,218
decarboxylated by heat for example into

205
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:42,250
THC or CBD and so what makes this

206
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:44,168
pathway unusual and more challenging for

207
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,528
us is that it occurs in two phases in

208
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:49,418
the plan so in the first phase GPP and a

209
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:50,889
limit aaalac acid are made inside the

210
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:53,769
cell and joined together to make that

211
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,960
CBG a molecule that's where it gets

212
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:57,878
interesting so the CBG a and the

213
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,189
synthesis then secreted into an

214
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,439
extracellular kind of lumina a chamber

215
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:04,629
called the trichome and so that last

216
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:09,699
reaction to make THC or CBD a is

217
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:12,039
occurring outside of the cell so I have

218
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,629
a weird observation now it's occurred to

219
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,250
us that about a thousand cannabinoid

220
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,439
producing yeast cells could fit into a

221
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,879
single trichome and so if instead of

222
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,588
doing that we were to fill up a large

223
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,939
fermentation vessel with those yeast

224
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:24,728
cells we'd essentially have a gigantic

225
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:26,800
trichome and that's kind of the point of

226
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:28,209
all this is that fermentation and de

227
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,370
beatrix has the advantages of a

228
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:32,318
specialist so if you think about a plant

229
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,509
the plant is an amazing organism and it

230
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:35,668
does a lot of stuff

231
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:37,439
it grows roots it grows leaves it does

232
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:39,689
photosynthesis it makes thousands of

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,789
compounds and in the cannabis plant in a

234
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,889
very small part of the total biomass it

235
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,240
also produces these trichome structures

236
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,310
and makes the cannabinoids that we're

237
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,198
interested in so that means that it's

238
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:50,849
actually inefficient for some of these

239
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:52,169
rare or natural products because it's

240
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,389
doing so many other things so it

241
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:56,669
requires a lot of resources we have

242
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:59,399
limited control even with some very

243
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,139
heroic breeding over the final products

244
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,539
it makes and in the end you have a lot

245
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,820
of waste and the process overall isn't

246
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:08,129
very agile and so by contrast

247
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,629
fermentation is really a specialist so

248
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:11,850
it takes a streamlined and highly

249
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:15,299
efficient approach requiring fewer

250
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:18,839
resources complete control and creating

251
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:20,069
little waste and working quickly so I

252
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,339
want to get into this in a little more

253
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,839
detail basically as a specialist we take

254
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,899
nature's unpredictability out of the

255
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,449
equation so the process that I'm

256
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,570
describing it is consistent in pure it's

257
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:35,458
resource light and reliable it scales

258
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,680
easily and quickly as the market does

259
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,388
and it yields ingredients in weeks

260
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,578
instead of months so if we were to

261
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:43,680
follow the production of some purified

262
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:45,929
cannabinoids through via agriculture or

263
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,849
fermentation that comparison would look

264
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:49,859
like this so if you wanted to make a lot

265
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,449
of purified cannabinoid via agriculture

266
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,220
you'd start by growing a lot of wet

267
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:55,620
plant say a hundred thousand kilograms

268
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,028
and that's going to be probably three to

269
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,669
four months of minimum to get your

270
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:01,740
plants grown you then dry down the

271
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:03,568
plants now you're at 30,000 kilos you

272
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,250
trim away to get just the flower now

273
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,659
you're down to ten thousand kilos and

274
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,220
then you do some pretty intense

275
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:10,078
purifications to separate these

276
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,850
cannabinoids from all the other products

277
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,370
in the plant from the waxes the other

278
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,079
chemicals the tissue and in the end if

279
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,778
you had a high THC strain you might have

280
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,729
two thousand kilos of THC if you add a

281
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:23,100
strain that specialized in making CBD

282
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,870
maybe you're at 1,200 kilos of CBD if

283
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,690
you're going after one of the rarer ones

284
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,639
like the Varon CBD v you'd have only 250

285
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,199
kilos and if you're going after one of

286
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,879
these really rare compounds I was

287
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:35,099
talking about earlier I'll call it C V

288
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,409
DX you'd have as little as one kilogram

289
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,909
and this is this is really a best-case

290
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:40,828
scenario well it's gonna be variable

291
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:43,519
depending on weather geography and of

292
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:45,409
course the natural abundance of the comp

293
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,360
so if you were to take the fermentation

294
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:49,129
route you would inoculate a large

295
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,659
fermentation tank with the cannabinoid

296
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:52,309
producing yeast they would fill up the

297
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:54,709
tank by growing over the course of one

298
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:56,779
to two weeks and then that would be it

299
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,180
the fermentation to be done and so at

300
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,679
that point you would do a purification

301
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:02,059
process which is would be much more

302
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:03,409
straightforward than purifying from

303
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:05,689
plant tissue because now you're just

304
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:07,789
separating from these cells and from the

305
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,880
media and the tank and you would end up

306
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:15,799
with 2,000 kilograms of either THC or

307
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,939
CBD or CBD V or the CBD X rare compound

308
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,519
and that's because the fermentation

309
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,410
process is not dependent on the natural

310
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,110
abundance of the compound in the plant

311
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:25,279
we choose the strain that we we grow and

312
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,800
it makes the product that it's

313
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,449
engineered to make it's also reliable

314
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:30,709
this is not happening outdoors in a

315
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,080
field it's independent of whether

316
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:37,160
geography and as I mentioned the

317
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,660
abundance of the compound so I'm gonna

318
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,639
get into a little more detail here I'll

319
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:43,610
try not to get too hardcore because it's

320
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,080
the afternoon but the Demetrios process

321
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,870
to produce alcohol and common

322
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,160
cannabinoids THC a and CBD a for

323
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,429
managing your yeast looks something like

324
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:55,009
this so we start by engineering a yeast

325
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:56,779
cell over here and so this is sacrum I

326
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:59,830
see Survey's yeah it's baker's yeast it

327
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:03,339
was it's what brings us beer wine bread

328
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,410
pretty well known organism we then

329
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,120
basically need to bring in all the parts

330
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:09,620
to make cannabinoids and so I like to

331
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,620
think of it like an assembly line where

332
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,179
each gene we bring in each piece of

333
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,299
genetic engineering we do is a unit

334
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:20,359
operation in this assembly line and so

335
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:21,769
we source those unit operations from you

336
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,419
know whatever organism has the best

337
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:25,100
version basically and so some of the

338
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,179
genes and our yeasts come from cannabis

339
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,850
but some of them come from other

340
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,409
organisms so in the end we have to

341
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,389
engineer yeast cell and we're gonna feed

342
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:34,730
it sugar and we're gonna feed it

343
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,350
hexanoic acid and so the yeast cell

344
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,480
takes the sugar and converts it into

345
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,580
geranyl diphosphate that's a GPP

346
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,129
molecule and another molecule called

347
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,110
malonyl-coa in combination with the

348
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,939
hexanoic acid we feed in the cells can

349
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,500
make that a liver taluk acid molecule I

350
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,459
talked about and then finally make the c

351
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,039
vga

352
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:55,338
kyoool from here at the strain has a CVD

353
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:57,409
a synthase we make CBD a if it has a THC

354
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,529
a synthase instead we're gonna make THC

355
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:02,058
a so these are common cannabinoids but

356
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:03,318
they're obviously valuable products that

357
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:04,669
do important things so they go into

358
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:06,889
api's which are pharmaceutical

359
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:08,659
precursors they go into consumer

360
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,220
products anything from skin creams to

361
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:13,578
nutriceuticals and of course there's the

362
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,629
recreational market with THC so I think

363
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:17,419
where it really it's really interesting

364
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:19,399
though for this this conference is when

365
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:21,229
we replace this hexanoic acid with

366
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,028
different carboxylic acids and start to

367
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,360
get access to rare and new to nature

368
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:28,999
cannabinoids and so for example if we

369
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,970
were to take that same setup and feed

370
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:33,528
butyric acid instead of hexanoic acid

371
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,660
now we'd be making Varun's so we'd make

372
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:38,149
cv g'v a which is the variant form of

373
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:39,338
CBG and we make CBD VA which is the

374
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,688
variant form of CBD

375
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:43,490
we can go so that's that's basically a

376
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:45,139
carboxylic acid with a shorter chain we

377
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,240
can also go to a longer chain like octa

378
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:49,129
Noack acid and so in that case we'd be

379
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,720
making these compounds that have C 7

380
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:55,610
tails both the the c vga and the CBD a

381
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,559
version and by the way if I had a THC a

382
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,110
synthase here we'd be making the THC a

383
00:13:57,558 --> 00:14:01,308
versions of these compounds the last

384
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,649
thing we could do is we could go to the

385
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:06,379
Sigma catalog and we could we could

386
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,419
select 30 carboxylic acids that look

387
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,589
roughly like hexanoic acid but obviously

388
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:11,208
are pretty diverse there and then just

389
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,129
test them in our strands and we've done

390
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,838
this and we see that the majority of

391
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:16,428
them end up getting incorporated into

392
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,949
the final molecules there's little blue

393
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:21,379
stubs there represent any of these

394
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:23,178
functionalities and so now these are not

395
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:24,649
natural compounds anymore we're calling

396
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:26,149
them new to nature cannabinoid so

397
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,850
because these are very interesting for

398
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:31,068
for new drug development you can imagine

399
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,480
given the number of carboxylic acids

400
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:36,048
that are available that you could make

401
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,459
quite a few compounds this way so I want

402
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:39,230
to zoom back and just kind of summarize

403
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,758
the advantages of the system basically

404
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,110
we have an agile platform for the

405
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,778
economical production of rare

406
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,509
cannabinoids rare and novel cannabinoids

407
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:49,220
and so we have two dials that we can

408
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:51,499
turn on this platform the first is the

409
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,028
strain the yeast strain so for example

410
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:54,769
we could choose a strain that makes CBD

411
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:57,379
here so we fill up the fermenter with

412
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,389
those East cells and then we choose the

413
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:01,550
feed of the carboxylic acid so if it was

414
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:03,320
standard movie feeding hexanoic

415
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:06,109
and in that case we're gonna make CVD a

416
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,399
which is the the natural natural form

417
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,750
it's chemically identical and

418
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,889
indistinguishable from what the plant

419
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:16,339
makes however if we were to switch to a

420
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:19,159
THC strain over here and then instead

421
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,050
feed a rare carboxylic acid so that

422
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,698
butyric acid example I was telling you

423
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,859
about now we'd be making the Varon form

424
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:26,568
at the same efficiency that we make the

425
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:31,639
natural molecule or the more common

426
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:33,349
molecule so getting to where we could do

427
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,669
this there were some challenges along

428
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,709
the way I'm going to go through the kind

429
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:38,389
of big three challenges we faced and at

430
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,578
a very high level how we've solved them

431
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:42,860
and so the first challenge was really D

432
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:46,578
bottlenecking CVG a production in yeast

433
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,600
and so CB GA remember is what you get

434
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,879
when you can fine

435
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,470
combine that Olivia taluk acid and GPP

436
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,000
molecule with an enzyme called an

437
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,209
aromatic parental transferase to give

438
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,860
you CVG a so when we first started out

439
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,469
using the enzymes described in the

440
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:09,470
literature we were not making a lot of

441
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:12,410
CB GA so what we did was put in the

442
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:15,440
enzyme that the Keesling lab had

443
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:17,870
identified called CSP t4 and immediately

444
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,670
saw massive improvement in production so

445
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,379
greater than 10,000 fold improvement in

446
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:26,509
production of CB GA and this is pretty

447
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:28,549
important because no C VGA I know no

448
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:30,230
downstream cannabinoids so I wanted to

449
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:32,509
spend a little more time on that enzyme

450
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,690
and so the original characterized enzyme

451
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:37,939
was called CSP t1 this was discovered by

452
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,399
Jonathan pages group and it's a it's a

453
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,050
relative of CSP t4 but but actually

454
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,188
fairly different only about 65 percent

455
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:48,979
identical and CSP t1 I would say cruelly

456
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:50,269
makes well for the microbial engineer I

457
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,709
can't speak to the plan but for the

458
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:53,509
microbial engineer it's a cruel enzyme

459
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:55,518
because it makes just enough see BGA in

460
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:57,649
yeast that you might think hey this is

461
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,539
the red enzyme it's just we've got to

462
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,059
adapt it to the east so we got to tweak

463
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:03,349
it to get it into the yeast cell but I

464
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:05,058
guess no amount of tweaking has really

465
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,828
worked well there because groups had

466
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:09,619
moved on and found another alternative

467
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:09,959
and pH B so that's a that's another

468
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,519
error

469
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:16,110
a kernel transferase from streptomyces

470
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:17,308
bacteria and that one makes will the

471
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,109
wild-type version of the enzyme the

472
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:20,578
natural version the enzyme makes mostly

473
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,229
the wrong product but if you do some

474
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,298
clever mutagenesis on it which has been

475
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:28,798
done you can make a modest amount of C

476
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:29,940
BGA lastly we get to CSP t4 and that's

477
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,168
the enzyme that the Keesling lab

478
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,909
developed and when you put that into

479
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:35,520
yeast you can just make I would just say

480
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:37,260
massive amounts of C BGA so it's pretty

481
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,418
clear to me at least from the microbial

482
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,700
work that this is the enzyme that is

483
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,038
meant to do that step and to use an

484
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,890
engine analogy here CSP t1 is maybe a

485
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:49,679
compact car engine and PHP could be a

486
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:53,100
truck engine CSP t4 is more like a jet

487
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,259
engine so we found ourselves in early

488
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:56,759
2018 in the position of having strains

489
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,460
that made a lot of CVG a and that's

490
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,798
where we ran into our second problem and

491
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,778
so that was that the cannabinoid

492
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:08,308
synthase enzymes just don't work well in

493
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:10,380
yeast and so remember we're making CVG a

494
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:12,658
we got past that hurdle and now we want

495
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,159
to convert that into CBD a here with one

496
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,020
of the cannabinoid synthesis in this

497
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,960
case we're trying to use CBD a synthase

498
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:21,240
and so it really it basically totally

499
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,490
failed at first like barely detectable

500
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,940
production micrograms berg yeah nothing

501
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,808
so at that point we took kind of a

502
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,788
two-pronged approach

503
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:31,950
so we re-engineered the synthase enzyme

504
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:34,648
itself to try to make it more amenable

505
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,970
to yeast and then we also attack from

506
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:38,879
the other end and we engineered the

507
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:41,038
yeast cells to make them support the

508
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,419
function of this enzyme better and so

509
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,589
that actually was quite a few steps so

510
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,270
you can see this was the synthase

511
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,189
optimization early on and then there

512
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:49,230
were a series of engineering features

513
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,880
that we stacked to get to the point

514
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:56,038
where we were essentially converting all

515
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,750
of the CBG AR strains was making so the

516
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:00,450
third challenge is scale up in

517
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,460
manufacturing so basically 2019 has been

518
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,970
all about getting those strains into

519
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,528
fermentation vessels so basically tanks

520
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,690
that mimic what they would be in at

521
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:11,788
full-scale production and manufacturing

522
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,440
making sure that we have processes and

523
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:15,658
processes and strains in place that are

524
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,460
stable and that's in process and that

525
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:19,080
sounds less interesting and maybe less

526
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,548
hard than the first two challenges but

527
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,220
for folks that have been in the

528
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:23,720
industrial sin bio

529
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,240
area they know that this is actually

530
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,160
quite challenging and the good news is

531
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,589
that we have several folks on our team

532
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,529
who have experience with that I think

533
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:36,889
there's over nearly ten molecules that

534
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:38,629
have been scaled to multi-ton amounts

535
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,550
and production and that experience is in

536
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,050
our team and so you know we take this

537
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:46,879
challenge seriously but we're also

538
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:48,680
confident we can do it so in total I've

539
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,570
really told you about how we do bottle

540
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,640
necked microbial cannabinoid production

541
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:54,139
in yeast and so what that means is we

542
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,900
have a platform where we can produce the

543
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,850
common cannabinoids and then we can also

544
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:04,400
produce rare and new denature

545
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:05,899
cannabinoids so we're using our funding

546
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,120
right now to go further faster and

547
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,440
there's kind of three parts to that the

548
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,509
first is the team and at this point

549
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,340
we're up to nearly 35 people and it's a

550
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:16,549
it's a team of experts in R&amp;D in

551
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:20,000
manufacturing commercialization and in

552
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:21,919
regulatory of course we've also invested

553
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,779
in building a best-in-class lab and so

554
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,580
I'd characterize it as a lab that's you

555
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:27,769
know efficiently focused on production

556
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:29,779
of strains to make high-value natural

557
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,519
products and so there are a lot of

558
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:33,529
automation computing tools that are a

559
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,079
part of that lab that make make the work

560
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:37,369
go faster and so you know essentially

561
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,109
our scientists spend a lot less time

562
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,689
pipetting and they kind of do higher

563
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:43,129
value activities the last piece that I

564
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,450
think is pretty important too is that

565
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,950
we're developing industry-leading

566
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,990
intellectual property around this

567
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,539
microbial production so we've invested

568
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,059
in IP licenses for example the license

569
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:54,589
of the work from the Keesling lab and

570
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,750
then over the last couple years we've

571
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:58,609
also developed our own suite of

572
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,440
intellectual property that is propelling

573
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:04,939
our technology forward and enabling

574
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,350
commercialization so with that I wanted

575
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,059
to return to our mission statement which

576
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:09,559
is to make nature's rarest ingredients

577
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,809
accessible sustainable and affordable

578
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,859
for happier healthier lives and really

579
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,269
everything that I've been talking about

580
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:16,009
in the last 20 minutes has been about

581
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:18,139
the first part the accessibility part

582
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:19,069
the ability to scale these compounds and

583
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,509
what's great about being at this

584
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,250
conference is getting a chance to see

585
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:23,599
the second part which is finding out

586
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,009
what these compounds are good for and

587
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,319
how they can really impact human health

588
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,388
for meaningful

589
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,769
and so with that thanks for your

590
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:45,849
attention and happy to take some

591
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:47,618
questions oh that is absolutely

592
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:49,618
fascinating work I love seeing the the

593
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:51,759
adjustments on the panel transferases

594
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:53,439
I'm trying to get a gauge of the

595
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,769
relative efficiencies next to cannabis

596
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,659
and obviously you're using sugar and and

597
00:21:56,769 --> 00:22:00,190
99 percent of the sugar in the world is

598
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,740
made by the Calvin cycle and

599
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,480
photosynthesis and so why rip out the

600
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,700
middleman there and are you getting

601
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,470
close to the efficiencies and the carbon

602
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,499
audits that that make this type of

603
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:14,048
activity economically feasible yeah I

604
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:15,399
think yeah I don't want to knock the

605
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:15,819
plant I hope it didn't come off like

606
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:17,498
that

607
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:19,298
I think it's mostly that the cannabis

608
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:21,069
plant has a number of responsibilities

609
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:22,480
so I can't get into specific numbers on

610
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:24,189
where we're at right now but I would say

611
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,980
the cannabis plant is doing all sorts of

612
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,200
things if its sole job was to convert

613
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,169
the sunlight into cannabinoids it would

614
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,149
it would kick our ass but it is doing

615
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:36,249
all sorts of things as a plant needs to

616
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:38,798
and so I think that really what we do is

617
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:40,749
we take a single slice of all the

618
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,359
metabolism that plant is doing put it

619
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:45,368
into yeast feed them sugar just run them

620
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,349
at full speed and and get the process

621
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:48,939
done in one to two weeks and so I think

622
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:53,859
that's where the competitiveness comes

623
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:56,169
in could you comment on the regulatory

624
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:57,668
structure which licenses you need and

625
00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:00,190
then which labeling would go on the

626
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:02,590
products using those ingredients I think

627
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,419
so regulatory is something we understand

628
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,189
is is definitely very important and a

629
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:08,409
major challenge in this area I am not

630
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,788
qualified to tell you the answer to that

631
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:12,220
yet but it's definitely something we've

632
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,509
made central to our early development

633
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,808
effort we're not waiting until we have

634
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:17,889
the product to do it is it a DEA license

635
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:20,349
because it's not a plant

636
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:22,028
yeah so we're DEA license everything we

637
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:23,798
do is within federal law and it'll

638
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:25,839
always be that way but I think I mean

639
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:27,730
that that situation is kind of changing

640
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,509
rapidly and still defined right now so

641
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:35,089
we err on the side

642
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:36,829
caution there Thanks sure thanks for the

643
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:39,168
great talk you mentioned that you're in

644
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:41,418
the scale-up phase with you know scaling

645
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:43,549
up the amount of a product that you're

646
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,690
making I've seen in literature in the

647
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:46,250
past that there's issues with

648
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,690
cytotoxicity with some of the

649
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,980
cannabinoids that are produced at least

650
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,210
the terminal cannabinoids is that

651
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,429
something you've addressed yet in

652
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,840
scalability or have seen one way or the

653
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:55,370
other

654
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:57,109
yeah so it's it's interesting in

655
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:58,459
metabolic engineering I've heard this

656
00:23:57,109 --> 00:24:00,048
for a number of products and there are

657
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,048
some cases where the products were truly

658
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:04,970
toxic and in other cases it just has to

659
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:06,829
do with miss balancing the metabolic

660
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,029
pathway and so I can't get into detail

661
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:09,798
but I'd say we think it's the latter

662
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,569
we're not we're not overly concerned

663
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:18,529
about the toxicity of these compounds to

664
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:20,429
east excellent thank you yeah all right

665
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,710
great thank you

666
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,180
[Music]

667
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:33,640
[Applause]

668
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:33,640
I think we have one more question early

669
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:44,839
what's the healed of the product we are

670
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:51,829
making yeah I can't I can't tell you

671
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:54,558
that right now I'm sorry yeah yeah just

672
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:57,589
curious when can you give us any sense

673
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:01,519
of when this technology might come

674
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:03,949
online and be a competitive threat to

675
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:08,119
the traditional art of growing marijuana

676
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:10,730
and cannabinoids yes I think first this

677
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,049
is going to be a massive ecosystem and I

678
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,140
don't think that what I described here

679
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:16,099
today is ever going to be a threat to

680
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,660
you know large number of people that

681
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,879
want to interact directly with the plant

682
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,040
that's a different experience I think

683
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,370
that we could be a threat to rare

684
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:26,779
cannabinoids pretty quickly and I but I

685
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:28,459
don't I don't view it as a threat you

686
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:30,558
would more as a bonus because there just

687
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,259
isn't a good way to scale those right

688
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,079
now

689
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:37,339
but yeah I don't know exactly I'm more

690
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,009
on the science side I don't know exactly

691
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:42,769
how much I'm allowed to say about our

692
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:44,329
scale-up timeline but it's it's what

693
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:47,269
we're working on right now essentially

694
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:50,689
so so we just one of the questions terms

695
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:53,750
of relatively quickly for rare

696
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:56,179
cannabinoids are we talking 12 months we

697
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,829
talking five years seven years type of

698
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,570
thing is there any type of time frame

699
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:03,039
less than definitely less than five

700
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:03,039
years yeah okay

701
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,259
do you know or is it known what it is

702
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:18,519
about cannabinoids that are toxic to

703
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:20,410
uced yes so I actually don't think

704
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:22,389
they're that toxic to yeast and so I

705
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:25,450
have seen those reports I think that I

706
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,100
think that that's a hard question to

707
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,660
answer I mean you can I guess you could

708
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:31,869
add the misogynist lead to a yeast

709
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,580
culture and maybe see toxicity but you

710
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:36,129
know they're not very soluble compounds

711
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:38,079
so there's questions there I think that

712
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:41,910
producing cannabinoids can be toxic

713
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:44,460
perhaps even if the final yeah yeah

714
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:47,200
[Applause]

715
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,000
yeah I I gotta just fall back on kind of

716
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,890
a variation on my last answer which is

717
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,690
that you need to get everything lined up

718
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:56,110
right going back to that assembly line

719
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,630
analogy I think of the I Love Lucy part

720
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:59,709
where she's on the the conveyor belt

721
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,150
with the chocolates and they're

722
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,950
basically coming in too fast and

723
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,420
starting to spill over so a metabolic

724
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,340
engineering when you end up in that

725
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,920
situation that's spillover instead of

726
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:10,178
being chocolate is usually toxic so it's

727
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,710
it's that kind of thing where you just

728
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:19,600
basically need to get things balanced

729
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:22,779
correctly so if somebody had 30

730
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,659
cannabinoids and they wanted to go into

731
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:27,220
the FDA with a plan and we wanted to

732
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,950
start a master drug Wow

733
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,870
how saying could you do that I think it

734
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,730
depends on on which cannabinoids there

735
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:36,189
were I think that our technology is

736
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,589
particularly amenable to certain kinds

737
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,320
of variants I think that you know we

738
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:42,789
should have access to in principle the

739
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,409
full range of cannabinoids from the

740
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:46,119
plant but I'd say I basically would need

741
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:49,320
to see the compounds to give an estimate

742
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,319
for some it could be very quick

743
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:59,400
all right thank you

744
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:59,399
[Applause]
