kimless Deb has been in the medical

33
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:43,759
cannabis field since 2013 where her

34
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,118
diverse involvement spans many areas

35
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,399
including cannabis cultivation

36
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:52,840
processing formulation testing patient

37
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,599
care and conducting research she

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,719
consults within the industry as an

39
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,919
adviser for companies who are interested

40
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,438
in novel formulations specific to

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,599
medical conditions

42
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:06,398
she develops protocols obtains IRB

43
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:10,519
approval conducts clinical trials and

44
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,000
helps publish the results at Kim at 24

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,360
Deb presented a poster that shared data

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,479
from an open label clinical trial

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,519
investigating the use of a cannabinoid

48
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:24,039
enhanced topical cream to alleviate

49
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,519
symptoms of restless leg syndrome RLS is

50
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:30,318
a condition that affects up to 10% of

51
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:33,360
the US population including Deb herself

52
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,679
she found relief using a cbda based

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,120
topical cream and is working with the

54
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,080
product manufacturer to conduct clinical

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,480
trials that demonstrate its

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,599
Effectiveness during our conversation we

57
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:50,479
discuss the symptoms of RLS and possible

58
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,919
causes Deb's own struggles with the

59
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,318
condition why many conventional and

60
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:59,238
pharmaceutical treatments for RLS fall

61
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:01,439
short why cbda appears to be an

62
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,599
effective treatment

63
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,120
why a transdermal approach is better

64
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,839
than ingesting or inhaling

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,519
canabo and Deb shares results from that

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,598
open label clinical trial including some

67
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,239
pretty remarkable success

68
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,598
stories before we get to my conversation

69
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,200

[Music]

86
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:19,719
good morning Deb thanks so much for

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,399
joining us on the podcast yet again good

88
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,880
morning thanks for having me of course

89
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,120
all right so I'm excited to talk with

90
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,399
you today about restless leg syndrome

91
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
you had a poster at CED 24 that

92
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,239
presented presented data from an open

93
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,560
label clinical trial that looked at

94
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,079
using a cannabinoid enhanced topical

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,319
cream for alleviating Restless like

96
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:44,599
syndrome which I know we're going to

97
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,319
dive into but before we do that I was

98
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,320
hoping could you tell us a bit about

99
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,599
your background and how you became

100
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,639
interested in investigating using

101
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,439
cannabis to treat restless leg

102
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,079
syndrome okay so it's a long story back

103
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:01,439
in 2013 I entered into the Cannabis

104
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:04,639
space by just being really inquisitive

105
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:08,120
learning about medical cannabis as a

106
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,478
method of treating a whole host of uh

107
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,360
diseases and medical conditions through

108
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:16,639
this process I had myself in many

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,080
different touch points including an

110
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,639
owner operator of a company that

111
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,359
cultivated and processed cannabis

112
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,519
products for patients in the medical

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Market as well as um guiding patients in

114
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,240
the treatment and use of cannabis for

115
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,360
whatever conditions they are struggling

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,280
with and now I've sort of evolved into

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,240
conducting research for companies whose

118
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:44,719
passion is to Rise Above The Fray and

119
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,840
distinguish themselves by actually um

120
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,600
looking at a particular method of

121
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,560
administration or form factor and

122
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,080
applying it to a certain disease process

123
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,519
and seeing if it works or not and

124
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:01,599
so that's how I got into the Cannabis

125
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:04,680
space and that's sort of my 11 year uh

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,759
Journey but the reason why I chose

127
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:12,680
restless leg is because I have it oh wow

128
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:17,840
and so uh I've had it now since

129
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,680
2006 and it's uh a weird strange

130
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,918
condition and I've you know subsequently

131
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,478
learned that actually it's pretty common

132
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:28,240
neurologic condition affecting upwards

133
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:30,199
of 15% of the general population which

134
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,759
is a pretty large

135
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,280
number and the issue is with it like

136
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,960
many disease processes there's not one

137
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:42,478
causitive factor mine came on after my

138
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,799
breast cancer surgery and they actually

139
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,639
treated me for um with postop pay meds

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,800
for a prolonged period of time because I

141
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,400
developed a neuropathic pain syndrome

142
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,840
and then I got off this med and then I

143
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,679
ended up with restless

144
00:06:53,839 --> 00:07:00,159
leg and I've been tried on a whole host

145
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,720
of different pharmacologic Therapeutics

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,560
and there are um a bunch of different

147
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,120
ones that are either off Lael utilized

148
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,639
or on label utilized and the different

149
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,840
categories are anywhere from Gaba

150
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:18,680
analoges like Gaba pentin to

151
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:22,000
dopaminergic type drugs to adenosine to

152
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,319
even uh iron supplementation because

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,598
iron deficiency can also cause this none

154
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:31,598
of those improve my symptoms and it was

155
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:34,560
and has been incredibly

156
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,839
annoying the interesting thing about

157
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,079
restless leg that's almost ubiquitous

158
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:43,719
when you talk to people is that the

159
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:46,158
treatment that is most efficacious is

160
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,199
getting up and stretching your legs and

161
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:51,719
walking around now unfortunately that

162
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,520
disturbs your sleep and that's the

163
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,039
culprit issue here because now you're

164
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,959
yes you're you're treating your restless

165
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,839
leg but you're sleep deprived and then

166
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,519
you're hold a shot the next day because

167
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,399
you're roaming around the house or

168
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:08,038
stretching your leg or uh you know

169
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,478
moving around so much or partner if you

170
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,560
have one in in in the bed with you is

171
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,120
like also sleep deprived and it's you

172
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,560
know so the whole household's disrupted

173
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,959
so how how many times would you be

174
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,639
getting up throughout the night like

175
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,638
many times like many many time like it's

176
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,199
interesting because when you first go to

177
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,800
sleep you're fine and then an hour

178
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,520
you'll wake up you'll stretch you'll

179
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,519
walk around go to the bathroom you get a

180
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:36,240
drink of water you go back to bed and

181
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:39,360
you hope that this will go away and then

182
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,560
it doesn't and even interestingly when

183
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:49,639
you utilize um an oral ingestible form

184
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:53,199
of canabo and I've tried many um sadly

185
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:57,120
it it didn't work really well or just

186
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,800
like all of the other traditional pH

187
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,360
pharmacotherapeutics it didn't work

188
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,958
reliably

189
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,600
so sometimes it would work and maybe it

190
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,679
was just out of sure exhaustion that I

191
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,278
would stay

192
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,919
asleep or maybe it did work but not

193
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,039
really I couldn't say well this

194
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,519
particular capsule or gummy or this or

195
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:18,639
that okay I'm fine and I'm I'm good to

196
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,159
go so it became a thought experiment for

197
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,799
me because I'm like well what's

198
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,480
interesting

199
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:29,439
is even though it's a neurologic issue

200
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,240
and and there's been studies looking at

201
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,519
Central neurologic issues so in cerebrum

202
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,399
spinal cord issues peripheral nerve um

203
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,200
which ubiquitous and consistent is that

204
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,200
people get up and stretch and move

205
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,000
around and so that's a peripheral

206
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,440
mechano

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,958
receptor and we've got a whole bunch of

208
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,399
different kinds of mechano receptors in

209
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:56,319
our body mechano receptors are these

210
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:59,839
little uh receptors in our in in our

211
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,000
body that allows us to feel temperature

212
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,160
changes prop reception so if you close

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,360
your eyes and you're standing you don't

214
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:09,278
fall on your nose your body is able to

215
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,879
adjust to where it is um without having

216
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:15,720
you fall and vibration so these are the

217
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,759
special types of receptors that do this

218
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,160
but here if I

219
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,480
stretch it kind of feels good SL hurts

220
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,799
and then I'm able to go back to sleep

221
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,000
and I'm like well what if we block um

222
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,559
The mechano receptors peripherally not

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,120
centrally

224
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:36,078
I wonder if that would work and then how

225
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,839
would we do that so I tried lots of

226
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,479
different topical over thec counter

227
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,800
stuff you know they've got

228
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,200
over-the-counter Ides they've got you

229
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:46,120
know over-the-counter magnesiums they've

230
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,360
got overthe counter

231
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,799
menthols um camper castor oil none of

232
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,360
that seemed to work and so I started

233
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,120
thinking about

234
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,159
cbda

235
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,879
because cbda is a very potent

236
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,719
anti-inflammatory

237
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,200
Baseline um we know that we know that it

238
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,639
works on a whole host of different types

239
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,040
of

240
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,639
receptors not CB1 or CB2 it can have a

241
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,480
one or two receptors that are either

242
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,039
Central peripheral but other kinds and I

243
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,039
started researching that it actually

244
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:27,399
works on uh trip A1

245
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:30,000
receptors and these Paso receptors and

246
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,958
they seem to be

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,200
intimately involved in stretch

248
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,399
receptors and so I'm like hm I wonder if

249
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,000
if that would

250
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:44,480
work and I applied a special formulation

251
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,519
of cbda and I'll get into that in a

252
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:52,200
little bit onto my legs and for the

253
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,600
first time in almost 20 years I was able

254
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,920
to sleep through the

255
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:01,440
night and I was blown away so I called

256
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:03,399
the owner of the company the PHD uh

257
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,040
scientist that formulated this

258
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:09,120
particular iteration and said let's run

259
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:13,519
this clinical trial because this is my

260
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,320
experience wow and now can you describe

261
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,519
what the like the symptoms feel like so

262
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,839
is it just like you have an urge to move

263
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,159
your legs this

264
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,800
unbelievable intense urge

265
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:29,240
annoying

266
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,078
pressure and I don't want to say cramp

267
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,919
because it's it some people do get

268
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,559
cramps I did not experience that it's

269
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:38,599
just this intense squeezy pressure that

270
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:40,198
you just have to get up and do toe lifts

271
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,920
and just stretch out for me it's my

272
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:43,519
calves other people have other

273
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,799
manifestations some people have it in

274
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,560
their entire leg some people have

275
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,759
restless leg even though it's a misnomer

276
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,239
for them in their arms where they just

277
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,198
have to get up and just stretch their

278
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:58,000
arms all the

279
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:59,838
time I met up with one patient who wore

280
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,839
out the sheet

281
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,000
on the bottom of her bed from

282
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,360
continually stretching like literal

283
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
holes in her

284
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,919
sheets no and and you mentioned that the

285
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:16,479
relief is in a lot of cases getting up

286
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,599
moving stretching I have to imagine that

287
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,120
for um older people or maybe people who

288
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,680
aren't as mobile that's not really an

289
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,440
option so that must be difficult well

290
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,078
then what happens like sometimes I'm

291
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:33,000
super exhausted I just flex and extend

292
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:36,479
end my my feet to stretch my

293
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,198
calves but as you aptly put I mean one

294
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,159
that's not 100% efficacious and two as

295
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,719
an older person if they're on any other

296
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,360
medications or they have mobility issues

297
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,278
or stability issues or just waking up

298
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,360
from a sound sleep you get disoriented

299
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,639
you know could lead to Falls or other

300
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,120
injury so and you're exhausted I mean

301
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,440
you're you're literally you know super

302
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,320
sleep deprived yeah

303
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,720
and did I understand correctly when you

304
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,040
were kind of investigating different

305
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,160
treatments for this it wasn't so much

306
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,879
like

307
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:12,679
stimulating um that stretch um or

308
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,519
mimicking sort of that stimulation of

309
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,638
the stretch receptors it's actually

310
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,440
blocking

311
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:22,159
those well I think the goal of the

312
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,240
traditional therapeutic is to try to

313
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,799
block from either Central spinal cord

314
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,759
conduction mhm you know so they're

315
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:34,078
looking working on Gaba dopamine and and

316
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,639
those types of things or iron for some

317
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:39,439
reason you know you see a lot of

318
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,000
pregnant women who complain of um

319
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,519
restless leg during

320
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,320
pregnancy but interestingly even after

321
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,360
you correct for their iron

322
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,320
deficiency often times their restless

323
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,000
leg Still Remains so I don't know if

324
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,879
it's true true and unrelated or truly

325
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
causitive nobody really has defined it

326
00:14:53,879 --> 00:15:00,799
and there's not a lot of research out

327
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:03,480
there on this but um anytime you take a

328
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:07,159
centrally acting pharmaceutical there

329
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,639
are centrally acting adverse effects

330
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:13,439
including you know sance balance issues

331
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,680
you know a whole host of other side

332
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,160
effects which I prefer and I'm very

333
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,638
sensitive to all kinds of

334
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:23,319
pharmaceuticals so the idea of a

335
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:27,600
topically applied therapy to me made

336
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,120
sense yeah so now is so is the idea with

337
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,920
those other Therapeutics you short

338
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,919
trying to block that signal from the

339
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:38,479
legs to the brain saying like we need to

340
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:42,078
move try to cut that off oh it was it's

341
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,120
blocking blocking some kind of a barent

342
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,758
signal from the brain transmitted

343
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,039
peripheral interesting okay so it's the

344
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,720
other way it's top down right start

345
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,679
stopping that here we're just trying to

346
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,278
block whatever's being apparently

347
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,519
transmitted because that's what it is

348
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:01,318
it's it's weird wrong signals not unlike

349
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,360
Nur I pain which is you no longer have a

350
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:05,479
pain there's nothing causing your pain

351
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,600
but yet you still have

352
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:13,519
it okay all right that makes sense so so

353
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,000
what is it about cannabis or you know

354
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:21,600
cbda that kind of makes it an effective

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,799
treatment here so THC thca CBD cbda all

356
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,759
of the cannaboids work on many different

357
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,758
types of

358
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:30,399
receptors um including the trip a1s the

359
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,839
nice thing about CB C BD and

360
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,240
cbda is that at least for now in the

361
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,639
current legal landscape you don't have

362
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,278
to jump through as many Hoops as you

363
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,919
would if you were going to experiment or

364
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:48,000
use THC or even thca at this point um so

365
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,399
you're walking a fine line the second

366
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
thing about um this particular

367
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,480
formulation of

368
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,519
cbda is that it's about 75% cbda about

369
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,159
5% CB

370
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,359
so we're working with both both of those

371
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,558
but it's formulated in a way that is

372
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,438
very special it's complexed with a metal

373
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:12,279
called

374
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:17,000
magnesium and it is formulated so that

375
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:20,798
it has both um hydrophilicity it likes

376
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,318
water and lipophilicity it likes fat and

377
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:29,200
it allows for penetration through our

378
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:31,079
skin which makes it uh available to the

379
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,919
deeper tissue the deeper receptors

380
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:36,720
within the dermis which is where these

381
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:40,200
mechano receptors reside so I didn't

382
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,519
experiment with just cbda or just CBD

383
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,440
actually regular CBD I've I've tried and

384
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:48,359
didn't work but just

385
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,519
cbda um without this special

386
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,678
formulation to see if it would work or

387
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,158
not I would probably venture to say

388
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,919
probably not as well because this

389
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,840
particular formulation from this company

390
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,720
that's their secret SCE sauce it allows

391
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:05,399
for this dermal

392
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,600
penetration of um these canabo to allow

393
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,280
it to work it's

394
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,839
magic and the topical application like

395
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:15,599
you said before better than oral because

396
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:18,599
it's more localized or well when it's

397
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:21,279
more localized it's more bioavailable so

398
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,439
anytime you you ingest anything it goes

399
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,639
through the metabolic process and so

400
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,159
even if you have X amount of milligrams

401
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,200
of whatever canono when once it goes

402
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:34,039
through that digestive process and gets

403
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,640
metabolized you know you've got a a

404
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:40,679
lesser amount available plus it's

405
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,840
distributed throughout your entire body

406
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,559
and here it's local to the area where

407
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,599
your mechanical receptors or

408
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:51,440
peripherally that you're trying to block

409
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:53,119
right so same with then with inhalation

410
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,320
you you're you'd be bypassing the

411
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,798
digestive but again like you said it' be

412
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,480
distributed throughout the whole body

413
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:02,038
and not be as effective EX exactly and

414
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,519
then with cbda because I believe that

415
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:08,319
that is way more efficacious than CBD if

416
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,639
you're heating it as an inhalation

417
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,639
either through smoking or vaporizing

418
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,360
you're converting it right so the amount

419
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,960
of cbda you're getting is is is much

420
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,918
much less than what is being applied and

421
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,159
available um topically so that's a

422
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,799
challenge so unless they create a

423
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:29,600
vaporizer of CBD a you know that

424
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:32,279
maintains that so it's a cold Vapor or a

425
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,158
method of inhaling but again you'd have

426
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:38,599
to worry about that volume of

427
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:42,240
distribution with within our body um you

428
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:44,719
know it's hard and you know again how

429
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,679
wonderful and accessible is it that you

430
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,240
are applying it locally the adverse

431
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,360
effects are di

432
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,400
Minimus you know I'm guessing you know

433
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,959
and I'll discuss the the the the small

434
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,440
trial that we conducted um but no nobody

435
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,240
had any issue you know I guess the only

436
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,798
thing that that I could think of would

437
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,720
be a skin irritation from any of the

438
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:12,440
excipients from the you know from from

439
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,600
the uh shea butter that is the base

440
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,400
which is pretty

441
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:20,639
neutral yeah so yeah let's get into sort

442
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,919
of the results from the the trial um so

443
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,679
knowing what I just said you know the

444
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,440
bioavailability the topical application

445
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,759
the

446
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,120
penetration of of this I'm like well

447
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:33,679
can't be the only one that you know is

448
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,158
experiencing this and one other thing

449
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,559
remember we're not unfortunately not

450
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,320
curing

451
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:42,000
anything you know because those a baren

452
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,200
signals continue I'm sort of hopeful

453
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
that maybe if I continue to block them

454
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,640
purly maybe you know that signal that

455
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,679
circus signaling will go away but thus

456
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,600
far it hasn't for me at least and for

457
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,679
the the 10 people I've trialed it on so

458
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:01,399
I put out actually on social media hey

459
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:04,840
hey anybody with restless leg give me a

460
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:09,080
buzz I've got this topical application

461
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:11,519
that may work for you and so I received

462
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:15,720
a bunch of different people who

463
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:18,319
contacted me and the premise was is that

464
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,839
there is a international restless leg

465
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:26,000
syndrome validated questionnaire there's

466
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:27,759
11 questions plus I did a um uh patients

467
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,079
Global impression of change which looks

468
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:33,839
at quality of life pre and post

469
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:36,678
treatment and we used those two

470
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:40,519
measurements real quick just to see if

471
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:43,038
if how people responded and again you

472
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,720
either know it or you don't know it it's

473
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,919
not like you have to build this up to

474
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,919
see if it works although I did run the

475
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,840
trial for two weeks just to see what

476
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:56,600
other people's experiences would be so

477
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:59,199
we um had a on the on the irls validated

478
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:02,038
questionnaire you had to have a less leg

479
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,278
score of a seven or

480
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:09,480
greater so at out of a scale of 0 to 10

481
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:12,119
and that was the the minimum inclusion

482
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,960
criteria for you to have that to come in

483
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,639
you could actually still be on a a

484
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,240
pharmacologic therapeutic because if

485
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,960
you're seven or grer clearly it's not

486
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,159
working yeah I'm sorry what were you

487
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,558
gonna say so what are some of those

488
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:29,080
questions so how often do you get up how

489
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:32,278
long have you had this for you know how

490
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,918
much does it disrupt your evening how

491
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:38,519
much does it disrupt your day the

492
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:42,360
following day you know how much does it

493
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:45,319
disrupt um your ability to live your

494
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,399
life I mean it's it's uh pretty

495
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:50,278
significant stuff how often do you get

496
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,120
up how long do these sessions last so in

497
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:56,159
a 24-hour period are you up and running

498
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,959
around at night you know for three hours

499
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,640
four hours wow yeah

500
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,440
so those people are really

501
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,000
struggling yes we are I mean it's it you

502
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,440
know it sounds like oh restless leg no

503
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,359
big deal it's it's actually very

504
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,679
disruptive yeah I can remember the first

505
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,759
time I heard about it I mean I don't

506
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,360
know it must have been like a late night

507
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:20,200
infomercial type of therapeutic and I

508
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:22,959
was like Restless like what what even is

509
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,000
that but since I I've heard others

510
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,159
struggling with it my my grandmother

511
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,798
towards the end of her life um was

512
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:30,320
starting to struggle with that as well

513
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,200
and that's what made me think of you

514
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,519
know I mean she wasn't the most mobile

515
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,159
so that must have been really difficult

516
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,400
for her if if the urge is to get up and

517
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,880
start moving I can't even imagine it's

518
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,519
almost like having an itch you can't

519
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,320
scratch how crazy that must be you know

520
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,679
I'm lucky I can get up and move around

521
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,240
and I can't even imagine somebody who is

522
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,120
bedridden and you know or reduced

523
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,159
mobility and don't have doesn't have the

524
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:59,558
ability to at least try to solve the

525
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:06,080
problem it must be insanely frustrating

526
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:09,440
and disruptive so 10 people the average

527
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:12,678
um the average you know struggle for

528
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,159
restless leg was like eight plus on

529
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:19,400
these people so they they met and

530
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:23,600
exceeded that um that issue the seven or

531
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:26,320
greater and we tried them for for um two

532
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:29,199
weeks and then I gave the the

533
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:32,319
questionnaires again and then also the

534
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,798
pgic which is at the end comparing how

535
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:37,759
you feel today versus how you felt

536
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:40,960
before the before the clinical trial

537
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:44,319
began and not I mean the statistical

538
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,480
significance was insane now ourn was

539
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,599
small the number of people I recruited

540
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,558
was were only 10 the reason was it costs

541
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:55,519
money to run clinical trials and to give

542
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,359
out free medication and to you know make

543
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,599
these things and get a statistician to

544
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,719
do this I mean and and this is a you

545
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:07,959
know a small company funding this

546
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,600
um it was everybody responded there were

547
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,278
two people that um didn't have

548
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,359
statistical significance they had a

549
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:16,398
reduction but not statistical

550
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:20,839
significance everybody

551
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:25,798
else had an insane reduction in their

552
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:28,398
restless leg in fact there's a woman who

553
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:31,759
is a musician and she could never

554
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:36,158
perform sitting down her restless leg

555
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:38,879
occurred 247 oh wow not just at night

556
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,559
she could never sit and watch

557
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,399
television she could never sit and go to

558
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:47,440
a movie or a play or a

559
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:50,519
concert and when you saw her perform and

560
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,399
I've seen her perform she you know would

561
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,879
roam the the stage while singing in

562
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:55,759
perform and and playing guitar or

563
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,320
ukulele or banjo or whatever else she

564
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:03,278
was playing I mean I it was awful

565
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:07,158
and this particular topical has been

566
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:11,000
transformative for her W it has taken

567
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:14,559
her from uh a scale of 0 to 10 10 being

568
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,880
the worst you can ever be to a

569
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:21,240
zero and she's not the only one but she

570
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,840
is you know the most uh vociferous about

571
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,919
screaming from the rooftops how

572
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:29,480
incredible this treatment has been for

573
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,720
her how life affirming and life changing

574
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,360
because she was getting depressed she

575
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,839
was going to neurologist after

576
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,119
neurologist after neurologist trying a

577
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:42,439
whole host of medicines that just either

578
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:45,558
knocked her out or made her feel even

579
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,278
more depressed or

580
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:50,678
suicidal and had to get off all of these

581
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:53,240
other crazy medicines which by the way

582
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,120
made her depressed or somnolent but

583
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,720
didn't take didn't take care of the

584
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:00,199
Restless Leg just made her even more

585
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,919
sleepy than she was before from being

586
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,558
sleep deprived do you get all the all

587
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:06,880
the drawbacks of the side effects and

588
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,839
not the benefits of the effects exactly

589
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,120
and this is a story that I heard from

590
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:16,359
the other nine patients in fact every

591
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,119
single person that was on a medicine got

592
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,798
off

593
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,319
it once they started the once the after

594
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,278
the two week trial when they were like

595
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:26,319
oh my God this cream really works

596
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,679
they've all weaned themselves off it

597
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,879
w and so how

598
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,640
is it just one application before bed

599
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,440
and you're and you're good or so

600
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,520
everybody's different and everybody's

601
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,038
symptoms are different the beauty of

602
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,278
this is that the systemic uptake of this

603
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,679
even though it does penetrate dermally

604
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,278
this the systemic uptake is a Dem

605
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,080
Minimus so you don't have to worry about

606
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:50,798
you know cytochrome p450 issues or you

607
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,359
know worrying about other medications

608
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:56,359
that you're taking and and the

609
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:59,319
metabolism thereof so what I recommend

610
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:02,918
to people is apply 30 to 45 minutes

611
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:05,439
before bed rub it in really well to the

612
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,600
affected areas again some people had

613
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,038
restless leg but it was just their

614
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:14,439
knees some people had Restless feet

615
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,960
syndrome it was just their feet mine is

616
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,679
just the back of my it's just my

617
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,360
calves and no other part of my leg so

618
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,120
rub that area the affected area I always

619
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,639
tell them less is more so because it's

620
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:30,000
if you're layering it on thick you're

621
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,640
just wasting you know the you know the

622
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,880
the topical so you put on until you rub

623
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,278
it in really well and go to

624
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,760
bed and the case of this woman that I

625
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,480
spoke about like whenever she wanted to

626
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,558
watch a TV show or a movie or a concert

627
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,240
put it

628
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,639
on right before you do it and then she

629
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,919
was fine and she was able to watch

630
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,640
television she was able to like binge

631
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,720
watch Netflix which she has never seated

632
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,799
which she has never been able to

633
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,079
do yeah CU before she must have been

634
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,839
frustrating yeah cuz before she would be

635
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,599
just pacing the living room pacing

636
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:08,199
getting up moving around yeah it's

637
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:12,839
exhausting I mean this poor woman was

638
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,480
was really struggling so some people

639
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,959
myself included some nights and I don't

640
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,558
know why get up you know 3:00 4 in the

641
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,798
morning and you feel a little bit and I

642
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,918
say

643
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:28,119
reapply and so I keep my little jar you

644
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,600
know on the countertop in the bathroom

645
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:32,038
and if I have to in the middle of the

646
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,759
night if I you know use the bathroom get

647
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:38,720
up put a little bit more on my hand

648
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:41,319
massage my leg and go back to bed and it

649
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,399
works and so now you mentioned this

650
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,359
isn't this isn't a your product or

651
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:47,959
anything it's one that you found was it

652
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,879
developed for this purpose or was it

653
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,480
something that you kind of locked into

654
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,640
no it's something again that I just

655
00:29:51,480 --> 00:30:00,240
started thinking about

656
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:01,559
cbda is an amazing molecule cbda a is

657
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,359
anything you know there's a song

658
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:06,918
Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better

659
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,798
anything CBD can do I believe cbda can

660
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,720
do

661
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:14,558
better and so it is a way better

662
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,679
anti-inflammatory it is specific on Cox

663
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:22,319
2 as opposed to Cox one and two which

664
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:25,038
CBD does both Cox 2 is mostly you know

665
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:29,200
uh inflammation which as a pain

666
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:31,879
reliever is fabulous and so this was

667
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,679
originally developed for pain relief for

668
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,919
topical pain relief better than volaran

669
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,519
better than steroid and because of its

670
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,880
anti-inflammatory nature I put it on

671
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:47,640
mosquito bites

672
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:52,000
rashes you know any type of like sunburn

673
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,600
it's it's incredible sunburn even

674
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,119
absolutely absolutely and it and it

675
00:30:54,599 --> 00:31:00,839
works beautifully but because of my

676
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:03,359
restless leg and my continued Research

677
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,759
into understanding how all of the

678
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,439
cannaboid molecules work you know

679
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,798
because I constantly researching this

680
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,200
when um I I bumped into an article that

681
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,000
talked about mechano receptors which I

682
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,200
was you know looking at huh which can

683
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,079
avonoids interact with mechano receptors

684
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,038
because a stretch receptor is a mechano

685
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,519
receptor I've got restless leg and

686
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:24,638
that's how that that was the rabbit hole

687
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,759
I jumped

688
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:30,199
down and then I'm like hm cbda I know

689
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,879
that this company because I use their

690
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,440
products for patients for pain

691
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,159
relief CU I I love cbda I think it's

692
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,120
it's fabulous and this particular

693
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,799
formulation penetrates right so I've got

694
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:46,398
people who've got low back pain from

695
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:49,960
muscular skeletal issues and all kinds

696
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:52,000
of stuff and I give it to them for that

697
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,440
and it works beautifully so now I'm like

698
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,519
well let's think about breastless leg as

699
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,440
a as a you know a a therapeutic

700
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,240
for this you know

701
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,600
indication and it worked I mean it

702
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,000
worked on me and then I did a you know a

703
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:12,558
quicky trial and so the goal now is

704
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,278
to publish this hopefully get some money

705
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:18,319
from you know either anyone out there

706
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,240
who's listening who wants to participate

707
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:24,119
and expand this clinical

708
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,519
trial Andor the NIH you know which we

709
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:28,319
will be applying for Grants but it's

710
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,558
interesting you know you just can't

711
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,158
apply for a grant with a big idea you

712
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,918
have to actually show some proof of

713
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,960
concept some inkling that it would work

714
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,799
um so go figure the government wants to

715
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,759
be responsible at this point so so you

716
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,798
know here I um I think now we at least

717
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,720
have a

718
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:51,000
signal right that there's an N of 11 me

719
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,600
and 10 other people where it actually

720
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,599
worked so you know it would you know

721
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:59,678
once we publish it we'll be able to then

722
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:02,839
make application and expand it to a um a

723
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,600
larger number of participants to see if

724
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:07,558
it truly works because I can't put my

725
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,439
nickle down and go see it works it's

726
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:13,398
efficacious I'm done because it's just

727
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,000
10 people right yeah but 10 diverse

728
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:19,599
people of different ages and backgrounds

729
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,558
and geolocations you know along the the

730
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:25,678
us but still it's only 10 yeah and I

731
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:28,319
would imagine different sort of

732
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,880
manifestations of of symptoms too right

733
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,839
you had that one example of the woman

734
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,559
who was sort of experiencing it all day

735
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:37,798
and others who might only at night or Y

736
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:39,918
things like that so and and that's the

737
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:44,158
beauty of this like think about it so

738
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:47,080
one it the the the cause of this is not

739
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,600
really well characterized and

740
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,879
multifactorial the symptoms of it

741
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:56,119
certainly multifactorial and when people

742
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:59,799
struggle with it and yet blocking at the

743
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:02,918
periphery and this so thus far is the

744
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:05,759
only uh therapeutic I've seen

745
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:08,320
specifically targeting at the

746
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,559
periphery you know think about then you

747
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,159
can who cares what the man the ideology

748
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:18,679
is I'm blocking it at the end organ

749
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:21,878
where the manifestation is and and it

750
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:24,000
works no and you mentioned too that I if

751
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:25,960
I heard you correctly it sort of started

752
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,199
happening after you had treatment for

753
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,720
for your breast cancer now is there

754
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:34,158
usually sort of like a a trigger or sort

755
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:37,158
of an event in people's lives where that

756
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,878
comes on it it could be I mean it's it's

757
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,838
not an uncommon thing so so after my

758
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,679
breast cancer I ended up with

759
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:46,119
neuropathic pain they tried me on a

760
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,559
whole host of different medications last

761
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,119
of which was a drug that they use like

762
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,759
water now called

763
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,399
Tramadol so trod all was initially

764
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:59,119
developed thinking it was just sitting

765
00:34:54,398 --> 00:35:02,239
on a opiate receptor the MU NE one

766
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,440
receptor um as a pain reliever but

767
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:08,679
didn't cause respiratory depression or

768
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,519
cardiac issues because it had a sealing

769
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:15,799
effect even if you escalated it that's

770
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:18,800
how it was built in the mid

771
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:23,519
2000s subsequently they learned that

772
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:27,920
this medication also sits on Gaba

773
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:30,119
receptors and serotonin receptors

774
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,960
and so when you get off it you're

775
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,880
getting off of three different

776
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,000
receptors and when you peel back that

777
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,200
layer after being on a drug for a period

778
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,679
of

779
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:44,598
time you know serotonin receptors gabber

780
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,480
receptors those are the ones that are

781
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,119
targeted therapeutic for restless leg

782
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,679
and here I did something to those

783
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:57,160
receptors I believe taking that

784
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:59,399
medicine that led me to this restless

785
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,879
leg I would imagine if I got back on

786
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,680
traad all which I would never do but I'm

787
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,079
imagining if I

788
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:09,000
did my restless leg symptoms may go away

789
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,760
oh interesting but I don't want to be on

790
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,838
that drug right right and that's why if

791
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,240
you think of what I said earlier you

792
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:19,639
know the gabber receptor the serotonin

793
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:21,879
receptor the dopamine receptors all of

794
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:23,440
those are what the pharmaceutical

795
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,880
companies are

796
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:30,440
targeting as a systemic drug

797
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,880
right so I I suppressed those receptors

798
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,079
with the medicine thinking I was helping

799
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,920
myself recognizing my neuropathic pain

800
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:42,119
wasn't going away took a year for me to

801
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,200
withdraw from this med was awful wow and

802
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,079
and I was left with restless

803
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:48,598
leg wow and now the neuropathic pain is

804
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:53,119
that something that you're treating with

805
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:56,760
canis cbda I keep that cream going and

806
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,800
and so I use it topically and it helps

807
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,240
alleviate it

808
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,920
dramatically excellent excellent um all

809
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,559
right d before I kind of get into like

810
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,358
the the closing part sorry I just hit my

811
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:10,039
microphone I know you mentioned that you

812
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,639
have kind of geeky science notes and

813
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:13,838
stuff like that I want to make sure that

814
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:15,519
it we kind of touch on that stuff I

815
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:18,719
think we did I was the geeky science was

816
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:23,079
The mechano receptors the Paso receptors

817
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:25,838
that when this so the name of the the

818
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:31,400
magic sauce is CB is cbda but they call

819
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:36,039
it kyobo and kyobo is this mixture of

820
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:39,000
cbda CBD coordinated with magnesium to

821
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:42,679
make it amphet teric so or ampop fisic

822
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,880
which means it absorbs through in water

823
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:48,679
it can also absorb in fat the lipid

824
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,519
layers which allows for this

825
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:55,000
penetration it looks specifically at

826
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,920
these membranes so interestingly enough

827
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,358
you don't have to sit directly on a

828
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,039
receptor

829
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:04,719
in order for a receptor to be changed

830
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:07,679
you can change the

831
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:10,480
membrane within which the receptor is

832
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,118
seated so change that confirmation or

833
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,599
that shape of that

834
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,640
membrane and therefore it changes the

835
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:19,359
ability of that receptor to respond

836
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,199
properly and I liken it to this you're

837
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,400
in a

838
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:27,000
pool and you're hanging out on a on on

839
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,079
on a on a floaty thing you know an inner

840
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,719
tube

841
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,200
okay and picture the inner tube to be

842
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:34,279
that you know like that

843
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:36,598
receptor and you're like something

844
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,359
hanging on that receptor and then you've

845
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,240
got this guy on the diving board that

846
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,838
just does a

847
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:47,239
cannonball and it causes this huge wave

848
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:51,880
now he didn't hit me but he caused a

849
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:54,159
huge change in the water that bounces me

850
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,358
off that

851
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:01,559
tube that's kind of how cbda

852
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:03,119
regarding the peripheral pazo receptors

853
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,119
and some of the other mechano receptors

854
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,920
work it's not sitting directly on that

855
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,838
receptor that we know of yet again we

856
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,838
don't have we have so much more research

857
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:12,960
to to Really parse out but the

858
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:14,759
hypothesis is is that we're changing

859
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,280
this sort of confirmation of the

860
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,560
membrane which in turn is changing the

861
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,680
receptor's ability to receive these

862
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,759
signals wow so that's my geeky

863
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,719
hypothesis I like that that's a nice

864
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,440
analogy

865
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:33,439
all right de so winding down here um I

866
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,000
wanted to kind of just ask you um what

867
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,119
advice you'd give someone who's maybe

868
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,519
considering using cannabis as a

869
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,760
treatment for restless leg so I would

870
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:50,559
say go on to a website called kylo

871
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:52,440
relief.com and kylo is c h y l relief R

872
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,920
lf.com

873
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,800
and try it get a small bottle use uh the

874
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,760
the lab laender and I like the lavender

875
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,039
one because it smells good smells like

876
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,800
lavender as opposed to canono some

877
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:10,358
people are put off by the scent of the

878
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,760
plant um by the way this is a an extract

879
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:15,159
from from the plant from the the plant

880
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,000
is it grows in nature these are not

881
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:20,920
canabo synthetically derived oh

882
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,880
interesting so for the purist out there

883
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,119
you know just know that you know there's

884
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,519
some turpine so it does have a canabo e

885
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,318
smell

886
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:34,880
um lavender I it also has LOLOL in it

887
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,838
which is a tpine and I'm all about you

888
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,400
know the Entourage effects so now you've

889
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:44,400
got cbda CBD you've got other tping in

890
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,280
it plus uh it's supplemented with with

891
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,318
lavender which has linol oil which is a

892
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,440
no muscle relaxing as well and try it

893
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:56,119
and you can use canm

894
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,679
20 in the coupon code and get 20% off

895
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,760
for any of you listeners out there that

896
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:05,719
want to try it I would ask to reach out

897
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:08,079
to me and if you want to put my um email

898
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:10,639
into you know the chat or whatever what

899
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,640
people listen to reach out to me and let

900
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:15,318
me know how you make out I would love

901
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:17,358
love love to use you know all of the

902
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:20,838
information from other people's

903
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:22,559
experiences as an observational study

904
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:24,119
excellent yeah I'll definitely put those

905
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,559
links in the show description so people

906
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,480
can easily find it um is there any other

907
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:33,239
sort of resources or

908
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,358
um resources available that we might be

909
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:36,598
able to point people to if they're

910
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:40,119
interested in learning more so on the

911
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:43,280
kylo relief website there is a Blog

912
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:45,400
section that goes in depth into the

913
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,280
geeky science that I sort of described

914
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,400
here regarding the receptors we

915
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,480
published we put up a white paper as to

916
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,039
our hypothesis as to how it works so

917
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,480
that would be a good resource and then I

918
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,039
will share with you one it the

919
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,800
publication is out and published and

920
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:05,000
they can read the official

921
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,200
publication um and then hopefully we'll

922
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,318
get some money in and be able to

923
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,559
continue to run these trials and there's

924
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:14,318
so many things we want to look at I mean

925
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:17,119
so one expanding our end of course and

926
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:20,679
two really parsing out our mechanism of

927
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,599
action to prove what we hypothesize

928
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:24,598
which is it truly is a peripheral

929
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:28,000
mechano receptor probably either the

930
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,359
trip a1s or the pasos or both

931
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,880
um and and how it works and we've

932
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:37,679
already been in conversation with a

933
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:40,960
university that has a um skin model that

934
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:43,440
allows to examine translocation and it

935
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,039
looks at as well looks at you know

936
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,480
different receptors so we just need

937
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:51,800
funding for that excellent all right um

938
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,960
well devb thanks so much again for doing

939
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,119
this um I'm so glad to to hear that

940
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,358
you've gotten some relief uh from your

941
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,280
condition and that you're helping others

942
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:02,679
um hopefully get some relief as well

943
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,800
thanks and thanks for giving me this

944
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:07,679
platform to share this knowledge because

945
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,480
it was great to present a poster at

946
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:14,078
camed in Marco Island this past May um

947
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,039
we got a huge amount of of of uh

948
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,640
interest people have been you know

949
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:20,800
purchasing it and reaching out to me and

950
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:24,078
telling me how transformative it truly

951
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,039
is and which I'm you know administering

952
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,640
the irls the that validated

953
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,480
questionnaire post

954
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,838
you know observation because people know

955
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,559
what they felt like and now they know

956
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,279
what they do and I will do that for

957
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,280
anybody else that you know wants to

958
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:40,160
participate in in in this as well but

959
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,440
I'm just excited that this is now going

960
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:46,279
to reach even further for people who are

961
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:49,200
listening to this podcast because um the

962
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:53,280
risk is low the benefit potentially is

963
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:57,719
great and my passion is to try to heal

964
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,720
the world so one can aboid at a time

965
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:03,279
yeah and it's great yeah cannabis really

966
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:05,598
is um it's really proving to be a great

967
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,240
therapeutic for sort of these sort of

968
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,519
edge cases or sort of difficult to treat

969
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:15,679
um conditions so um it's great

970
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:17,159
thing well as uh Dr Ethan Russo my

971
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:20,879
cousin says you know it's like a

972
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:23,519
pharmacy in a plant yeah and he's right

973
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,160
it's an efficient Pharmacy in a plant

974
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,679
absolutely all right Deb thanks again

975
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,799
and I hope to see you soon

976
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,799
appreciate it take care
