1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,480
i am excited to be here today to the

2
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:14,320
oh it's like 30 of you left

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,679
to talk about thcv and some plants that

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,320
we're developing that our high thcv

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,320
let's see

6
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:28,559
there we go so philos is a

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,320
crop science company we are developing

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:35,039
new cultivars and also seed grown plants

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,280
that are uniform and can be planted out

10
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,439
in a field or your greenhouse

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,640
not pheno hence seeds but ones that will

12
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,839
give you consistent results

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,799
and

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,000
we've

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,439
built

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,079
this program off of evaluations of tens

17
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,519
of thousands of cultivars we

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
have

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,359
great relationships with some legacy

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
breeders and have unlicensed some of

21
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,519
their varieties and pay royalties on

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,199
those varieties as we use them in

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,439
breeding

24
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,640
i think that's important to mention in

25
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,559
this

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
industry

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,280
we also have

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,960
a pretty big focus on minor cannabinoids

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,079
and trying to bring those into the

30
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:21,919
majors so that we can see high levels of

31
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:24,400
cbdv thcv and others

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,840
and we have a pretty

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,159
serious focus on uh

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,799
customer support for new

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
growers that have been growing all

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,400
different kinds of plants

37
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,319
at their farms before and are ready to

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,118
move into cannabis and so we're trying

39
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,719
to bring them into the world of growing

40
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,560
cannabis

41
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,560
so today i'm going to talk about

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,799
thcb

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
i think a lot of you are probably very

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,118
familiar with this cannabinoid but i

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,719
want to talk just a little bit about

46
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,280
what it looks like

47
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,640
so thc is on the left

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
very familiar

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
there are only

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,240
two different there are only two carbon

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,519
differences between

52
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:10,719
thc and thcp so it's just got a shorter

53
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,239
side chain than thc makes a pretty big

54
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,479
difference in how it interacts in the

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,959
body and what kinds of receptors it

56
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,039
binds to and and how it activates those

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,360
receptors

58
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,199
but they are very similar looking and

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
you'll see

60
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,878
in the pathway for creating these

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,439
cannabinoids they

62
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,719
go through exactly the same pathway same

63
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,598
enzymes

64
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,239
so

65
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,560
this slide actually i would say thcb is

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,759
a really promising cannabinoid i don't

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
know if it's the most promising

68
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,439
cannabinoid i mean cbdv is amazing you

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,319
saw talk about cbg today

70
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,519
for topicals and skin irritations i

71
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,079
think that there are so many

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,000
cannabinoids like ones that daddy mary

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
is talking about that no one even knows

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,680
about that have potential even at super

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,519
low doses for being important in medical

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,560
applications

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,400
so

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,959
correct that slide and say that it's

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,039
promising cannabinoid

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,519
so there have been a few

81
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,639
clinical trials there's been a fair

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,879
amount of pre-clinical work in

83
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,359
laboratory and

84
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,799
rodent models to look at the potential

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,800
of thcv

86
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,080
so

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,040
this is a listing of

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,640
papers that or studies clinical trials

89
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,639
that have shown positive

90
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,199
responses for different diseases or

91
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,518
afflictions there are some

92
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,000
that have negative results and i think

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,840
that the conclusion that i've come to is

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,719
that dosing is really important so we

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,400
need more studies more doses really

96
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,959
looking at what it takes to get an

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,200
effect and where this cannabinoid is

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,519
going to be useful so you can see that

99
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,079
there's evidence for anti-convulsant

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,158
activity could be useful for epilepsy

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,120
from a hill at all paper in 2010 um a

102
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,399
lot of people talk about thcv as being a

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
skinny weed

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,280
and

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,680
you know i think the jury's still out a

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,400
little bit but uh but there definitely

107
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,400
seems to be better control for

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,560
blood sugar

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,879
some other markers of diabetes insulin

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,798
sensitivity glucose tolerance and then

111
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,519
there is one study that shows that there

112
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,439
are appetite suppressant effects

113
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,039
although there are other studies that

114
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,959
show that there is not an appetite

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,680
suppressant effect

116
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,599
there is a study that shows that

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,319
there may be improved social and

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,520
cognitive behaviors in the schizophrenia

119
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,719
model

120
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,159
and then

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,840
also

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,720
improvements in neuropathic pain and

123
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,918
finally something that i think is really

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,199
incredible is that it's it's a potential

125
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,560
for

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,600
treatment of pd but also for

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,240
reducing disease progression so not just

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,680
symptoms but possibly important for

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,680
slowing that disease down

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
so

131
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,240
like i said

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,038
these are

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,639
a lot of pre-clinical trials very few

134
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,680
clinical trials

135
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,240
um some of the clinical trials have used

136
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,560
very small doses and i think that you

137
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
know like i said before dosing is very

138
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
important and we need to look at more

139
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,320
doses they're doing a clinical trial

140
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,720
right now just to look at safety and um

141
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,120
and tolerance for up to 200 milligram

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,280
doses so that'll set the stage for doing

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,000
clinical trials with more

144
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,119
levels more arms

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,959
and then

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,639
oftentimes in the rodent models or in

147
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,279
the cell-based systems they're using

148
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,439
really high doses

149
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,198
actually i list the casio

150
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,038
paper and that's a you know two

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,800
milligrams per kilogram which is not

152
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,680
super high for somebody like me that's a

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,759
60 milligram dose yeah it's kind of high

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,160
but some of them are like a 25 milligram

155
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,120
per kilogram dose and that's like 1500

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,120
milligrams of thcv i'm not

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
i'm not convinced that

158
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,160
that that's going to be realistic in a

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
human mode and a

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,639
human model in a human clinical trial so

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,879
i think that we need to do

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,280
more studies more clinical trials look

163
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,839
at different doses

164
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,318
um i think that there is a recreational

165
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,799
potential also for thcv

166
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,479
and we're doing a little

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,400
observational study right now to look at

168
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,599
responses to

169
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,318
being active or sedentary

170
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,400
to being

171
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,240
interested in food and you know what

172
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,439
your appetite is like and then looking

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,639
kind of at the

174
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,038
just a

175
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,560
a sense of joy and and how you're

176
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,680
enjoying

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,959
a particular product with an even ratio

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,639
one to one of thc and thcv so so we're

179
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,719
doing that it's small

180
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,960
but i think that we also need a lot more

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,599
observational studies to look at the

182
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,758
effects of thcv as a recreational

183
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,800
recreationally

184
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,800
important

185
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,919
cannabinoid

186
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
so

187
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,959
the problem with thcv though is that

188
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,840
it's it's typically found in really low

189
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,598
percentages there are reports of some

190
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,198
cultivars having up to about seven

191
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,680
percent thcv

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,598
when we went out and looked um at what

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,598
was out there we were seeing

194
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,598
i mean obviously you see many varieties

195
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,839
that have zero but for the ones that had

196
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,159
them in some level it was about a half a

197
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,879
percent to four percent so still pretty

198
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,039
small amounts and so if you want to make

199
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,800
a full spectrum extract and put it in

200
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,399
something some kind of an edible or

201
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,598
something like that

202
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,799
um

203
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,199
you're still looking at having to

204
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
produce a lot of biomass to get to that

205
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,960
level of

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,919
of extract that would be

207
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,680
viable as a product

208
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,839
so we would like to bring this

209
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,079
cannabinoid into the majors we think

210
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,079
that it is important for medical and

211
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,000
recreational applications

212
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:05,359
but what do you need to do that you

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,360
really need the trait to be heritable

214
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,000
you need to have natural variation for

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,680
the amount of thcv we do

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,240
marker assisted breeding but that's all

217
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,319
on natural variation

218
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,918
needed to not be phytotoxic when it goes

219
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,520
to higher levels and we need to

220
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,519
understand that chemical pathway that

221
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,680
goes from the precursors all the way

222
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,959
down to the cannabinoids so that we know

223
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,918
where to look for genes that are

224
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,399
important for making this cannabinoid

225
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,319
so i'll start with the

226
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,038
with the pathway so i'm starting at the

227
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,519
top kind of and so you have these two

228
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,679
precursor molecules butanoic acid and

229
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,399
hexanoic acid and those eventually get

230
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,399
down

231
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,879
all the way to the bottom

232
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,720
and you get your either pentyl

233
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,159
cannabinoids the ones that we talk about

234
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,080
a lot thc cbd cbc

235
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,240
or you get to the varins

236
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,800
and so they start either with the

237
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,240
hexanoic acid for the pentals or the

238
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,240
butinoic acid to get down to the varens

239
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,159
next step so they're using the same

240
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,080
enzymes to get there so they have these

241
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,919
different starter molecules

242
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
and then they're using acell activating

243
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,039
enzyme

244
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,880
with the different starter molecules to

245
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,958
get to the next step so you can see

246
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,480
already they have this difference in

247
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,159
this carbon tail

248
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,278
so right at the beginning you've already

249
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,838
got the difference that you're going to

250
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,838
see in the end

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,959
and then you add you know

252
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,240
another

253
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,958
molecule

254
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,600
to myelinal coas and you add two more

255
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,518
enzymes and they're these same enzymes

256
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,000
and so then you get to diverinolic acid

257
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,519
or all vitolic acid depending on which

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,519
starter molecule you had

259
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,079
final step

260
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,119
is gpp on a parental transferase

261
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,759
and

262
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,720
taking those down to get to i'd say the

263
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,159
mothers of all cannabinoids we have cb

264
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,000
cbgv

265
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,319
and cbg

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,958
and then that final step is you're using

267
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,040
these same three enzymes these same

268
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,759
cannabinoid enzymes to get to the final

269
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,159
products either the three variants or

270
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,480
the three cannabinoids and please i know

271
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,919
that i'm simplifying this a lot there

272
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,440
are probably

273
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,919
140 160 different cannabinoids that we

274
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,600
know of now i'm only talking about a few

275
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,519
of them but what i'm just trying to

276
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,920
illustrate here is that you know we

277
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,320
start with this these two different

278
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,559
molecules and then use all the same

279
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,920
components to get down to the bottom

280
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,919
so what happens to get to those first

281
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,679
bits that seem like they're the

282
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,838
important determinants of the kinds of

283
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,838
cannabinoids that you're going to make

284
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,880
we have to go all the way back up to the

285
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,079
fatty acid elongation process and i

286
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,799
don't want to go through this whole

287
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,039
thing but the important thing is is that

288
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:50,319
it's starting at these really base

289
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,240
molecules and for butanoic acid to get

290
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,440
to the varens it only goes through the

291
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,680
cycle one time so it only adds the two

292
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
carbons on the end but to get to

293
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,120
hexanoic acid to get to your standard

294
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,278
cannabinoids it goes through the cycle

295
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,720
one more time just to add two more so

296
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,879
every time it goes through the cycle it

297
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
adds two more carbons to the end

298
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,159
so

299
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,239
this part of the pathway which sits on

300
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,719
top of what i just showed you

301
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,320
is what's really important for making

302
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,320
those precursor molecules

303
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,399
so

304
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,759
bottom right there that understand the

305
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,440
chemical pathway i think we have a

306
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,000
pretty good handle on that it's some

307
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,360
really like low level stuff right this

308
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,360
is important stuff for the cells

309
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,959
and then for these other things that are

310
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,519
really important for us to bring this

311
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,479
cannabinoid into the majors

312
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,120
we see natural variation for thcv we've

313
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,839
seen it all the way from a range from

314
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,560
zero to about six percent

315
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,279
um in our hands we only had zero to four

316
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,879
percent to start with um we see it as a

317
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,439
heritable trait so when we look at a

318
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,360
family it segregates in the family so

319
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,320
you see some plants with none some with

320
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,240
a little bit and some with more and then

321
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,760
for phytotoxicity we're making some

322
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,959
assumptions here but we know that

323
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,799
cannabis

324
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,359
thc can go to

325
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:12,000
35 or more percent of the plant

326
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,320
by dry weight and is not phytotoxic so

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,440
we think that for thcv we'll have no

328
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,160
problem getting that to a higher level

329
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,200
so we use marker assisted breeding

330
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:25,278
we find genetic markers that are

331
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,720
associated with the trait

332
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:31,679
and then we can use that to

333
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,160
grow a lot more plants than we could by

334
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,078
standard methods so if we have these

335
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,559
markers that are associated with a trait

336
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,519
we can grow tiny little seedlings

337
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,838
in 0.2 square feet per

338
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,639
seedling plug instead of having two

339
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,040
square feet per mature plant

340
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,360
and we can get you know 50 times more

341
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:54,000
plants processed in that way than if we

342
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,278
had to grow them all to maturity so

343
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,519
probably telling you things you already

344
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,399
know but it allows us to go faster

345
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,200
because we can grow more plants

346
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
so

347
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
after we

348
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,920
have tested them then we're able to

349
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,399
select for those plants that are

350
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,078
predicted to have high levels of thcv

351
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,078
grow them to maturity and test them

352
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
so the first part of this

353
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,599
is discovery of the genetic markers and

354
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,759
this is an example just with

355
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,360
photosensitive and and day neutral

356
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,278
plants that i wanted to go through just

357
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,320
really briefly to kind of describe what

358
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,399
we're doing

359
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,879
but we take a plant that say is

360
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,159
photosensitive one that's day neutral we

361
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,639
cross those

362
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:37,439
the f1 plant there is heterozygous for

363
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,759
being photosensitive and day neutral and

364
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
then you

365
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,838
stealth that plant

366
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,879
all the chromosomes

367
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,519
get mixed up recombination happens and

368
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,278
you can look for plants that are

369
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,759
day neutral

370
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,679
and look at what genetic markers are

371
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,360
associated with that trait and so you

372
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,599
can see here we've got these two little

373
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,879
day neutral plants the little p little

374
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,120
peas and they both share a marker

375
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,679
that on both of their chromosomes that

376
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,039
allows them to be day neutral

377
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,638
all right so we're doing this with um

378
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,480
we have thcv

379
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,680
crossing a no thcv plant with

380
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,039
a plant that makes some thcv and then

381
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,599
selfing the f1 and same kind of thing

382
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,439
letting genetics do its work to help us

383
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,879
identify this association between the

384
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,880
phenotype and the genotype

385
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,399
all right so our first

386
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,120
shot at this

387
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,000
we i feel like we got kind of lucky so

388
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,600
this was a population of plants that did

389
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,799
not make very much thcb at all

390
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
initially

391
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,120
that wasn't even the point of doing this

392
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,159
of making this family but we made this

393
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,519
family

394
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,439
and it's segregated for having no thcb

395
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,560
versus having some

396
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,920
and

397
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:02,319
and we use qtl mapping on this family

398
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,719
first made a linkage map with all the

399
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,360
individuals and then we had cannabinoid

400
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,079
data on 142 of those so we were able to

401
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,720
make a qtl map we found one really

402
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,120
strong peak i was shocked i can't

403
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,519
didn't expect for this to happen

404
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
and so we started taking a look

405
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,440
at

406
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,920
some additional germplasm that we had

407
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,079
you can see that for the qtl map you get

408
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,479
you know with 142 individuals you have

409
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,799
this giant swath of a chromosome

410
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,839
hard to pin down exactly what's going on

411
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:37,198
so what we needed to do was to go into

412
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,399
additional germplasm and uh

413
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,958
and look for and use the plants

414
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,240
recombination to mix up all these

415
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,159
um

416
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
all the genetic information so that we

417
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,399
could really see what's associated with

418
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,278
the trait and so we had

419
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,679
302 accessions from 67 different seed

420
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,278
lots did nested association mapping

421
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,239
that's like a combination kind of

422
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,198
between

423
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,519
qtl mapping and genome-wide association

424
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,359
studies that's making use of family

425
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,278
information but it's also making use of

426
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,519
the fact that you have lots of

427
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,879
recombination between the different

428
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,000
families

429
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,759
and

430
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,919
of those they still had pretty low

431
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,879
levels of thcv

432
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,479
but we were able to confirm that spot on

433
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,919
chromosome 4

434
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,519
and um and could start to narrow down

435
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,919
what gene

436
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,560
was likely responsible and it turns out

437
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,319
it's a gene called kr or fab g

438
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,838
and um

439
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,040
it is

440
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,800
part of

441
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:41,838
this fatty acid elongation chain pathway

442
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,319
so we got really fortunate with

443
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,839
our populations even low levels we were

444
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,519
able to do this

445
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,040
low levels of thcv

446
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,519
and then

447
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,719
we were able to identify a gene that is

448
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,039
in the pathway very likely to be

449
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,920
the gene that is responsible for

450
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:05,438
having some production of of thcv

451
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,798
i should note that an australian group

452
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,279
uh also

453
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,480
reported on this at relatively the same

454
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,558
time and voila they found kr as well so

455
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,000
um two independent

456
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:20,480
groups finding uh the same gene

457
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,720
all right

458
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,720
so what do we know we know that

459
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,038
in order to produce

460
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:32,558
thcv or cbdv or cvgv for that matter all

461
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:35,359
the same precursor you need to have this

462
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:38,558
particular allele of the kr gene

463
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,639
and that you can have either one copy of

464
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,240
it or two copies

465
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,759
and then

466
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
you know we have very low levels of

467
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,200
variants but we know that they get much

468
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,279
higher so what explains much higher

469
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,160
levels besides just making more

470
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,918
cannabinoids well it must be other genes

471
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,000
so we knew that we needed to do more

472
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,280
work and so we

473
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,160
looked at

474
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,599
additional small families same kind of

475
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,360
process

476
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,599
we also had another f2 population

477
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,599
and

478
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:14,879
evaluated those in the same way

479
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,279
we also did have some african land race

480
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,320
seed lots that showed some segregation

481
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,879
for varanz which is

482
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,359
where we think that the initial

483
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,840
varanz were located was in

484
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,079
southern part of

485
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:33,119
africa so we did that and what we

486
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,918
required is that all of the plants had

487
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,798
kr the kr

488
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,200
allele that would allow for production

489
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,359
of varin and so we first restricted to

490
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,120
that so we knew that every plant should

491
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:49,678
produce some thcb or cbdb

492
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,639
but um what we wanted to get at were

493
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,640
additional genes that would elevate that

494
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,759
that cannabinoid and so we found um

495
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,160
genetic markers on five additional in

496
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,919
five additional locations chromosome one

497
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,360
four six and um two markers on seven

498
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,919
seven is where we typically find the

499
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,959
cannabinoid synthase genes although

500
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,559
different location on the genes

501
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,519
and

502
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,519
we had in some of our crosses two

503
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,679
accessions that were positive for the

504
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,440
markers that we found and they can't

505
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,240
contain between ten and a half and about

506
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,440
eleven and a half percent barrens

507
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,240
so that is good news

508
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,600
so

509
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,038
what are we doing we are um continuing

510
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,519
this

511
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:40,400
cultivar development of high

512
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,798
thcv and cbdv

513
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,080
plants

514
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,200
we

515
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,519
we have

516
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,160
done additional validation and

517
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,759
additional crosses and in our validation

518
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,600
we found that

519
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,919
one of the plants had all the markers it

520
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,279
looked so positive so promising and then

521
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,200
it only made four and a half percent

522
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,960
thcv so

523
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,880
it's clear and then

524
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,679
sort of another thing is that we had a

525
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,720
plant that made 14 thc

526
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,798
and so

527
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,240
and it only had four of the markers so

528
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,759
very clearly there's something else

529
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,079
going on there are other genes that are

530
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,279
important there's more work to do

531
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,480
um

532
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,319
we're continuing along this path and uh

533
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,400
and hope to to nail this down and be

534
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,639
able to share more updates as we find

535
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,640
them

536
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,158
so the next steps i kind of just

537
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,880
summarize that

538
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,640
we

539
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,480
expect six genes at least to be involved

540
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,960
in in this pathway

541
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,640
we think that they're involved in that

542
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,480
sort of upper part of the pathway where

543
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,240
you're making the precursors and it you

544
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,038
know makes different ratios of the

545
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,720
hexanoic tobu noic acid but then we also

546
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,480
think maybe that there's something in

547
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,798
the cannabinoid pathways where some of

548
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,679
those genes maybe have more affinity to

549
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,158
different

550
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,559
numbers of carbons in the side chains so

551
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,240
there's a lot more to learn

552
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,720
we have

553
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,440
an application that we

554
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,600
that's published for the genetic markers

555
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,480
and we're having to discuss licensing um

556
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,719
we're

557
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,599
continuing to develop plants that have

558
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,000
high levels of barren um just this last

559
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,839
cycle we got two more or three three

560
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,919
more that have pretty high levels of

561
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,038
varin two more fourteen percent plants

562
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,240
and another

563
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:26,798
uh one to one that's about 11

564
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,319
and the kind of cool thing is that even

565
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,480
though our variant levels aren't going

566
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,639
higher the flower quality is getting

567
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,480
better so a lot of the barren plants

568
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,759
that have been out there have been tough

569
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,519
to grow they're sprawly they're

570
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,759
they make a lot of flower but it's

571
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,599
larvae it's difficult to work with and

572
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,240
so we're getting to plants that look

573
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,038
more like cannabis plants that you might

574
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,599
want to produce from and so it's pretty

575
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,599
exciting

576
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,959
so i want to give full credit to the

577
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,600
team that did all of this work

578
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,519
you see there with the long blonde hair

579
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,480
and the the black shirt that's erica

580
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,200
bocker

581
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,798
um all of the computation all of the

582
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,679
statistics that's that's all her work um

583
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,319
she's

584
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,360
incredible and has really brought to

585
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,200
light

586
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,479
all kinds of incredible findings she's

587
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,640
our senior director of gene discovery

588
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,599
the breeding team the next three people

589
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,000
there john jarrod and becca jared czar

590
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,839
our director of breeding and john's our

591
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,359
vp and

592
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,558
you know they're directing a lot of the

593
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,798
work so that we get the crosses done and

594
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,480
making all those all those decisions

595
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,679
using the markers

596
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,679
and then amy on the far right

597
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,559
leads the cultivation team

598
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,559
and

599
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,558
without a solid cultivation team none of

600
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,000
this would happen grateful for them

601
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,798
every day

602
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,798
it's been great hearing all about

603
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,759
cultivation at this meeting and

604
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,240
nutrients and and just all kinds of the

605
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,319
stuff that i want to take back to them

606
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,120
um and then i also want to mention sarah

607
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:06,639
she is our chemist and directs the lab

608
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:09,199
and uh has been incredible to work with

609
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,280
on all of these different cannabinoids

610
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,519
and terpenes that we're studying

611
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,759
and so i want to give full credit

612
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,798
without this team none of it happens i'm

613
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,000
just the person up here talking

614
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,720
all right

615
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,200
i think that's it so happy to take

616
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,200
questions

617
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,240
hey

618
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,480
hi thank you very much for presenting um

619
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,640
i noticed that on the recreational slide

620
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,038
that you talked about thcv

621
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,559
that it mentioned the clear energizing

622
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:48,400
focused effects and one of the chemovars

623
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,839
that's very well known for having thcv

624
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,679
durbin poison

625
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,918
in its terpene profile its primary

626
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,320
terpene is terpenoline which also has

627
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,400
the exact same description of effects um

628
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,558
was that result was that including

629
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,038
terpenoline or was that thcv on its own

630
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,879
or how did that come about yeah so

631
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,919
that's a great question i didn't mention

632
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,600
the dominant cannabinoids in the plants

633
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,278
that that we've been looking at and um

634
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,918
actually

635
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,400
it's dominant in mercene which is not

636
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,559
great yeah it's trapinoline limonene and

637
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,440
mercin are the three dominant terpenes

638
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:26,440
for durban i believe yeah so ours is is

639
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,240
myrcene and osamine and

640
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,640
beta-caryophyllene so

641
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,120
wow you would not think uplifting

642
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,440
energizing at all and so that's another

643
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,719
focus of the program is to like put in

644
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,519
those energizing terpenes

645
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,519
okay yes

646
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:52,170
all right thank you so much

647
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:52,170
[Applause]
