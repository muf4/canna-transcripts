63
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,419
I played six years in the NFL four years

64
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:51,159
with the Jacksonville Jaguars two years

65
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,799
with the Chicago Bears as an offensive

66
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:56,348
lineman tackle guard and a little bit of

67
00:02:53,799 --> 00:03:00,280
tight end at the end just for starters

68
00:02:56,348 --> 00:03:03,209
I'm here to try to grab the year of the

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,688
NFL and start to look at cannabis as an

70
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:09,310
alternative to opiates and prescription

71
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:12,280
anti-inflammatories as well as what it

72
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:18,158
can be as a solution to concussions and

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:20,949
CTE hello my name is Nate Jackson I

74
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,739
played six years also in the NFL all for

75
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:26,259
the Denver Broncos I was a all right we

76
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:30,789
got some Bronco fans in the house there

77
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:34,149
we go no Bears fans our Jacksonville but

78
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:38,310
I played six years receiver okay okay we

79
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:41,459
got I was a receiver and tight end and

80
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,810
throughout my career I used cannabis as

81
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,639
medication to deal with the variety of

82
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,128
injuries that I had when I would get

83
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:50,169
hurt oftentimes a career I'm sorry a

84
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:52,209
season-ending injury they hand me a

85
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,009
bottle of pills I went home and instead

86
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,750
consume cannabis to deal with my

87
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:57,908
injuries and found that I healed much

88
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,848
faster than when I did it with pills and

89
00:03:57,908 --> 00:04:02,798
so it just got me thinking and after

90
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:04,568
retirement I started writing I am also a

91
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,459
writer I've written two books about my

92
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:07,988
experience in the NFL and I was honest

93
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,030
about the different medications that I

94
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,218
preferred and that's led me here because

95
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,019
I believe that football players current

96
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,728
and former need to arm themselves with

97
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:18,658
this information if they're going to be

98
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:18,658
able to stand up for themselves

99
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:30,430
everyone my name is Lance Johnstone play

100
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:42,810
eleven years six with Oakland and five

101
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:46,120
with the Minnesota Vikings I after a

102
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,000
retirement enough women as a broker at

103
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,389
Merrill Lynch from there I started doing

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,160
some angel investing adventures so

105
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:58,719
currently I'm we are part of an

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,290
accelerator for cannabis companies and

107
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,370
I'm here today to you know to continue

108
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:09,790
to help push awareness and you know as

109
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:12,639
you Cape helped educate not only some of

110
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,129
my fellow athletes but anyone that's

111
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,519
dealing with pain as in a turn on that

112
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:26,409
more natural alternative to you know

113
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:28,750
opioids so that's pretty much it so my

114
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,550
name is Ricky Williams and all you

115
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:35,199
Patriots fans should know who I am

116
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,699
because I used to come up here every

117
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,500
year when I play for the Dolphins also

118
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,469
played for the Saints in my last years

119
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,129
with the Baltimore Ravens I'm here

120
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:47,760
because I'm the captain of the NFL all

121
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:47,759
cannabis team

122
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:58,300
yeah that was a joke you know so no you

123
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:02,949
know I'm here to tell my story you know

124
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:07,060
back in 2002 2003 2004

125
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:09,879
I failed a couple drug tests and almost

126
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,490
ended my career and I was looking back

127
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,769
at some articles written at the time and

128
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,590
and what everyone is talking about now I

129
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:20,709
was saying that back then and so you

130
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:22,239
know it's real and I think I'm a I'm a

131
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,060
living breathing example of it I led the

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,829
NFL in rushing in 2002 using cannabis

133
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,500
instead of opioids instead of indocin

134
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:31,509
and tore it all and so I know it works

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:42,728
and that's why I'm here let's give them

136
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:45,189
all a hand look we know doctors are

137
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:46,829
smart because they're doctors but at

138
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:49,689
least they think they are sometimes yeah

139
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:51,759
just a joke but but these other guys are

140
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:53,978
incredibly intelligent as well and

141
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,800
really all four of these guys I respect

142
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:58,478
obviously as athletes and and as men but

143
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,550
all four of these guys I've gotten to

144
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,680
know and are really really intelligent

145
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,689
guys so it's a pleasure for me to be

146
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,870
able to moderate a panel with with the

147
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:09,759
quality we have right here today so

148
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,340
really you can break down the main

149
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,199
applications of cannabis within both pro

150
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,119
sports and really all athletics in my

151
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,329
opinion to two things and it's its focus

152
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,709
and recovery or the main applications

153
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:22,389
personally I'm I'm kind of more of an

154
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:24,250
extreme sports guy and I like to use

155
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:27,280
cannabis for focus and I talk about that

156
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,449
a lot normally maybe we'll dive in at

157
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,699
the end but today we're really gonna

158
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,439
have more of a laser focus on both the

159
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:34,959
NFL guys that thought at the pro level

160
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,478
and an alternative to opioid in the

161
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,180
recovery realm of cannabis

162
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,519
you know NFL's a brutal game extremely

163
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,530
violent causes severe injuries even to

164
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:46,389
the strongest of men and injury is the

165
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,369
biggest problem in NFL team faces

166
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,379
they're looking how do we keep these

167
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,939
guys on the field oftentimes not

168
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:54,459
thinking about the person that's behind

169
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,939
that number and really that's why we're

170
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,399
here today

171
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:59,110
so I looked at it I was walking with

172
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,399
Nate and eben and they were telling me

173
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,689
what happens when you get caught you get

174
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,099
a little tap on the shoulder and they

175
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,810
throw up

176
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,610
I get you and you get your stuff out of

177
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,189
the locker room and you're gone you know

178
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,780
and really I feel like they're looked at

179
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,189
as machines and you know you can replace

180
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,289
these parts and get them back on the

181
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,540
field but when it's too expensive when

182
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,129
we just get a new machine and the human

183
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,470
being right there is lost and and that

184
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:22,589
kind of disgust me about the NFL to be

185
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,510
honest and again why we're here today so

186
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:26,849
you know the the moral dilemma for these

187
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,560
guys is hey do I do whatever it takes

188
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,939
and shove these pills down my throat

189
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,580
because the NFL's telling me I have to

190
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,379
or do I do what it takes to go home to

191
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,050
my family and have you know my brain be

192
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:39,360
intact later on in life so Nate why

193
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,219
don't you tell us about I think it's an

194
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,250
interesting story just how drug tested

195
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:47,639
in the NFL works and then in particular

196
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:50,960
when you get caught what happens well

197
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,960
Rick you talk about when you get caught

198
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:57,509
my question I'll talk about I have a PhD

199
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,830
in the drug program yeah I'll talk about

200
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:00,269
how you beat it and then he'll talk

201
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,270
about how what it's like when you get

202
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:06,269
caught but it's actually so the NFL drug

203
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:08,399
testing comes in two and two facets one

204
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:10,529
is for street drugs and one is for

205
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,659
performance-enhancing drugs the street

206
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:14,879
drugs like cannabis and like other party

207
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:16,679
drugs is a once-a-year test and it

208
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,539
happens typically in May June or July

209
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,179
somewhere around many camps or training

210
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:22,529
camps and if you pass that one test then

211
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,209
you're good for the rest of the year and

212
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,089
you don't get tested again and so guys

213
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:30,090
you know abstain in advance of the test

214
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,590
and then once they pass that then they

215
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,210
can use it during the season to medicate

216
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,460
but for guys who get caught up in the

217
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,080
drug program the drug testing or the

218
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,910
drugs substance abuse program like

219
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,490
you'll talk about it's two three four

220
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:43,589
times every week you get tested all year

221
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,480
long for multiple years of clean test

222
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,710
before you're pulled off of that and so

223
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,769
it's those guys who get put in those

224
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:52,350
programs who can't use it and are given

225
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,449
more dangerous alternatives instead the

226
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,139
substance I'm sorry the

227
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,840
performance-enhancing drugs

228
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,490
happen all year long it can happen in

229
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,560
the off season it happened one time to

230
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,930
me in the off season and their protocol

231
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,969
is when they truck when they test you

232
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:08,009
you have to remove your shirt pull your

233
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,080
pants below your knees and they have to

234
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,230
stand perpendicular to you and watch the

235
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,210
urine exit your body

236
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,710
that's what they do and so they came to

237
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,300
my parents house in San Jose in the

238
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,190
offseason and came into the bathroom

239
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,589
that I grew up in and stood there and

240
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,330
watched me pee in a cup so it is a

241
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,240
little bit of an objectification going

242
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,740
on but I never got i never tested

243
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,840
positive and so i was able to use it

244
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,220
during the season where as ricky can

245
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,350
talk about what happens when you get

246
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,940
caught up in the system I tested

247
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,940
positive and I still continue to use it

248
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,029
I'm actually working on an article right

249
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:42,399
now for marijuana calm about how to pass

250
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,850
the drug test

251
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,939
although I failed for I passed probably

252
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:53,330
400 500 tests so when you when you get

253
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,640
cotton in the in the nfl's substance of

254
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,050
abuse program you get a letter in the

255
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,000
mail that says you're gonna go through

256
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,250
stage one to determine if you have a

257
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,289
substance abuse problem and so they send

258
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,909
you sent me to Atlanta and I spent a

259
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,199
whole day not with three different

260
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:09,339
psychiatrists filled out all this

261
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,390
paperwork just so that they can tell me

262
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,660
that I have a substance abuse problem

263
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:16,159
but no matter what the psychiatrists say

264
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:18,259
you have a substance abuse problem and

265
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,659
they put you in a drug treatment program

266
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:22,700
with the NFL for for two years and if

267
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,309
you stay clean for two years you're out

268
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,230
of that you're out of the program and so

269
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:29,689
when what happened to me is I was

270
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,310
playing for for New Orleans and the New

271
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,050
Orleans I tested in training camp which

272
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:34,759
was in late July and then I got traded

273
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:39,379
to Miami and in Miami they tested in May

274
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:43,159
and I didn't get the memo so I was in

275
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:46,340
the drug program and and you know it's

276
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:47,750
like Nate was saying I hated it when I

277
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,460
first got in I was I was actually

278
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,750
excited about the opportunity to talk to

279
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,769
someone because part of the program is

280
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,850
they give you someone to talk to you

281
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:57,350
once a week in a mandatory hour and uh

282
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,060
and then when I went to talk to him all

283
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:03,920
he talked to me about was how to not

284
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:05,659
fail the drug test all right and then I

285
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,000
was tested nine times a month and it's

286
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:09,980
wherever I go in the world I have to

287
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,750
call the NFL before I leave before I get

288
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,210
on a plane and say I'm going I'll be at

289
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,210
this address for this long this is when

290
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,710
I arrive this is when I leave and at the

291
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,170
address I give them no other address

292
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,970
they can call me anytime they want and I

293
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:25,549
have four hours to pee in a cup from

294
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,060
that time at that location so it's very

295
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:28,189
stressful

296
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:30,469
especially when you know failing a

297
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,150
second drug test you're fined one fourth

298
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,639
of your salary another test you're

299
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:38,299
suspended for games so it's very

300
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,830
stressful even even when I wasn't using

301
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,599
cannabis it was stressful because if I

302
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,480
couldn't get to that location in four

303
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,000
hours you know it was tough and I think

304
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,769
right now the NFL is is moving to the

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,169
NFL Players Association is moving to

306
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,539
propose that cannabis is taken off the

307
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:55,849
banned substance list and recognizing

308
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:58,699
that it's not as an abuse problem but

309
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,720
it's a health issue and in research even

310
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,670
though there hasn't been that much has

311
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,399
come to the point where we're divorced

312
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:08,269
Smith the executive director of the of

313
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,709
our union has finally like hopped on

314
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:11,389
board and said okay there's something we

315
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,519
have we have to look at this differently

316
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:15,409
and and finally the Union is taking a

317
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,879
step forward to to have the players

318
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:18,829
backs and I think that's a step in the

319
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,779
right direction to change this

320
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,280
antiquated punitive drug program that

321
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,809
doesn't help players just punishes them

322
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:33,350
for taking for trying to take care of

323
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:35,299
themselves yeah and you know yeah it's

324
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,490
I'll take it however we can get it it's

325
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:39,229
a little sad to me watching and really

326
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,090
seeing that it's it's a numbers game to

327
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,409
them it's not really a to me from what

328
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,910
I'm seeing about the people but when you

329
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:46,189
show them that this stuff actually will

330
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:48,559
save you money you know on opioids and

331
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,060
actually have your players in better

332
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,709
shape that's what they really care about

333
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,209
and that's the whole point here this

334
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,490
stuff does work and it's a very very

335
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,759
viable alternative to give you adjust of

336
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:01,430
some quick data 33,000 Americans die

337
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,379
every year of opioid overdoses that's a

338
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:06,409
that's a big number and that's a number

339
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:08,720
that does not have to happen NFL players

340
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:11,209
are over four times as likely to become

341
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,129
addicted to painkillers so what at the

342
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16,009
point I wanted to come out of that story

343
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:17,450
is also once you're caught once now your

344
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,769
pigeon-holed into having those pills

345
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,750
shoved down your throat because you have

346
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,279
zero other alternatives to quitting and

347
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,919
I mean Ricky you pretty much did quit

348
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,659
and and walk away from it so that's why

349
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:28,129
I got a lot of respect for that and I

350
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:29,959
feel bad for these guys that are still

351
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:34,070
having that happen so that's why I'm

352
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,990
here today I want to see that change so

353
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,820
we're gonna get into some other stuff

354
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,740
empirical data charts and start letting

355
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,960
the doctors backup our stories here

356
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,149
is is there any stories that you guys

357
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,950
want to tell that are in particular one

358
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,389
that's very quick to me that just rings

359
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,490
of there's a problem here at the Super

360
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,319
Bowl there's a commercial for something

361
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,539
called oh I see it's opioid-induced

362
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,640
constipation so if you can't go poop

363
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:57,319
movant 'ok yeah there we go if you can't

364
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,330
go poop with your opiates we've got

365
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,820
another pill for you to take and man

366
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,860
when's the third one gonna come out so

367
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,060
any stories that you guys got that that

368
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,190
kind of you want to share with the

369
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:08,539
audience that exemplify these issues or

370
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:17,000
did we already kind of go through that

371
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:19,370
oh I'll share some stuff so you know

372
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,759
really the process and football is just

373
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,590
a daily process of managing pain and

374
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,049
dealing with pain whether you have a

375
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,899
severe injury like a dislocated shoulder

376
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:32,000
and a torn labrum or herniated disk in

377
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:35,090
your back and sciatica running down your

378
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,799
leg making your foot numb you know all

379
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,769
these things that each guy on here is

380
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,269
dealt with a severe an immense amount of

381
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:43,909
pain throughout his lifetime in his

382
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,340
career in football so what are you doing

383
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:49,219
to deal with that you're taking you know

384
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:52,040
handfuls of indocin and cata flam these

385
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,139
highly potent anti-inflammatories that

386
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:57,049
wreak havoc on your digestive system

387
00:15:54,139 --> 00:16:00,620
your kidney and liver you know taking

388
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:02,870
opiates before the game day before the

389
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,730
game before the game after the game day

390
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,529
after the game this is how you're

391
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,960
getting out of pain and it's you know

392
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:10,819
basically just this vicious cycle and

393
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,340
for me really the painkillers the

394
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,560
opiates they made me feel insane they

395
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,629
made my mind crazy they made me really

396
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:20,329
angry towards my girlfriend at the time

397
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:21,980
my wife now towards my mother it's

398
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,560
people that were trying to care for me

399
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,170
in these really vulnerable times of

400
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,629
injury you know I wasn't able to

401
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:33,049
function you know I wasn't able to do

402
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:36,470
anything these things made it difficult

403
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:38,359
to sleep I was waking up at 3 o'clock in

404
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,029
the morning with withdrawal symptoms if

405
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,680
any of you have ever experienced that

406
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:45,829
something like a knife twisting in your

407
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:49,309
gut cold sweats chills all the above you

408
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:51,720
feel nuts juxtaposing that experience in

409
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:54,059
my experience when I consumed cannabis

410
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,819
was very healing and relaxed me there

411
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:59,638
eased my anxiety and my depression made

412
00:16:56,818 --> 00:17:02,818
it easier to sleep ease the pain in my

413
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,990
physical body as well as rejuvenated me

414
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:09,658
emotionally and spiritually and gave me

415
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:12,509
the energy and the fulfillment I needed

416
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:14,520
to go out the next day and play and do

417
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:15,779
it again at a hundred percent cuz every

418
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,699
single day you've got to be out there

419
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,269
ready to give it everything you've got

420
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,788
in practice let alone Sunday so cannabis

421
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:37,139
can be a very profound solution to those

422
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:38,369
things and thanks in some layman's terms

423
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,610
and then I want to hand this over to the

424
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:43,439
doctors but the way I see this is I've

425
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:44,668
been on both I'm an athlete I'm not a

426
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,710
pro athlete but I've been hurt pretty

427
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:50,669
bad many times and I've been on opioids

428
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,019
and my bad back is an example and what

429
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,490
really people need to do is start

430
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:55,259
looking at their their whole body

431
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,000
strengthening themselves looking at more

432
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,009
of an Eastern philosophy on some levels

433
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,720
of taking care of your body versus

434
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:04,829
putting a pill in it to fix it fix your

435
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,298
body and opioids had always for me I'm a

436
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:07,889
little out of pain but I want to lie in

437
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:11,009
my bed and not don't want to do [ __ ]

438
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:13,080
really to put it bluntly and when when I

439
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:15,179
take cannabis I'm able to both be out of

440
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,129
pain but also mentally not have that fog

441
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,538
that allows me to work out and kind of

442
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,090
reiterating what I've been said there so

443
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:23,700
it allows us to still work out and be

444
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:25,168
athletic and strengthen the pieces of

445
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,538
our body whether we're pro or average

446
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:30,360
Joe to get healthy versus just relying

447
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:32,849
on a pill and now as we go to the

448
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,259
doctor's I will show a short here in a

449
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:38,298
minute but what I'd like to do is have

450
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:42,119
dr. Nathan and dr. Solomon explain

451
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:43,980
cannabis all cannabidiol CBD is what

452
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,779
most people know it has and also the

453
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,429
endocannabinoid system which is a pretty

454
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:49,079
interesting thing I think a lot of

455
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:50,548
physicians don't even hear about this

456
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,710
through medical school just because it's

457
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:56,129
kind of a hidden thing but it is in with

458
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,179
all within all of us so you guys want to

459
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,770
split it up and one of you talked a

460
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,788
little bit about CBD and the other about

461
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:01,788
the endocannabinoid system

462
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:08,440
I think needs to be brought out about

463
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:10,510
education and how the medical system is

464
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,669
essentially ignoring the whole issue and

465
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:15,490
doctors are coming out of medical school

466
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:17,860
even from you know probably or across

467
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,440
the street completely ignorant about the

468
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:21,819
endocannabinoid system and out of the

469
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,650
hundred and forty-four medical schools

470
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:26,528
in the country one teaches a course on

471
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:29,340
the endocannabinoid system and about 13%

472
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:32,019
of the other 144 mention it in passing

473
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,519
so a lot of the times the physicians are

474
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:35,710
coming out of medical school knowing

475
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,990
absolutely nothing about this whole

476
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:41,829
wonderful system that helps protect the

477
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:43,778
body CBD THC etc you know it's just that

478
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:46,119
they come out not knowing anything about

479
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:48,278
it so we encourage all the physicians

480
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,319
who are here and this is a great venue

481
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:53,140
to be able to get introduced to what's

482
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,788
going on and that it really is a science

483
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,110
and the endocannabinoid system has been

484
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:59,408
around since the nineteen or discover

485
00:19:56,109 --> 00:20:01,869
the 1970s and it really does work to

486
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:04,419
help inflammation to help fight pain and

487
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:06,038
it just needs to be used by many for

488
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:08,380
more physicians and I understand there's

489
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:11,440
an issue about a doctor recommending it

490
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,789
in terms of player comes and sits there

491
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,730
and he's in pain and there's a

492
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:18,788
prescription pad and one of them is for

493
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,679
an opioid that's measurable it's easy

494
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:23,200
you're right one pill or two pills take

495
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,788
this it mean it's a known dose etc the

496
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,649
other side says well here's cannabis

497
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:29,259
well what are you right how can you

498
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:32,109
possibly tell someone what to do it's a

499
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:34,119
very individualistic mechanism that

500
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:36,009
works and it's not the same for every

501
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,989
single person so there's an education

502
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:39,398
process for the physician to understand

503
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,528
what's going on and it starts with

504
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:46,178
medical school and continues and places

505
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:49,569
like this and actually pick up on that

506
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:51,940
thread talking about education it was in

507
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:55,569
medical school where I think I was

508
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,850
turned from a drug warrior as we all

509
00:20:55,569 --> 00:21:00,129
grew up or at least those of us who were

510
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:02,798
in the just say no generation and

511
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,570
thinking that drugs are bad and the

512
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,808
people who use them are bad and the

513
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:11,889
people who sell them are worse and

514
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:13,928
unworthy of their freedom and as I

515
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,538
proceeded through my residency in

516
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:18,840
psychiatry where

517
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:22,528
I studied a lot of substance abuse I was

518
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:26,220
really shocked that my teachers in a

519
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:29,190
highly respected residency program were

520
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,079
very much for the drug war and I'm

521
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,389
thinking you're trying to help these

522
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:36,658
people you're trying to help these

523
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:38,939
individuals who are struggling with

524
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,499
substances and you still want to punish

525
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,538
them do you think that's really gonna

526
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:46,108
help them and you know as Russell Brand

527
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:48,538
said if being in an alley with some

528
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:50,728
smelly people and injecting yourself

529
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:52,288
with God knows what using shared needles

530
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:55,229
if that's not enough to make you stop

531
00:21:52,288 --> 00:21:57,450
the threat of the law putting you in a

532
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:59,700
room where you get food three times a

533
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,989
day and you get to shower and all of

534
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,048
that that's it that's not going to stop

535
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:06,090
you and I couldn't understand why my

536
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:08,298
teachers didn't understand that and then

537
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:10,228
as I proceeded through my career as a

538
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:14,598
psychiatrist is a general adult

539
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:17,190
psychiatrist in central New Jersey I

540
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:21,118
started seeing how lives were being

541
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,558
wrecked by marijuana and virtually none

542
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:23,939
of them were because of the effects of

543
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,940
the drug it was because of the effects

544
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,370
of the law and that's what really got me

545
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:34,620
thinking

546
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:34,619
[Applause]

547
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,900
that's what got me thinking that I think

548
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,269
I need to do something about this it was

549
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,950
bothering me so much especially because

550
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:45,930
I would think back to those teachers of

551
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,519
mine and what how they wanted to handle

552
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:52,860
even something like marijuana and I

553
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:56,339
realized that this is and this is an

554
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:58,199
issue of ethics morality and of course

555
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:01,199
it's an issue of the law because of the

556
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,360
way the laws are written and I started

557
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,289
getting involved in this realized that

558
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:10,979
there was no forum for doctors to speak

559
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:12,750
out comfortably in public about this

560
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,000
issue and I know that because I did it

561
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,829
and found out what happens when you do

562
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,480
that I wrote an op-ed for The Wall

563
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,889
Street Journal in 2010 that's really

564
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,420
what got the whole thing started for me

565
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:26,340
and when realizing that there was no

566
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,019
organizing force that's when I came up

567
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:32,309
with the idea for doctors for cannabis

568
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:34,500
regulation look up at DF CR you can see

569
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:38,099
our Declaration of Principles that was

570
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,440
signed almost exactly a year ago and it

571
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:42,629
was not long after that that somebody

572
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,900
who is not in this room Eugene Munroe

573
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:49,470
who some of you may know as actually a

574
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:52,350
very effective advocate among NFL errs

575
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:56,009
and he actually was the first active NFL

576
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:59,069
player to come out after which he was

577
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:00,900
cut had the opportunity to continue

578
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:05,789
playing but decided his body had had

579
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:08,519
enough and came to D F CR and said look

580
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:10,230
you know doctors and players we can

581
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,750
actually bring this message to the

582
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,319
public in a really effective way and he

583
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,779
said that will open the door and you

584
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,309
guys go through and I think what you're

585
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:23,339
seeing on this stage right now with

586
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:25,200
these four fantastic and eloquent

587
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:26,459
individuals telling their stories and

588
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,279
sharing what they've learned about

589
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,600
cannabis and us being able to back it up

590
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,259
with some of the science and I know you

591
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,819
asked about science this has been a

592
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:37,500
highly effective campaign that we

593
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:39,599
launched in November of last year

594
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,869
doctors and players for NFL cannabis

595
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,908
reform and a couple of days after we

596
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:47,969
launched the campaign the NFL

597
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:49,379
it's website as my son who loves

598
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,589
following everything football was

599
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:55,738
pointing out ran its first article

600
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:58,858
saying that you know we've said the

601
00:24:55,739 --> 00:25:00,960
doctor that the NFL isn't gonna take any

602
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:03,269
action until our doctors tell us it's

603
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,239
okay right you know the doctors that

604
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:08,608
they pay are going to tell them you know

605
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:16,729
what what they think if that means

606
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:21,569
changing the status quo and and the

607
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:21,869
players who sorry lost my train of

608
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:23,128
thought

609
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:26,908
I haven't spoken in front of a group

610
00:25:23,128 --> 00:25:28,848
this big in a very long time this is a

611
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:30,929
cannabis talk so you know we can

612
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:33,118
occasionally it's not bad

613
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,309
and yeah I want to bring it back guys I

614
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:38,069
do want to bring it back it's it's when

615
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:45,898
you know when Lance said that he wanted

616
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:48,470
to share some stuff Abid I'll I think a

617
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:52,498
lot of you know right cannabidiol is

618
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:55,319
mostly a CBD I'm sorry is mostly a

619
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:58,409
cannabinoid receptor antagonist and it

620
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,089
does it in such a way which is of course

621
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:03,389
complicated and not fully understood

622
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:06,689
that has effects that are somewhat

623
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:08,548
balancing to THC so I know that there's

624
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,808
not a lot of objective evidence I heard

625
00:26:08,548 --> 00:26:11,069
a talk yesterday where people were

626
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:13,739
talking about that that there's not a

627
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:16,950
lot of objective evidence for the

628
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:20,009
entourage effect and that's true for a

629
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,929
lot of the assertions with the medical

630
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:24,149
effects of cannabis but I will say there

631
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,038
is plenty of anecdotal evidence there's

632
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:28,348
a lot of common sense involved and

633
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:29,970
actually there is a report that all of

634
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:31,739
you should read from the National

635
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,589
Academies of science engineering and

636
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:37,169
medicine from January of this year that

637
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:42,928
was a body that very critically looked

638
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:44,489
at this notion of of what cannabis can

639
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:47,659
be used for what are the health effects

640
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:50,429
and they came to conclusions that any

641
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:53,789
politician who would read it which is

642
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:55,200
probably none of them would have to come

643
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:57,450
to the conclusion that there is indeed

644
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,960
medical use and the policy doesn't make

645
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,730
sense and

646
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,519
as you guys probably know historically

647
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,649
this conversation every time doctors

648
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,210
have been asked to really critically

649
00:27:04,648 --> 00:27:08,699
study this issue they come to the same

650
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,940
conclusion which is it really shouldn't

651
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,548
be against the law and it's with the

652
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,528
doctors and the players that we have

653
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:18,089
been highly effective I know we're

654
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:20,909
always going with that previous comment

655
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:25,648
which is that there is and I I'll shut

656
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:27,120
up after this that there is really a you

657
00:27:25,648 --> 00:27:29,009
know if there's an ulterior motive for

658
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,319
doctors for cannabis regulation to be

659
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:34,319
doing what we're doing with the NFL

660
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:38,099
because you know 1500 1600 guys every

661
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,869
year are directly affected active

662
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:41,668
players and and all of the retired

663
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,500
players who are still dealing with the

664
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:45,538
injuries that they suffered it's not

665
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,960
just about them because what they

666
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:51,720
represent is a microcosm of society and

667
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,169
what society has had to deal with with

668
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,000
rules that make no sense evidenced by

669
00:27:55,169 --> 00:28:00,090
the degree to which the enforcement of

670
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,669
this is so half-hearted that's why

671
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:05,308
they're telling us when we're going to

672
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:07,020
get our drug tests because they really

673
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:09,329
don't want to ban us but they know they

674
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:12,119
have to continue with this and nobody's

675
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:15,178
exactly sure why well I have some ideas

676
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:17,339
of why you know doing doing a lot of

677
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:20,100
these panels and hearing the discussion

678
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:22,740
I understand it's easy to look at the

679
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:25,079
NFL and say the NFL needs to change the

680
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,669
way it looks at cannabis but the NFL is

681
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,168
gonna follow or whatever wherever the

682
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:29,580
money is and whatever the fans are

683
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:31,020
saying and it's the same thing that's

684
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:33,178
that's what our government was built on

685
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:35,339
and I know for me coming out and talking

686
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,659
about my cannabis use even though

687
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,908
everyone knew it

688
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:40,350
for a long time still still took me a

689
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:42,360
while and it wasn't till two years ago

690
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:44,219
where I was finally like you know I

691
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:45,869
could pretend that I don't but everyone

692
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,130
already knows that I do so [ __ ] it and

693
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,619
so

694
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:52,130
it's uh I came and sat on the panel and

695
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:54,779
I was able to talk about it

696
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:58,289
and I and I treated the leave if all the

697
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:59,869
the closeted cannabis consumers would

698
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:02,308
just be honest things would change

699
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:04,649
faster than with any any of us can do

700
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:07,259
even if everyone in the NFL wanted to do

701
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,870
it it's really up to you it's up to the

702
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:12,029
people and so one of the reasons I'm

703
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:14,129
here talking is maybe one person in the

704
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:15,899
crowd talked to someone else to talk to

705
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,450
someone else and they finally step out

706
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,519
of the closet and her are honest about

707
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,929
about what cannabis is meant for them

708
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,099
and it's done for them you know I've

709
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,048
talked to a lot of people and I'm always

710
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:27,000
curious it's like how did you start

711
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:28,558
using cannabis like how did it become

712
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,690
something that was appealing to you and

713
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,428
across the board over ninety percent of

714
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,650
the people said I was hanging out with a

715
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:36,659
friend and I had some sort of injury a

716
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,090
knee injury ankle injury a broken heart

717
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,799
something going on in their lives and

718
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:42,899
they noticed that when they used when

719
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,700
they used cannabis recreationally that

720
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,080
whatever they were dealing with got

721
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,179
better and I think there's something

722
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:53,069
about us inherently that when something

723
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:54,990
works we tend to go back to it you know

724
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:56,819
to complement that Rickey I think like

725
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,519
let's go outside a cannabis like I've

726
00:29:56,819 --> 00:30:02,009
watched cannabis acceptance happen and

727
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,658
I'm I lived in San Francisco and and

728
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:06,179
have watched you know through the AIDS

729
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:07,530
movement and and the gay rights and

730
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,759
everything that's happened kind of in

731
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:10,259
the epicenter of where I live in

732
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,089
acceptance no one should live in the

733
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:13,829
closet for anything and it's liberating

734
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:15,899
except out of the closet whatever you

735
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:20,250
may be in the closet for step out man it

736
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:21,870
feels good it was funny so we had a we

737
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,019
had a friend over at our house we

738
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:26,519
different over our house and um and we

739
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,900
were we were consuming cannabis together

740
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,259
and one of the things he talked about

741
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,690
was he's he's been smoking for over 20

742
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:35,908
years he had been married for I think 15

743
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:42,919
years and he's never consumed in front

744
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:42,919
of his wife she's not even against it

745
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:50,009
what stigma runs deep interesting thing

746
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:51,779
that goes on with football players is

747
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:54,119
that we are always taught to shut up

748
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:56,039
shut up and play don't talk about your

749
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:58,379
pain don't talk about how you feel and

750
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,119
so in the realm of cannabis in football

751
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,840
you have like Ricky was saying a lot of

752
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,989
guys in the Claus

753
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,759
who use it and find benefits from it but

754
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,980
don't feel comfortable talking because

755
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,379
there's this code of silence in the NFL

756
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,509
and in football at all levels that tell

757
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,700
you to shut up and follow the plan and

758
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:17,069
the plan is not for you to be an

759
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,679
individual human being talking about the

760
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:21,899
fact that you are in pain but football

761
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,179
players do feel the pain and we have to

762
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:28,528
manage it one way or the other and I

763
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:30,390
always found that I healed faster when I

764
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:33,690
was consuming cannabis than when I was

765
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:35,159
doing pills to heal you have to feel you

766
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,558
have to feel what's going on with your

767
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,419
body pain serves a purpose and so for

768
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,308
guys who professional athletes who

769
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,799
tinkered with every single kind of

770
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:45,240
medication to come to the conclusion the

771
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:48,000
cannabis worked for them I think is

772
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,259
something something huge and guys are

773
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,419
coming out of the Woodworks and I think

774
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:58,259
it's an important conversation and Nate

775
00:31:51,419 --> 00:32:00,179
you you you're pointing you know it's

776
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:02,519
it's all retired players who are here

777
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,110
it's very hard to find active players

778
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:08,339
and you guys can comment on this it's

779
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:10,259
very hard because you'll get fired if

780
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:12,028
you're inside a locker room you don't do

781
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:15,079
anything to draw attention to yourself

782
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:17,278
whether it's cannabis or politics or

783
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:19,589
anything they don't want you to be a

784
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,808
human being and talk about your own

785
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:23,699
ideas so that's really hard when you

786
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:25,859
retire that's what they call it from

787
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,240
retiring from football but when you go

788
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:28,829
out into the real world we don't have

789
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,960
the words we don't know how to

790
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:32,699
articulate our ideas and that that

791
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,870
there's like a five year period from

792
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,610
when you're done playing to when you

793
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:38,398
finally start to feel comfortable

794
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:40,288
talking about your own ideas and

795
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,058
articulating yourself and so that's a

796
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:44,308
big obstacle that these guys face and

797
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:45,389
it's only I mean also it hasn't been

798
00:32:44,308 --> 00:32:47,730
brought up that I think needs to be

799
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,140
addressed is opioids not only affect the

800
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,548
players who are taking since we're

801
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,490
talking about the NFL it affects their

802
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:55,648
families as well which is something that

803
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,359
wives and girlfriends know when they're

804
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:59,189
taking the opioids how it affects their

805
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,839
attitudes how it affects their emotions

806
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,390
and how it affects their relationships

807
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:05,668
is devastating to families in and of

808
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,020
itself other than the pain relief and

809
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:09,840
the opioid addiction that these players

810
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,609
are coming down with we're we have a

811
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,230
film that I might or might not show

812
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:14,339
there's two there's two subjects I'm

813
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,900
interested in covering but

814
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,668
where we show that that I think are

815
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,840
important so I'm actually gonna ask for

816
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:20,100
a show of hands because we don't we

817
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,509
haven't got a lot of time left I'm gonna

818
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:24,689
try and fit both in but I'm interested

819
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:26,519
to see we can talk about CTE and

820
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,860
concussion treatment and cannabis

821
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,349
relative to that or we can talk about

822
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:33,240
using it as focus as an athlete and

823
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:35,278
maybe talk little is it a PE D some

824
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,808
people think that some not and how maybe

825
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,089
we use cannabis when our training

826
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:46,069
regiments who here would rather hear

827
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:50,668
about CTE and the focus hands alright

828
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:51,778
alright see three wings today so this is

829
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:53,009
an interesting when I'm actually I'm

830
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:55,769
kind of glad we're going down this road

831
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:57,119
because there there's there's me and the

832
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:58,679
players here and there's the doctors and

833
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,898
the doctors have to stick to data and

834
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,490
empirical stuff and you know we're guys

835
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:04,288
that say we've lived this life we know

836
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,788
this works and it can say it that way

837
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:10,829
they can't really say it the way we can

838
00:34:05,788 --> 00:34:12,898
say it so maybe they can yeah that's not

839
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:14,699
oh thank you that's not always true I

840
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:16,710
mean it depends on how much you listen

841
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:18,239
and how much you want to take what the

842
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,190
players and other people who are taking

843
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,049
the opioids or cannabis how it really

844
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:24,148
affects them in terms of you don't have

845
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,220
to be a rocket scientist to know hey I

846
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:28,019
took this it didn't work now I take this

847
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,598
and it worked I mean yes it's not a

848
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:32,789
study from across the street or from any

849
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,530
Stanford University but it's good enough

850
00:34:32,789 --> 00:34:35,759
to be able to say yes let's try this

851
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,369
let's try something different

852
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,139
no no I'm not I'm I'm categorizing you

853
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:41,700
like the players you guys are are

854
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,530
handcuffed by what the institution

855
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:45,000
allows you to do it's kind of what I'm

856
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,649
trying to say so you do have to work

857
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,148
within a box you can't step just like

858
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:49,529
the players if you step out of that box

859
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:51,480
and start saying the wrong things you're

860
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,310
gone too you know and that's kind of

861
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,780
what I'm trying to purvey I don't know

862
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:56,789
if that's really true I mean being up

863
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,410
and speaking like Dustin Sulak to a lot

864
00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:00,719
of people who came physicians who came

865
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:01,710
here to talk about that I think I don't

866
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:03,389
know if that's really stepping out of

867
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,250
the box it's just acknowledging one that

868
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:07,348
there's a problem and two that yes there

869
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,239
could be a solution and we may have the

870
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:12,450
solution to be able to help that problem

871
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:14,848
a lot of doctors are really trained that

872
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:16,799
we have to go with the evidence and it's

873
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:18,660
got to be evidence-based and I see heads

874
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,250
nodding right now and I appreciate that

875
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:22,139
and I grew up in the same ear and I do

876
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,250
feel that way and when I hear about

877
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:25,618
anecdotal evidence

878
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,889
you know I hesitate just a bit because

879
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,990
it hasn't been established in the

880
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:32,329
richer in the same way but I think that

881
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:35,479
the greatest argument for policy change

882
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:37,639
is not nitpicking over the details of

883
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,740
what exactly cannabis can do and that

884
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:42,109
book that came out earlier this year

885
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:46,399
from the National Academies really does

886
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:47,539
lay out the case for that fact we only

887
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,210
have a few minutes I want to get into

888
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:51,920
CTE so it's a non negative argument that

889
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,809
is actually the best it doesn't hurt

890
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,960
that bad and so why are we preventing

891
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:58,940
people from using it strong point and I

892
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,409
I agree with that but I just don't have

893
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,309
a lot of time and where I'm going with

894
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:05,539
this is because we're talking about CTE

895
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:09,469
there's going to be different levels of

896
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:11,599
commitment and and support for CBD and

897
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:13,609
its usage for CTE because there's not

898
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,949
empirical data behind it to the level we

899
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,690
should have and I wish we had time to

900
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:19,279
show you the marijuana that the I think

901
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,380
it's Mississippi and the only marijuana

902
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,600
these guys are allowed to research it's

903
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:26,720
it's in California we call a ditch weed

904
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,159
or schwag it's horrible and so they're

905
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:32,029
they're handcuffed to I mean what they

906
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,859
have to research is awful empirical data

907
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,470
well here's a study by su Sicilies do it

908
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:38,539
looking at PTSD on trauma traumatic

909
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:39,949
brain injury and from the University of

910
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:42,769
Mississippi the only place that they're

911
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:44,599
allowed to use the cannabis for she's

912
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:46,219
you know we've talked about what it is

913
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,199
that they send her and it's essentially

914
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:50,000
seed stems and planned ground together

915
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:51,889
in a little baggie that's fresh frozen

916
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,329
and shipped off to her with no

917
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:55,789
acknowledgement about what the

918
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:57,739
concentration of THC CBD any of the

919
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:58,009
terpenes anything at all but what's in

920
00:36:57,739 --> 00:36:59,719
it

921
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,910
here's your cannabis here's what you're

922
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:03,739
allowed to use so the study that she's

923
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:05,029
running if it comes out negative doesn't

924
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:06,589
mean it's negative it just means the

925
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,140
product that was given to her was

926
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:11,269
useless versus something that yes let's

927
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:13,339
study something so everyone's hamstrung

928
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:14,840
in terms of what it is to be able to do

929
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,210
because they don't want the results

930
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,430
being shown yeah and as we go back to

931
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,900
CTE this this started everybody should

932
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:22,190
watch a movie called concussion if they

933
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,990
haven't seen it with Will Smith it's

934
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,940
it's an eye-opening tear-jerking movie

935
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:29,479
and it tells you really the way this all

936
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:31,309
unfolded and and it was ugly and at this

937
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,500
point there's you know it was jr. say oh

938
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:36,170
who really when he killed himself as a

939
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,639
basically hall-of-famer they couldn't

940
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,909
they couldn't wipe it under you know

941
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:40,828
scrape it under the rug

942
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:42,779
they did that with hundreds other before

943
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:45,359
hundreds of others before that Dave

944
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,680
Mirra who's an ex BMX guy just killed

945
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:48,210
himself because of concussions and

946
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:49,969
concussions go way outside of football

947
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:54,030
to extreme sports surfing skateboarding

948
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:55,980
everything soccer even and so the CT

949
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:57,990
stuffs a big one and talking about how

950
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,108
to use CBD as a neuro protectant to

951
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:02,098
something I'm interested in and and

952
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:04,170
that's kind of where I was talking about

953
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:05,190
the empirical data versus anecdotal

954
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,079
evidence but I want to have you guys

955
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:11,159
talk about neuro protectant and CBD

956
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,960
together why don't I like to have the

957
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:15,538
players start on this one and kind of do

958
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,449
any of you use CBD I know Evan you have

959
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:20,190
a CBD company and you know why don't you

960
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:22,108
start in about your own personal usage

961
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:24,450
of CBD and relate it to neuro protection

962
00:38:22,108 --> 00:38:30,630
if you would do and do if you did indeed

963
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:32,848
you to use it that way well I think

964
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:35,640
probably most of you guys have read the

965
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:37,920
studies done by dr. McCollum and the

966
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:40,769
profound effects of the cannabinoids and

967
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,099
the brain and how they act as a neuro

968
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:46,829
protectant and an antioxidant you know

969
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:50,220
as a guy who consumed cannabis

970
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:55,130
throughout my NFL football career and a

971
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:57,538
guy who suffered you know handfuls of

972
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,920
concussions having my bell rung and I

973
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:01,170
was lucky enough never to be knocked

974
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,579
unconscious some of these guys might be

975
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,220
able to tell you a little bit more about

976
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:08,430
that but obviously concussions are an

977
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:09,899
incredibly prevalent issue with football

978
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:13,769
it's something that happens every single

979
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:17,519
play every single player is smashing

980
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:19,409
headfirst into another guy probably 6070

981
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,818
times a game so this is clearly

982
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:22,440
something that we need to find a

983
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:25,199
solution for I mean they've even done

984
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,369
studies that say 97% of the guys that

985
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,098
played in the NFL

986
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:32,250
are gonna come out on some scale with

987
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:34,950
CTE that's pretty scary being a guy who

988
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:38,010
spent 15 years in the game six years in

989
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:40,078
the league I was a very violent player I

990
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,940
don't think anybody gets that level

991
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,760
unless you're incredibly physical and

992
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:47,750
willing to put your body on the line

993
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,250
that being said you know the way that

994
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,519
concussions are dealt with is guys are

995
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:54,400
basically

996
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:57,130
sequestered your UCM walking around the

997
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,539
facility they'll have sunglasses on they

998
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,150
won't be allowed to go to meetings

999
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:02,170
they're not allowed to practice you're

1000
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,789
not really allowed to do much of

1001
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,590
anything you're kind of just stuck in a

1002
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:09,130
dark hole somewhere in the training

1003
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:11,590
facility but that being said like there

1004
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,780
needs to be a solution and there is the

1005
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,600
data there is the research we've seen a

1006
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:21,280
every guy up here I think is an example

1007
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:24,190
of the efficacy of cannabinoids on brain

1008
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,170
trauma I know that I am very grateful

1009
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,240
for my cannabis used to around my career

1010
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:30,730
because really I came out of my career I

1011
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:33,519
was able to get rid of all the pills I

1012
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,900
got off all the pills you know some guys

1013
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,960
are coming out of their career on

1014
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,940
anti-anxiety meds and antidepressants

1015
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,579
and painkillers and all this other [ __ ]

1016
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,440
that is really taxing and destroying

1017
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:45,279
their systems and their minds and their

1018
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,320
families

1019
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,730
you know guys are leaving the house they

1020
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,980
can't get home because they can't

1021
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:52,750
remember how to get back you know these

1022
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,659
are realities of the game and it's not

1023
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:58,329
just you know like Jim said jr. say oh I

1024
00:40:55,659 --> 00:41:00,819
think really shined a light on the

1025
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:02,409
darkness that awaits football players in

1026
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,720
their life after their careers if you're

1027
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:06,579
not taking care of yourself if we're not

1028
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,889
starting to address these issues with

1029
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:11,469
cannabis because really it's the only

1030
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:13,629
solution we're looking at and it needs

1031
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,939
to be changed we need to start growing

1032
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,039
up and looking at real solutions to

1033
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,570
keeping these guys from losing their

1034
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:21,570
minds and their lives

1035
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:32,409
I think in this realm cannabis and

1036
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,719
football is so interesting to study in

1037
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:36,429
regards to brain injuries because on the

1038
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,009
football field your most effective

1039
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:41,109
weapon is your head and the higher up

1040
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:43,480
you go the more your coach to attack

1041
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:45,190
that other human and put him on his ass

1042
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,559
and the way you do that is by hitting

1043
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:50,079
him with your face as hard as you can

1044
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,639
especially a guy who's larger so you

1045
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,489
know you're gonna have repetitive head

1046
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:57,129
trauma every day every week so how do

1047
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:59,139
you treat that inevitable head trauma

1048
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,760
and half of the guys are already using

1049
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:03,099
cannabis but they can't tell anyone

1050
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,290
about it the other half are not so how

1051
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:07,750
do we study what's working for who in

1052
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:10,119
the middle of this repetitive head

1053
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,199
trauma every day so these guys have to

1054
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,969
come out of the shadows to feel

1055
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,109
comfortable sharing that data and that's

1056
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:16,119
the only way we'll learn anything about

1057
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:18,099
it I think and and beyond it you're

1058
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,900
talking about neuroprotection and CBD

1059
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:22,569
does the neuro protection however the

1060
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,670
other thing that unfortunately this the

1061
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,530
football players are getting is toradol

1062
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,690
toradol is a nonsteroidal

1063
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,950
antiinflammatory platelet inhibitor so

1064
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,470
these guys are getting platelet

1065
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:34,750
inhibitors getting hit in the head

1066
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:36,969
causing concussions microbleeds in the

1067
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,440
brain causing effects that yet they

1068
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:40,449
don't even know what the result we know

1069
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,159
what the results are but everyone lines

1070
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:47,289
up for the T train yeah so in 2003 I was

1071
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,079
playing for the for the Dolphins and so

1072
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:51,880
2002 and 2003 I let the NFL and touches

1073
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,139
and if you've ever seen me run I'm a

1074
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,519
very physical runner so I was I was yeah

1075
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:59,409
thank you so I remember sitting in the

1076
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,929
in the training room one day for

1077
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:04,299
practice okay and watching guys come in

1078
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:06,219
one by one to get their toradol shot or

1079
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:09,039
to get their pills and it occurred to me

1080
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:11,619
like wow we need this strong

1081
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,659
anti-inflammatory just to practice on a

1082
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:15,789
daily basis and I decided you know what

1083
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:17,139
I'm gonna see how long I can go in the

1084
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:19,659
season without having to take these

1085
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:21,429
these pills and I was able to make

1086
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:25,359
through the whole season again leading

1087
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:27,399
the NFL in in touches so what what

1088
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,650
you're saying is so true and I think

1089
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,160
what what Evan touched on is taking care

1090
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:34,690
of yourself and I think for me when I

1091
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:37,690
played and I would take toradol or I

1092
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:39,400
would take vicodin it was more to mask

1093
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,289
Payne because I was I was in a lot of

1094
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,050
pain and when I used cannabis it was

1095
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:45,670
more to sit down on the ground and to

1096
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,980
think about my day to do a little bit of

1097
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,110
stretching to release the stress of the

1098
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,960
day to allow the inflammation to

1099
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:55,510
dissipate and it was more holistic and

1100
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,820
inclusive for me in my whole entire life

1101
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,800
and like Nate said earlier it made it

1102
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,440
easier to get back up the next day and

1103
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,660
go at it again and I think football

1104
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,670
players are a great example of people

1105
00:44:04,659 --> 00:44:08,889
living extreme lives having to deal with

1106
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:11,050
a lot of different stressors physically

1107
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:13,779
mentally and emotionally but I think all

1108
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,519
of us in our lives are dealing with some

1109
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,590
kind of stress and in some kind of pain

1110
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,480
that inhibits our ability to recover and

1111
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:21,970
heal and approach every day with with

1112
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,530
vigor and you guys know like the energy

1113
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:24,669
you have to have and you have to bring

1114
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,190
on a daily basis

1115
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:30,309
in the NFL and for that reason I think

1116
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:33,250
we're prime examples of people who who

1117
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:35,829
have through our own experiences have

1118
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,929
learned to to use cannabis in a more

1119
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:39,340
conscious way and I think that I was a

1120
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:50,230
lot to do with education and people

1121
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:51,550
telling their stories given that we've

1122
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,409
got these wonderful football players

1123
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,780
here and we have their attention we

1124
00:44:53,409 --> 00:44:58,629
thought we would spend we'll give you

1125
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:00,010
another up until 3 o'clock to do a Q&amp;A

1126
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,050
with the football players if you'd like

1127
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,970
to we do have the break going on in the

1128
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:06,220
in in sort of the lobby so if you do

1129
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:08,199
want to take a break please feel free to

1130
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:10,029
we're gonna have the QA if you do take a

1131
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:11,199
break please be cognizant we've got the

1132
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:13,780
camera running down the middle aisle

1133
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,369
here and over the center but we figured

1134
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,400
that we've got their attention so if

1135
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:20,019
we've got questions we can fire away we

1136
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,460
do have some mics in the audience and we

1137
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:26,920
can roll the roll the mics around to

1138
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:29,920
everybody who has questions as we one

1139
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,539
two there we go as we end this I want it

1140
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,250
there's a friend of mine named Steve

1141
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:35,559
DeAngelo who's been a big figure and

1142
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:37,210
almost a mentor to me in this space I

1143
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:39,940
know Ricky's friends with Steve also and

1144
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:41,710
what Steve taught me and I want to just

1145
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,480
have this be the parting words because

1146
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,980
again it transcends from the pros to

1147
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,050
average Joes and every one of us in this

1148
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,420
room you know I thought I was a STONER

1149
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,789
for a long time and I realized I used

1150
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,229
cannabis too

1151
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:54,449
make my mind right and it helped me

1152
00:45:52,228 --> 00:45:55,889
study through college it helped me be a

1153
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:57,778
better person it helped me be a better

1154
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:59,129
husband I don't go drink alcohol I go

1155
00:45:57,778 --> 00:46:01,139
take little cannabis and I'm a more

1156
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,338
engaged dad so when you look at your

1157
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:04,498
cannabis use if you think you're a

1158
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:06,150
STONER take another look at it and look

1159
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:07,798
like there's a reason you use it you

1160
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:10,829
come home maybe you have anxiety you're

1161
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:12,719
tired your back hurts most people that

1162
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:14,130
use cannabis are not stoners there's a

1163
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:15,630
root cause that they use it and it's

1164
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:25,858
because it's a beautiful plant so I want

1165
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:30,088
to impart you on that and and yeah let's

1166
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:33,568
go to questions for these guys and what

1167
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:36,659
advice would you give to pee wee

1168
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:40,288
football errs you know Greer out there

1169
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:42,719
they're out there doing what you guys do

1170
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:45,509
they're imitators and there but in their

1171
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:47,639
heads and my one of my grandson's is

1172
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:52,559
always already been hospitalized so what

1173
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:57,318
advice do you give to them and how do we

1174
00:46:52,559 --> 00:47:00,150
approach cannabis as a neuroprotective

1175
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:03,949
that's definitely one of my concerns as

1176
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:07,019
well is you know that the little guys

1177
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:08,459
but it's kind of in the same boat as you

1178
00:47:07,018 --> 00:47:11,868
know some kids that suffering from

1179
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:14,399
seizures from epilepsy and so forth and

1180
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:17,068
really should look at more to the CBD

1181
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:21,298
it's more of the you know non

1182
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:23,909
psychoactive part of the plant that

1183
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:26,369
would be in my opinion more suitable for

1184
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:29,009
you know the younger audience and you're

1185
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:30,838
using it and it's also been you know

1186
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:32,728
shown to have those neuroprotective

1187
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:36,449
agents as well as that you know

1188
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:40,498
antioxidants so that's part of you know

1189
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:42,869
why you know I'm a real passionate about

1190
00:47:40,498 --> 00:47:46,348
using this platform to cause awareness

1191
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:48,929
and education because it is you know I

1192
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:50,909
don't expect no one to really feel sorry

1193
00:47:48,929 --> 00:47:55,099
for me for what I went through you know

1194
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:57,900
we made this choice my biggest issue is

1195
00:47:55,099 --> 00:48:00,059
you know going back to the education and

1196
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,338
I really think the NFL is missing the

1197
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:04,160
opportunity to be a leader because they

1198
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:07,400
have I think one of the you

1199
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:12,920
best situations to prove out some of

1200
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:15,920
this data for you know the game for

1201
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,260
themselves but as well as you know the

1202
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,559
general public so again a CBT or the

1203
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:27,230
cannabidiol you heard people speak of I

1204
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:28,940
will look into that more I think the

1205
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,679
hard part about youth sports is you are

1206
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,720
you are leaving it up to the coach and

1207
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,460
and there are a lot of different coaches

1208
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:37,669
that coach youth football some of them

1209
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,289
are cognizant of head injuries and want

1210
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,700
to see their players healthy some of

1211
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:42,440
them want their kids to knock each other

1212
00:48:40,699 --> 00:48:44,689
out every day and you go and watch these

1213
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,340
practices and these men whose football

1214
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,530
careers didn't work out for them are

1215
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,750
living through these kids they're

1216
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:52,940
playing through these kids and that's

1217
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:54,530
when it becomes dangerous some of the

1218
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,700
drills they'll do at practice have a kid

1219
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:56,930
running from there and a kid running

1220
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:59,389
from there and meet in the middle

1221
00:48:56,929 --> 00:49:01,730
full-speed headfirst that can't be good

1222
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:03,529
for a seven-year-old brain and so paying

1223
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,420
attention to the coaches paying

1224
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:07,010
attention to the medical services that

1225
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,289
they provide or whatever hospitals or

1226
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,540
doctors they're working with and if your

1227
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:13,789
grandson has gone to the hospital for a

1228
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:15,860
head injury consult that doctor and ask

1229
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:17,659
if if he should be keep doing this

1230
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:20,390
considering the way he responds to

1231
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:21,980
hitting some guys are more susceptible

1232
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:23,539
to brain injuries than others I found

1233
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,730
that you know one guy will get hit and

1234
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:27,500
pop right back up another guy gets the

1235
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:30,500
same hit and he's woozy and he gets a

1236
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,420
concussion so some kids are not suited

1237
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,070
for it and we make the mistake of trying

1238
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,760
to funnel all of our boys onto the

1239
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,830
football field

1240
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,570
because it's so popular because it's so

1241
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:40,759
lucrative but not all boys are meant for

1242
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:42,740
it so my personally personal believe is

1243
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,220
eight-year-old shouldn't be smashing

1244
00:49:42,739 --> 00:49:47,269
heads but a lot of people love it it's

1245
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:48,500
not a guarantee you're gonna have a

1246
00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:50,150
brain injury but you just have to be

1247
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:55,699
diligent and pay attention to your child

1248
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:57,349
that's it just one more note on that I

1249
00:49:55,699 --> 00:50:01,029
don't think kids should play football

1250
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:01,029
until they're at least in high school

1251
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,670
thank you guys for being here my

1252
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:16,150
question is do you ever see a roll of

1253
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:19,599
cannabis being a prevention for so as a

1254
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:21,250
pretreatment before playing because we

1255
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,319
do know of an endocannabinoid deficiency

1256
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:25,000
is there a way that we can treat

1257
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:29,140
football players before they go on the

1258
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,960
field research being done of pure CBD to

1259
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:33,279
be able to be taken prophylactically

1260
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,570
hopefully those studies will come out so

1261
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,000
the yes that would be able to like a

1262
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:38,800
pill you take a capsule of CBD and you

1263
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,780
take in an hour before they would have

1264
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,120
sports and hopefully that would prevent

1265
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,680
all the neuro degeneration that we saw I

1266
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,029
think was yesterday

1267
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:48,909
and yeah hopefully that's gonna

1268
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:52,800
absolutely happen with pure CBD with no

1269
00:50:48,909 --> 00:50:54,940
THC activity whatsoever hopefully I

1270
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,830
think it's gotta get federally

1271
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,750
rescheduled or D scheduled before the

1272
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:01,239
before the NFL is gonna really jump on

1273
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,730
it you know there are 22 teams in the

1274
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:05,409
NFL in which they play in states where

1275
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:07,570
it is medically legal but for those

1276
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:09,639
other ten the NFL is going to consider

1277
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:11,289
that a lopsided product and it creates

1278
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:13,089
an unfair and advantage for one team and

1279
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:15,579
so I don't believe the NFL is gonna jump

1280
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:17,710
all over that argument I think they're

1281
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:19,929
kind of gonna wait and see they're not

1282
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,789
gonna lead the charge on a social issue

1283
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:24,669
the NFL just doesn't do that they lag

1284
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:26,230
behind and then react I think it's

1285
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:28,659
what's important is to arm the Union

1286
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:30,429
with all of this knowledge to let them

1287
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:32,349
come to the negotiating table and make

1288
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:33,879
their case strongly as of yet they

1289
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:35,170
haven't been able to do that Ricky was

1290
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,059
touching on it they're starting to come

1291
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:38,950
around to it but if they realized how

1292
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:41,679
important this plant is for their league

1293
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:43,059
and how much better it is for you than

1294
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,789
what these players are being injected

1295
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:47,289
with on company grounds then they'll

1296
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:48,969
start to come around I will say Nate

1297
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:50,650
when I talked to Dee last week on this

1298
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:52,419
issue and one of the things he said is

1299
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:54,369
the way the Players Association is

1300
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,930
approaching it it's not a drug issue

1301
00:51:54,369 --> 00:51:57,400
it's a health issue and so they're

1302
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:59,019
putting it on this on par with the

1303
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,950
concussion issue and they're saying it's

1304
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:01,360
not negotiable

1305
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:03,549
you know like we shouldn't have to

1306
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,050
negotiate to have concussion specialists

1307
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:07,120
on the sidelines we shouldn't have to

1308
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:09,700
negotiate to allow our players to not be

1309
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,589
punished for using cannabis Jerry Jones

1310
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:13,569
just stepped out in favor or said he

1311
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:16,180
thinks I think basically it should be

1312
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:17,800
legalized or authorized in the NFL

1313
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:19,480
it's changed happened slowly but having

1314
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,450
Jerry step out is one person so

1315
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,280
hopefully the rest will follow soon

1316
00:52:21,449 --> 00:52:26,289
let's ask a question if I could I'm

1317
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,940
Martin Lee the director of project CBD

1318
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:30,489
and you know the study you're referring

1319
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:32,318
to about CBT beam or protective there's

1320
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:34,419
also study about THC being your

1321
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,509
protective and antioxidant are you

1322
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:40,510
emphasizing CBD so much because of the

1323
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:42,460
possible legal opportunities there even

1324
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,780
though it still is federally illegal it

1325
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:48,940
makes it easier for sure well is it

1326
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,800
better I'm concerned about is it better

1327
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,240
for people in people's brains in terms

1328
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,890
of what cushions well I think right now

1329
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:55,449
what I've noticed least is it seems to

1330
00:52:53,889 --> 00:52:57,818
be some kind of taboo against altered

1331
00:52:55,449 --> 00:52:59,049
states of consciousness people aren't

1332
00:52:57,818 --> 00:53:02,710
willing to look at it or talk about it

1333
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:07,300
so we just say CBD but you know we got a

1334
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:09,039
lot of work to do is very important and

1335
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,318
it's more of an Eastern philosophy

1336
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:13,088
instead of isolating compounds from

1337
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:15,429
things in nature let's look at nature

1338
00:53:13,088 --> 00:53:16,650
and use nature and and really that is

1339
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:19,269
coming from a totally different

1340
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:20,980
perspective of take this pill to fix you

1341
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:23,259
and and I think that's a good question

1342
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:25,690
because I do I believe for myself I use

1343
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:28,390
THC all the time every day with CBD as

1344
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:30,250
well and it affects for me it helps me a

1345
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:31,629
lot more when there's THC included so I

1346
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:36,969
think whole plant medicine is a really

1347
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:38,680
important thing to think about I think I

1348
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:40,568
think you'll find that's the case with

1349
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:42,308
most football players who use it I don't

1350
00:53:40,568 --> 00:53:47,769
think they isolate with the CBD I think

1351
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:50,589
they are believers in the whole plan hi

1352
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:53,650
I have a question I just had a curiosity

1353
00:53:50,588 --> 00:53:55,808
while you were playing how were you able

1354
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:57,068
to get guidance as to how to use the

1355
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:59,349
cannabis were you using just

1356
00:53:57,068 --> 00:54:01,269
recreational versus medicinal grade and

1357
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:04,088
could you talk about the difference no

1358
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:05,650
guidance you're on your own but for

1359
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:07,929
professional athletes who have been

1360
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:09,639
tinkering with medication in their

1361
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:11,469
bodies and optimal performance their

1362
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:13,539
entire lives by the time you get to the

1363
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:14,980
NFL you have a pretty good idea of what

1364
00:54:13,539 --> 00:54:16,329
works for your body and what does and at

1365
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,210
least if you are medicating with

1366
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:20,890
cannabis so I I did it on my own I did

1367
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:22,960
it at home I don't know how these guys

1368
00:54:20,889 --> 00:54:24,670
did it but yeah it was it was in the

1369
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,829
shadows so we did not talk about it at

1370
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:31,680
work my name is Janice Knox and I am

1371
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:33,719
mechana md's and also represent the HD

1372
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,029
clinics which stand for American

1373
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:37,739
cannabinoid clinics and I have two

1374
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:40,500
points I want to make and why does that

1375
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:42,239
athletes are incredible role models so

1376
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,309
you guys are incredible role models for

1377
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:48,629
all those young boys who are playing

1378
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:51,179
football so my question is here what are

1379
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:53,849
you doing to get the current players to

1380
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:56,069
come out of the closet because they are

1381
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:58,409
role models and even if you can't

1382
00:54:56,070 --> 00:55:02,750
because you're not clinicians advise

1383
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:05,429
people to take CBD or THC or any of that

1384
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:08,699
looking at the current football players

1385
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:10,769
playing and role models admitting that

1386
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:13,489
they use this for their health reasons

1387
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:17,039
can you imagine what that would mean to

1388
00:55:13,489 --> 00:55:19,739
parents to coaches to to young kids

1389
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,320
playing so my question is what are you

1390
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:25,589
doing to encourage the current players

1391
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:30,210
who may be using cannabis step out of

1392
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:32,820
that closet I think just continuing to

1393
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:35,039
do stuff like this continuing to get our

1394
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,990
voices out there continuing to show guys

1395
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:40,320
that it's safe to share your stories and

1396
00:55:36,989 --> 00:55:42,029
it's safe to talk about obviously the

1397
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,880
current players have a number of hurdles

1398
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:47,850
obviously one losing your jobs and then

1399
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,309
two endorsements and all the companies

1400
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:51,960
that sponsor these athletes you know

1401
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:55,500
there's a lot of risk of having those

1402
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:58,260
things pulled but I think you know this

1403
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:01,440
this panel this this advocacy that we've

1404
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,060
been doing it's grown probably over the

1405
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,789
last two years since the first time I

1406
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:08,849
stepped foot in a cannabis conference

1407
00:56:05,789 --> 00:56:10,320
talking about my experience and we're

1408
00:56:08,849 --> 00:56:11,909
just I think we're going to continue to

1409
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,850
do that we're pretty passionate

1410
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:16,649
dedicated guys to we want you know our

1411
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:18,719
brothers in the leak to understand what

1412
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:21,980
this is all about and changed the stigma

1413
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:21,980
of what this plan can be

1414
00:56:26,518 --> 00:56:33,068
thank you oh hello yes thank you Bobby

1415
00:56:30,608 --> 00:56:35,078
West I have a question for you with all

1416
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:36,429
the opiates and painkillers that they're

1417
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:37,989
giving you guys in the NFL

1418
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:39,788
when do they determine that you actually

1419
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:42,009
have a drug problem because they sweeten

1420
00:56:39,789 --> 00:56:44,528
you all these opiates and stuff I mean

1421
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:46,119
and it carries on how does it not until

1422
00:56:44,528 --> 00:56:47,380
you retire cuz the drug problem while

1423
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:49,539
you're playing is a good thing it means

1424
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,309
you're on the field so they have

1425
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:53,259
basically they look at it where hey long

1426
00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:54,999
as you can play it so as you can plan

1427
00:56:53,259 --> 00:56:57,159
you stay out of trouble that that's the

1428
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:58,358
NFL's main thing beyond the field stay

1429
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:01,118
out of trouble so you can stay on the

1430
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:05,318
field thank you I mean it's a political

1431
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:06,789
issue and I think that well you guys may

1432
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:11,318
know that there was a Harvard report

1433
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:14,380
last year about NFL and and pain control

1434
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:19,088
and there were two main conclusions one

1435
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:21,338
that pain and and medical treatment and

1436
00:57:19,088 --> 00:57:23,978
the use of opioids versus cannabis

1437
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:25,748
should not be something that's in the

1438
00:57:23,978 --> 00:57:27,548
collective bargaining agreement it

1439
00:57:25,748 --> 00:57:29,889
shouldn't be something that's negotiated

1440
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:34,288
because it's about health it's not about

1441
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:37,088
you know benefits some sort of selfish

1442
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:39,489
motives on the parts of the players that

1443
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:41,558
was one conclusion the other is that the

1444
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:42,849
physicians who are examining the

1445
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:44,759
patients and the physicians who are

1446
00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:48,568
setting the policy should not be

1447
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:48,568
beholden to the NFL

1448
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:59,789
you actually may have just answered my

1449
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:02,250
question but um I was I was going to ask

1450
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:05,579
how strongly is the opiate usage

1451
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:08,730
encouraged by management staff and if

1452
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:10,500
there were any ramifications for not

1453
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:13,650
taking part in it well it's it's changed

1454
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,570
I mean there's ramifications as far as

1455
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:18,360
your being pain unless you can find an

1456
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:20,160
alternative but the rules have changed

1457
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,450
in the NFL there's they've gotten so

1458
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:23,309
much slack that they've really tightened

1459
00:58:21,449 --> 00:58:24,809
up I mean there's a report out a couple

1460
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:26,519
of weeks ago that they were you know

1461
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:28,139
when you when you give out a controlled

1462
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:29,550
substance you're supposed to take notes

1463
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:31,889
about how much you gave so that you can

1464
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:33,690
track how much someone is taking some

1465
00:58:31,889 --> 00:58:35,819
teams trainers did it some teams did it

1466
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:37,740
but you know there was no oversight I

1467
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:39,870
know when I played and I've been retired

1468
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:41,489
for five years but like I said I carried

1469
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:43,349
the ball so much when we got on the

1470
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:44,609
plane on the ride home trainer would

1471
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:48,900
just come up and give me a little bag

1472
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:50,579
with three vicodin so it just depends on

1473
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:53,220
on the team but the history is that

1474
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:54,389
they've people when players are hurting

1475
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:56,219
and they come and ask for it then

1476
00:58:54,389 --> 00:58:57,960
they're they're giving it and for me I

1477
00:58:56,219 --> 00:59:00,719
didn't have that much experience with

1478
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,099
with opioids just a little vicodin after

1479
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:03,719
the game but for me what concerned me

1480
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:05,909
was the toor dhal and the henderson and

1481
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:07,889
the strong anti-inflammatories that you

1482
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:09,659
pretty much have to take almost every

1483
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:13,409
day to feel to feel like you can go out

1484
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:16,440
and practice I just had two basic

1485
00:59:13,409 --> 00:59:19,109
question um so I've had two severe head

1486
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:22,320
injuries both are definitely severe

1487
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:23,880
concussions one both of them have taken

1488
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,960
care of like some of my long-term memory

1489
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,820
and so forth

1490
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,829
and I've consume cannabis ever since I

1491
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,240
was a child my mother used to use it for

1492
00:59:28,829 --> 00:59:32,039
me when I was in her womb when I had

1493
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,839
colic and when I was born it's been in

1494
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:36,389
my life ever since I you know my whole

1495
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,370
life after my concussions every time I

1496
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:40,319
consumed anything with THC in it I get

1497
00:59:38,369 --> 00:59:42,750
unbelievably wretched headaches and

1498
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,910
there's this aftermath of shakes and

1499
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:47,849
chills and blurred vision and light

1500
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:50,429
stigmatism but I take 120 milligrams of

1501
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:52,949
CBD every day with less than a percent

1502
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:54,389
THC and it you know it doesn't affect

1503
00:59:52,949 --> 00:59:56,129
but have you guys ever noticed any

1504
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:57,230
effects with concussions were THC

1505
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,579
because of the increased blood

1506
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:01,019
vascularity or whatever it may be that's

1507
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:04,789
actually increasing the pressures

1508
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:04,789
causing that type of an effect

1509
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:12,500
myself but the important point of that

1510
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:15,199
is that the individual responds to THC

1511
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:18,260
CBD the plan as a whole is going to be

1512
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:20,239
very particular to an individual and so

1513
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,099
I have no doubt that you're telling the

1514
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:25,098
truth in that it's happening exactly as

1515
01:00:22,099 --> 01:00:26,480
you say but that's the effect on you it

1516
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:27,890
could be completely different for

1517
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:34,400
somebody else with another kind of head

1518
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:36,920
injury yes good afternoon so I'm

1519
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:40,160
wondering have you begun a conversation

1520
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:42,230
with athletic directors high schools or

1521
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:45,139
universities and if you have not how

1522
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:47,990
would you encourage us to go back to our

1523
01:00:45,139 --> 01:00:50,539
local communities to share as parents

1524
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:55,279
and participants in the community

1525
01:00:50,539 --> 01:00:58,579
cannabis activists what is safe healing

1526
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:02,300
practices with cannabis because as Ricky

1527
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:04,069
stated the zero tolerance it ends your

1528
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:08,119
career it happened to me I got kicked

1529
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:11,390
out of swim team and it jeopardizes your

1530
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:13,070
collegiate opportunities and I think

1531
01:01:11,389 --> 01:01:15,559
it's so important that a conversation

1532
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:17,750
begins at that level and if you haven't

1533
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:20,989
started would you be willing to add even

1534
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:23,210
language to your website so that each of

1535
01:01:20,989 --> 01:01:29,179
us can go back to our hometowns and say

1536
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:31,099
oh please look at this yeah the amateur

1537
01:01:29,179 --> 01:01:33,049
the amateur issue is really hard to deal

1538
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:35,269
with with cannabis because you got to be

1539
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:40,849
21 years old to purchase it not in

1540
01:01:35,269 --> 01:01:44,000
Washington State but just advocating it

1541
01:01:40,849 --> 01:01:47,240
in schools is going to run up against a

1542
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,150
lot of opposition I believe so but I

1543
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:51,829
think it should be a parent issue with

1544
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:54,050
if you believe in this product and your

1545
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:55,429
kid is suffering from things that he

1546
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,560
could benefit he or she could benefit

1547
01:01:55,429 --> 01:01:58,940
from the use of CBD then go ahead and

1548
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:01,699
reach out to a doctor who can help you

1549
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:03,230
with that but the amateur stuff is hard

1550
01:02:01,699 --> 01:02:05,809
when it comes to it because I actually

1551
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:08,900
started using it when I was 14 years old

1552
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:10,880
I used it for the first time about a

1553
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,220
month before I had my first concussion

1554
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,010
on the football field so my first

1555
01:02:13,219 --> 01:02:17,838
football injury was a concussion and I

1556
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,700
started using canvas a month before and

1557
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:22,460
my brain feels pretty good

1558
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:23,750
right now and it felt good all along and

1559
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,260
I've never gotten involved with the

1560
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,599
pills

1561
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:28,730
they never sunk in with me I never had

1562
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:30,349
developed a taste for it I believe it's

1563
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:32,358
because I was familiar with the other

1564
01:02:30,349 --> 01:02:34,099
side of the fence with cannabis the

1565
01:02:32,358 --> 01:02:36,739
whole time and I knew it worked for my

1566
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:38,930
body now that's not something that

1567
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:40,669
people are going to be open-minded to a

1568
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:42,949
lot of people in high school is that

1569
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:45,048
it's actually probably helping some high

1570
01:02:42,949 --> 01:02:46,548
school kids out there but I think that's

1571
01:02:45,048 --> 01:02:48,798
down the road I think we need to work on

1572
01:02:46,548 --> 01:02:50,539
changing the scheduling of it D

1573
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:51,739
scheduling rescheduling it before we can

1574
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:54,318
start at the NFL and then it will

1575
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:56,899
trickle down we also need to establish

1576
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:59,659
the difference between underage use when

1577
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:03,160
it's for medicinal versus personal use

1578
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:05,719
so we know that underage use

1579
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:08,179
recreationally if cannabis can be

1580
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:09,558
deleterious to development and I know

1581
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:12,139
not everybody agrees with that but

1582
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:13,819
that's my reading of the data is that

1583
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:15,529
the younger you are and the more you do

1584
01:03:13,818 --> 01:03:16,880
it at a very young age the greater the

1585
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:19,309
chance there's going to be an issue and

1586
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,700
you know with what Nate's saying I mean

1587
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:25,339
I keep starting at 14 I know somebody

1588
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:27,139
who started at 12 or 13 and he just got

1589
01:03:25,338 --> 01:03:30,039
his PhD at Princeton and he's a

1590
01:03:27,139 --> 01:03:33,230
brilliant guy so it's highly variable

1591
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:36,949
what we don't know is what the effect of

1592
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:38,750
medical cannabis is in underage use and

1593
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:41,358
I know Stacey Gruber she's out there

1594
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:44,380
somewhere they're doing research right

1595
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:47,420
now at McLean Hospital on this issue

1596
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:49,460
trying to figure out is it different for

1597
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:51,048
underage users when they're getting it

1598
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,699
for a specific medical reason and

1599
01:03:51,048 --> 01:03:55,579
there's some actually there's some

1600
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:56,808
evidence that it may not but we need

1601
01:03:55,579 --> 01:03:58,849
more research before you make a

1602
01:03:56,809 --> 01:04:00,109
conclusion like that and certainly on on

1603
01:03:58,849 --> 01:04:02,450
that note

1604
01:04:00,108 --> 01:04:04,279
Stacey's actually our next speaker I'd

1605
01:04:02,449 --> 01:04:06,409
love to keep this panel going because

1606
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,180
it's been a wonderful discussion I would

1607
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:09,500
like to thank everyone particularly for

1608
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:12,279
coming out of the closet and helping us

1609
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,280
move the industry
