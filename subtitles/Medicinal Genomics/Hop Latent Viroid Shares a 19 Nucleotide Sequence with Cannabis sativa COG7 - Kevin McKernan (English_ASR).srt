1
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,080
so we're going to go over the the

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,719
molecular biology that's going on with

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,120
hop and viid uh much of what we know

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,959
about hopl and vroid we are assuming

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,000
from what we know about other viroids

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,278
that infect other plants so um there is

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,719
there are some leaps that are being made

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,480
here um but I think you'll find by the

9
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,518
end of this that um they're they're

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,640
beginning to resonate with what we're

11
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:27,239
seeing in other in other plants okay so

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm thankful for zamir actually giving

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,839
you a big background on the bioburden of

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,200
this um what I'm going to try to do is

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,759
describe what we think this is doing in

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,679
the plant and maybe that will guide us

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,960
in a direction of breeding away from

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,519
this problem so this is a picture of

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,200
hopl and vroid sequence through RNA fold

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,640
up there on the upper right uh it's not

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,000
very large it doesn't code for any

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,719
proteins it's just a piece of RNA so

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,119
what the heck is this doing in the plant

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,558
to create such a tremendous uh downfall

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,280
and yield the going hypothesis in other

26
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,399
viroids is that this is acting through

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
an RNA interference pathway it makes so

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,878
much of this RNA that that RNA

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,838
eventually hybridizes to some

30
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,478
transcripts that share sequence hology

31
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:10,560
with it and then some enzymes noin

32
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:13,359
argonot and dicer come in and dice up

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,920
this RNA and as in effect downregulate

34
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,560
the expression of genes that have

35
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,719
sequence homology to hop L and vroid so

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
when we were playing around with

37
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,560
designing primers for for more optimal

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
PCR with this I think it was either Liam

39
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,799
or Steve and our biomatics group blasted

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
this thing against uh the Jamaican lion

41
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,159
genome and came up with all these hits

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,240
saying we probably shouldn't put primers

43
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,719
here uh or we might amplify the Cannabis

44
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,920
genome and have a bad test um and lo and

45
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,478
behold that got us thinking well wait a

46
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,200
minute maybe that's actually

47
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,920
biologically meaningful outside of just

48
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,600
your primer design um maybe this

49
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,719
actually has uh a function going on so

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,399
this is a picture of a hop Laten vroid

51
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:51,919
genome with two mutations in it uh

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,239
compared to the reference that was

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,159
published in 1988 and what happens is

54
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,438
the structure of the vroid completely

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,359
changes I'll show you a comparison in

56
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,959
the next slide but um just to get

57
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,920
yourself a handle on some of the parts

58
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,078
of this VY there's a central controlled

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,038
region in the middle which is uh has two

60
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,000
overlapping quadruplex G structures

61
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,318
those structures are generally We

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,759
Believe ribozymes although this this

63
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,878
particular virid has not been reported

64
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,560
to have any ribosy activity it's still

65
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,598
unknown how this is replicating in the

66
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,000
plant the the belief is that a DNA

67
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,318
dependent RNA polymerase amplifies an

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,318
RNA template which is somewhat um not

69
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,839
very believable but that's the the going

70
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,679
thinking is that a enzyme that's

71
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,560
supposed to replicate DNA

72
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,439
somehow mistakenly replicates RNA into

73
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,759
more RNA and then this creates a long

74
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,840
linear template since this is circular

75
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,120
and that long linear template then gets

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,200
processed into smaller 256 base per

77
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,360
pieces and then re circularized and we

78
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,759
don't know any of the enzymes that are

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,400
doing that right now now what you'll

80
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,199
notice is we've decorated certain

81
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,039
portions of this vroid with the sequence

82
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,598
uh regions where they have homology to

83
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,598
certain genes in the Cannabis genome uh

84
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,399
and uh that's going to become important

85
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:02,479
as we step forward so I mentioned that

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,319
the variance in this can make a very big

87
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,079
impact if you just put two Snips in this

88
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,158
you will see the structure on the left

89
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,680
versus the structure on the right uh

90
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:12,598
this also changes the footprint that it

91
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,879
may have in the Cannabis reference

92
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,518
because we're dealing with very short

93
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:18,479
homologies here just 17 to 25 base par

94
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,879
homologies you switch one or two bases

95
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,359
in some of those regions and it goes to

96
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,840
completely different genes so uh the the

97
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,400
variation we need to keep track of in

98
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,158
the field to make sure that the

99
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,760
pathology of this doesn't shift over

100
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:32,318
time now if you take um all everything

101
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,158
that we found that are 17 bases and

102
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,759
higher there's 25 genes in the Cannabis

103
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,079
genome that this has homology to and it

104
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,959
may have some down regulation uh impact

105
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,040
on so we set out to measure that uh

106
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,598
we're going to touch on that a little

107
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,280
bit later the first part I want to touch

108
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,318
on is how much variation is there in the

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,519
population uh with hop and virid like

110
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:52,039
what are we dealing with are we dealing

111
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,319
with a covid that's like changing every

112
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:57,598
3 months from alpha to to to a nron or

113
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,919
dealing with a fairly consistent vroid

114
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,878
the literature implies this DNA

115
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,719
dependent RNA polymerase should make

116
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:05,399
lots of Errors copying this and so

117
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,919
people believe it's going to be a quas

118
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,719
species which means it's not doesn't

119
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,839
even share the same sequence within one

120
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,519
organism it begins to get heteroplasmic

121
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,479
within an organism we don't know if

122
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,280
that's true I think we're going to show

123
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,120
you some data that suggests we're very

124
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,519
skeptical of that uh this is a site that

125
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,560
we built called vedia uh when people are

126
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,319
are testing their their strains they

127
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
sometimes want to submit their hop lat

128
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,759
and viroid strains into us for

129
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,280
sequencing we sequence them and then put

130
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,879
them public so that we have a mechanism

131
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,799
to track the pandemic throughout the

132
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,759
industry uh and this also does some of

133
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,600
the RNA folding information and then

134
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,038
blasts those those novel variants

135
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,280
against the Cannabis genome to see if

136
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,478
you have any novel RNA locations that

137
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,959
may be at Bay um so it gives you a

138
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:46,879
little painted picture like this you can

139
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,799
see the color coding on the vroid those

140
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,719
are the color codings of the regions in

141
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,319
the genome that they have homology to so

142
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,919
three of the most common genes that we

143
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,639
find it's a gene known as cog7 that's a

144
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,000
gene involved in shoot apil merism

145
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,720
growth there's another one called

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,360
expansin which is involved in cell

147
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,320
development uh and growth and another

148
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,400
one called clasp uh and we'll touch on a

149
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,279
few more of the ones that were in that

150
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,679
long spreadsheet uh so there's there's

151
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,439
many genes that this is potentially

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
interacting with uh what does the

153
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,279
variation look like in ncbi well ncbi

154
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,360
has been collecting information on this

155
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,359
from I want to say late 1980s uh and

156
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,360
there's about 155 genomes in ncbi and

157
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,520
they all vary in length and they all

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,919
vary in uh sequence context dramatically

159
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,279
now uh we've been studying this for

160
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,680
quite a bit uh this is what the picture

161
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,399
looks like of the variation in ncbi and

162
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,759
every one of those white marks on the

163
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,120
sequins are a variant and all the little

164
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,360
dots are areas where there's just no

165
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,840
sequin at all uh this had people worried

166
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,759
that there was a lot of variation in the

167
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,599
length of the thyroid now I I think as

168
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,319
we've come to um study this more we're

169
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,000
recognizing that this is a very

170
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,720
difficult RNA molecule to sequence it's

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,879
a it's a hair pin so it's completely

172
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,240
self-complimentary in most places so

173
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,918
when you go to try and sequence this

174
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,879
even saying or sequencing chokes up on

175
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,359
this and creates a lot of air so I think

176
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,800
a lot of these we're finding are

177
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,160
potentially sequencing air that's that's

178
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,520
occurring trying to sequence this

179
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,199
circular RNA molecule um and instead

180
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,839
what we're seeing as we go about and and

181
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
categorize all these variants is the

182
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,959
vast majority of the variants are what

183
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,160
is known as can 2 so darkart Nursery

184
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,680
when they first came out with this said

185
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,039
we're seeing predominantly two variants

186
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,720
can one and can 2 can one is the is is

187
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:21,918
the the POA reference that was

188
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,400
discovered in hops in the late ' 80s and

189
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,680
can 2 is what they're they're finding in

190
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,038
the United States all the other variants

191
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,639
we see are minor variants uh it's kind

192
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,560
of hard to see in that graph but the

193
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,319
majority of those strains over 130 of

194
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,319
them all have this U 225a change known

195
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,960
as can 2 and the rest of them are a

196
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,720
bunch of uh I would say perhaps

197
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,918
sequencing artifacts or very rare rare

198
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,240
variants many of these variants are

199
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:46,839
actually condensing or consolidating

200
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,360
themselves under primers that have been

201
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,879
published in the literature for people

202
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,120
surveying this so there's probably

203
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,800
something going on with Sanger

204
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,918
sequencing where we get poor sequencing

205
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,199
over the primer sites and we have an a

206
00:06:54,918 --> 00:07:00,000
higher uh increase in error rate on this

207
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,360
now when we chart these from the people

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,079
that send them in this is a

209
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
representation of about 18 different

210
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,758
locations that have sent samples in for

211
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,598
sequencing um these dots on the map

212
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,919
actually represent many many samples

213
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,240
that came from that location for

214
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,279
instance the the work in Massachusetts

215
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,038
uh from feno Express probably represent

216
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,198
stuff from all over New England uh

217
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,639
likewise the darkart is a nursery they

218
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,879
probably are getting samples from all

219
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,639
over California and the pack Northwest

220
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,319
so it's much more diverse and spread

221
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,120
apart than what you're seeing these dots

222
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,919
represent but the important thing is to

223
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,399
see here is can one and can 2 are all

224
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,079
over the world there isn't one

225
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,399
particular pocket of one variant versus

226
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,318
another uh they um they're in China

227
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,878
they're in the pack Northwest and um

228
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,319
they both seem to be spreading um

229
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,680
somewhat equally all right so how do we

230
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,840
validate a test to make sure we can pick

231
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,439
up all this variation uh important thing

232
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,638
is that you have very high sensitivity

233
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,439
but we don't want to confuse that with

234
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,280
specificity if you put primers in the

235
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,399
wrong place on this on this vroid you'll

236
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,638
you can get some background off the

237
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,839
Cannabis genome because there's a lot of

238
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,199
homology to the Cannabis genome uh you

239
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,560
also should have more than two primer

240
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,199
sets because you don't want to put some

241
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,399
of your primer sets on of those variants

242
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,478
and then they don't amplify and you're

243
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:06,079
only surveying can one versus can 2 and

244
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,079
missing any of the rare variants um RNA

245
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,000
tests need a lot more scrutiny DNA is

246
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,800
really easy to predict where your

247
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,639
primers are going to land RNA you can't

248
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,079
really predict where they're going to

249
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,800
land because we don't have complete

250
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,478
surveys of every transcriptome under

251
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,199
every condition out there you end up

252
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,519
with alternate splicing you end up with

253
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,439
circular rnas known as lariats so

254
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,598
getting primers to work in RNA you

255
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,279
really have to test them against real

256
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:27,759
living organisms you can't just do in

257
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,918
silica prediction so we've gone through

258
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,400
and tested this on 50 different organis

259
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,360
that were commonly found in cannabis to

260
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,838
show that they don't interact with that

261
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,000
and we even went through the painstaking

262
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,680
effort of of chemically synthesizing uh

263
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,440
25 different viroids um to prove that we

264
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,799
could hit those as well the reality is

265
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
only a couple of these really matter at

266
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,120
the moment we're not seeing High

267
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,919
prevalence of the other ones in space

268
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,360
third question is what do you survey in

269
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,958
the in the plants and this is actually

270
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,919
something that has evolved over time as

271
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,079
we've learned more about the plant uh

272
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,759
we've been involved in two or three

273
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,959
studies that showed really high CTS in I

274
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,120
should say higher virid loads in the

275
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,879
leaves than in The Roots all right um

276
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,879
we've been in one study where it showed

277
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,919
higher CTS in The Roots where things

278
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,200
were completely missed in the leaves and

279
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,159
I'm going to touch on another study that

280
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,079
we've been doing that shows some plants

281
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,278
that only Harbor this in the roots and

282
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:15,519
they don't even spread it out to the

283
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,838
leaves um and that may actually said

284
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,399
some light on some of the U the

285
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,480
tolerances is having um so at the moment

286
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,440
testing both tissues is probably makes a

287
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,079
lot of sense uh because uh we don't

288
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,880
actually know where this is always going

289
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:31,559
to always going to land um but we what

290
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,559
can we do now that we know about where

291
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,479
the homology is against the Cannabis

292
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,799
Gene and what you're seeing in these

293
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
gray boxes are the regions of the vroid

294
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,319
that have homology to different regions

295
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,360
in the Cannabis genome uh so we can

296
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,920
track for variants when they fall inside

297
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,519
those regions to know that if there's a

298
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,879
new variant circulating maybe this is

299
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,440
changing it's Target in the Cannabis

300
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,120
genome and then we have a Sanger

301
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,079
sequencing program in place to sequence

302
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,679
these things very quickly so that we can

303
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:57,239
survey if there's anything changing um

304
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:59,479
but in addition to this uh we wanted to

305
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,720
ask the question of what is happening

306
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,920
The genome from an RNA perspective when

307
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,519
you infect a plant versus a control

308
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,599
clone do you get different gene

309
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,519
expression and does that gene expression

310
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
to give you uh any sense of the

311
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,440
pathology of the viroid so we took a

312
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,278
Jamaican lion clone this is the mother

313
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,800
plant that we sequenced many years ago

314
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,039
and put the reference public uh this

315
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,078
thing is still circulating uh we're able

316
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,879
to get clones from the mother infect one

317
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,639
now we weren't able to actually infect

318
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,919
this plant we took um some of the advice

319
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,958
from zamir to try to use Q-tips and swab

320
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,679
vroid on on cut leaves and this would

321
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,759
not fact we tried that three times

322
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,639
waiting two weeks between each time and

323
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,000
it would not it would not go positive on

324
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,519
us so we finally broke a branch off the

325
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,078
bottom of a plant and used a p1000 to

326
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,000
inject the virid right into the stem uh

327
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,000
and we did that two weeks later we were

328
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,078
positive in The Roots but nowhere else

329
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,639
um so that was just an oddity we we we

330
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,159
weren't expecting uh now it turns out

331
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,839
throughout the course of this study what

332
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,199
we did is we sampled The Roots we

333
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,800
sampled the leaves we sampled the

334
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
flowers and the mar stems in triplicate

335
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,639
every single week for 10 weeks and

336
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,120
sequence those with over 40 to 50

337
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,959
million reads per sample so this is

338
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,278
about 80 libraries with um terabytes of

339
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,359
sequencing information um and what we're

340
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:11,838
trying to do is track this between

341
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,079
infected and non-infected and what we

342
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,399
saw through the course of time is that

343
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,078
this would continue to be negative when

344
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,519
we're doing you know basically 16 qpcrs

345
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,919
every week across the entire time scale

346
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,959
here this was always negative in the

347
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,479
leaves and only positive in The Roots uh

348
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,000
now what we did start to notice toward

349
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,120
the end of its life cycle is that the

350
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,839
flowers and the leaves just jacked up

351
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,959
the anthy in production okay we don't

352
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,720
know why this could be an immune

353
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,958
response but we're not seeing this as

354
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,639
heavily increased in the in the control

355
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,199
that's not infected all right so uh we

356
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,879
then at we push this Beyond its actual

357
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,399
flowering time and just said let it see

358
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,278
if it dies in The Vine and does it

359
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,000
finally make itself into the leaves like

360
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,278
Let It Go a couple weeks past flowering

361
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,600
and so as we did that we began testing

362
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,679
and every single tissue we tested uh 57

363
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,320
out of 57 of these were negative if the

364
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,559
tissue was purple uh then we found some

365
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,320
parts of the plant that were lower

366
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,719
branches that looked a little scraggly

367
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,360
like you can see there on the on the

368
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,079
upper I guess on your side the upper

369
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:15,079
right um and uh that particular Branch

370
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,399
seven out of seven were positive so to

371
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:18,679
after after flowering time when we

372
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,320
really stress this thing out we could

373
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,679
see a couple of the lower branches get

374
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,440
positive but the top canopy anything

375
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,958
that was purple and had anthro in

376
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,199
production was not testing positive for

377
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,759
us now we don't have good cannaboid

378
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:30,879
measurements on this so can't give you a

379
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,319
good sense of yield other than the

380
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,919
Growers that have handled this thing for

381
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,800
5 years do not see a measurable

382
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,599
Difference by eye of the flower weight

383
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:40,078
in the yield but we we clearly don't

384
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,879
have semms and hlc's on this to confirm

385
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,879
that so uh that that needs to be

386
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,679
probably repeated now that we have an

387
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,000
idea of what this experiment might yield

388
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,198
we didn't go into this anticipating um

389
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,159
this this outcome so there are some some

390
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,479
literature out there that tie virid

391
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,319
infection with increase in flavonoid

392
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,079
production and anthocyan production so

393
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,199
this we aren't the first to find this um

394
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,439
others have have listed genes that they

395
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,359
believe have different transcriptional

396
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,800
um loads when their viroids are

397
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,519
infecting them and they do point back to

398
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,240
flavonoid production we don't know if

399
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,000
this is a defense mechanism uh we don't

400
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,720
know if you know cause and effect here

401
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,600
but it's just an interesting observation

402
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,680
that um these may be playing a role

403
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,079
what's going on okay so if you're not

404
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,479
familiar with these types of plots these

405
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,919
are integrated genome viewers these are

406
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,639
plots of sequencing read coverage across

407
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,360
particular transcripts and so what we

408
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,159
wanted to see is is this RNA happening

409
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,879
like if are we going to see down

410
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,439
regulation of particular genes that have

411
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,439
homology to hopl and viroid and when we

412
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,480
scan across a few of these uh we can

413
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,199
certainly see in this case it's cog7 we

414
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,360
can see the ones that are hlv infected

415
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,479
there's a there's a decrease in in um

416
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,360
expression but note the decrease in

417
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,480
expression is only over that short

418
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,240
window of where there's interaction with

419
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,680
the virus the entire transcript isn't

420
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,799
gone it's just knocking out those that

421
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,679
particular region of the transcript this

422
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,278
was also seen in uh the clasp Gene we

423
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,559
can see some down regulation of the

424
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:02,360
window where there's ology to hlvd but

425
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,919
it does not kill the entire transcript

426
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,039
um still don't know what that means it's

427
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,559
just an interesting observation it's a

428
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,240
bit more of a global picture of this I'm

429
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,758
sorry that the fonts there aren't aren't

430
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,159
very helpful for you but you can see

431
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,600
that there this is differential gene

432
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,039
expression on on the 25 different genes

433
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,199
I had in that initial table and across

434
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,879
uh a variety of samples that are

435
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,958
infected versus non-infected in leaves

436
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,278
in Roots and in tissue um and if I could

437
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,838
do a better job with the laser here I'd

438
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,519
point out to you some features here but

439
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,079
what is happening is on the left side is

440
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,240
predominantly samples that are not

441
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,919
infected and on the right side are

442
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,079
samples that are infected and we're

443
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,958
still kind of combing through what all

444
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,359
this means but there does seem to be

445
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,319
some trends for changes in gene

446
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,120
expression um based on infection and

447
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,480
non- infection uh in in in tissue

448
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,519
specific as well so one question people

449
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,199
ask is you have this much RNA sequencing

450
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,078
data uh what is did you pick up any hopl

451
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,919
virid in there and we did we shouldn't

452
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,359
have because we used polya capture to do

453
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,000
this but some of the virid is at such

454
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,320
high concentration it comes through we

455
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,919
sequence it and it's all the same so

456
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,440
there is an Aquas a species thing going

457
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,679
on in this plant it's one clonal copy of

458
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,759
H hplvd across all the tissues that we

459
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:09,399
found it in um the other thing that

460
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,839
happens when you start looking for this

461
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,440
um type of contamination or I should say

462
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,680
sequence in there um is you begin asking

463
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,720
about the canabus variation so we have a

464
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,599
large database of 1834 genomes now that

465
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,680
we can then ask this question are there

466
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,600
variations underneath these hplvd

467
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:29,318
targets that may change the way this RNA

468
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,240
interference behaves um and in fact this

469
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:33,439
gives you kind of a picture of COG 7 all

470
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,278
the Snips down there at the bottom track

471
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,600
you can see it's this is a densely

472
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,120
covered area there's a snip probably

473
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,278
every 50 bases in our database so uh if

474
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,480
if you're dealing with you know 25 Ms

475
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,159
you're going to find some Snips in the

476
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,480
neighborhood of these things uh and

477
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,278
that's in fact the case so this is a

478
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,000
look uh an alignment of COG 7 across

479
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,159
just a window of some of the cultivars

480
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,240
that are in the canopia database and you

481
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,639
can see there are variants that exist in

482
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,600
the target of homology for hplvd these

483
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,120
would be nice targets to basically breed

484
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,959
and then challenge to see if they

485
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,440
actually have uh A reduced phenotype of

486
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,239
uh or or loss of loss of yield we can

487
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,759
see the same thing in the clasp Gene as

488
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,318
well you can March through every one of

489
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,959
these Gene targets and you can see that

490
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:15,240
there are variants that exist out in the

491
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,399
population that alter the footprint for

492
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,879
hplvd and they're they're candidates for

493
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,120
potential genetic um tolerance I would

494
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,958
say to this virus or viroid now you got

495
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,198
to keep in mind um the way this thing

496
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,838
replicates is we're not going to get

497
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,799
resistance it will probably get into a

498
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,600
plant and replicate but it may not have

499
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:35,120
RNA interference capacity to shut down

500
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,480
the the the the actual pathology or the

501
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,198
growth of the plant but it may still be

502
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,519
PCR positive uh this is what we've seen

503
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,758
in the Hop industry The Hop industry's

504
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,198
have this problem for 40 years it's

505
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,079
never gone away now that we know from

506
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,719
zamir that there seed transmission maybe

507
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:48,198
pollen transmission there's paper

508
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,120
suggesting viroids move in fungal

509
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:51,679
mycelium that they can move in fusarium

510
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,720
spores we're not going to you're not

511
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,758
going to bleach your way out of this

512
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,120
problem we're going to have to breed our

513
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,318
way out of the problem and that I think

514
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,440
is what has happened in the hot field

515
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:01,120
they have found cultivars up there that

516
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,720
just have reduced loss in secondary

517
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,720
metabolites they're not they're not

518
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,480
perfect but they they they take it from

519
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,558
being 40% loss down to like 5% loss and

520
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,959
then they work with those um now and

521
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,279
part of this discovery when you sequence

522
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,519
all the RNA and something is you find

523
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,119
out something that blows your entire

524
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,720
experiment apart and that is one of the

525
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,639
plants we were working with had cucumber

526
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,480
mosaic virus in it uh so this has never

527
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,280
been found in cannabis before and we now

528
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,120
have a good sequence of its genome it is

529
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,960
in fact in cannabis however its tissue

530
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,000
tropism is different while we're finding

531
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,480
hplvd in The Roots predominantly in our

532
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,519
plants this thing is not in the roots

533
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,240
it's in the other tissues uh and it's a

534
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,558
lot more polymorphic inside these

535
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,240
tissues than hop Len viroid all right

536
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,038
this has a snip almost every 20 bases

537
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,599
inside of its genome and it was

538
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,879
different enough that the primers we

539
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,558
designed to Target cucumber mosaic virus

540
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,240
off of other plants don't work on the V

541
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,158
the virus that's in the cannabis plant

542
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,798
it has mutated itself on its you know Z

543
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,320
zoonotic Quest into cannabis uh to be so

544
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:01,720
different that we've had to redesign

545
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,558
primers for this so um this infects

546
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,839
12200 plants this is this is goes

547
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,158
everywhere so this shouldn't be a

548
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:09,079
surprise to anybody it is in fact a quas

549
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:10,760
species it tends to be about 95%

550
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,319
identical to references when you find it

551
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:15,759
in in cannabis so um this is another one

552
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:16,918
that we should keep an eye on I can't I

553
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,000
don't think I can go backwards on this

554
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,600
can I I can so you'll notice some of

555
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,400
those leaves and upper lip picture that

556
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,879
we missed you can see a little bit of a

557
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,480
mosaic pattern there I think that's

558
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,520
what's going on is that plant actually

559
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,120
had CMV in it as we can detect but we

560
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,839
just didn't you know make not of those

561
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,678
we probably you know blame that on

562
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,759
something else and uh here we are so I

563
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,120
think I've got enough time but so in

564
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,919
conclusions um we don't see evidence of

565
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,879
hoped being a quasi species although

566
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,080
literature suggest otherwise but we're

567
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,440
just not seeing it from the sequencing

568
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,918
we've been doing please send in samples

569
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,159
we'll sequence more and track this for

570
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,480
the for the industry because it's going

571
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,200
to be important in case it does mutate

572
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,440
um some of the plants can keep hlv in

573
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,120
the roots and remain relatively

574
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,120
asymtomatic this is important if you're

575
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,439
going to cut and kill every plant that's

576
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:59,038
positive only in The Roots You might

577
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,400
lose the plants that are in fact most

578
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,839
tolerant to get us out of this so I

579
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,919
understand if you have you have

580
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,959
something like this in your grow you got

581
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,440
to clean everything out however uh in

582
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,720
the process of doing so um be aware of

583
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,200
this you might want an isolation room

584
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,919
where you can find the plants that have

585
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,279
very low viroid load and start greeing

586
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,159
with those and keep them away from your

587
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,720
facilities uh where you're doing your

588
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,400
production because that might be a

589
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,919
better long-term plan than just being on

590
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,960
a PCR treadmill the rest of your life um

591
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,679
there are phenotypes of CMV and hplvd

592
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,679
overlap we have to keep that in mind we

593
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,480
need to do more screening for CMV to see

594
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,759
what's out there um in sequencing some

595
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,480
of the mothers and the varies we think

596
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:34,319
can provide you a long-term strategy for

597
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,759
how to breed your way through this so I

598
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,879
think with that I'm going to skip over

599
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,679
the end of these slides and just thank

600
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,720
these people for uh for helping us out

601
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,880
in all this work I'll take questions

602
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,880
thank

603
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,319
you we might be short on time for

604
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:58,559
questions yeah okay he's giving me the

605
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:58,558
hook all right I'll be at lunch
