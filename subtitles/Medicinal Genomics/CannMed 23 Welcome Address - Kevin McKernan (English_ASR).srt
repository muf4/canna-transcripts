1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,660
well good morning everybody I hope

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,300
everyone's well hydrated after last

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,638
night's dinner uh seemed to be I think I

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,500
lost five pounds on that but

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:14,638
um I'm Kevin mckernan I'm from medicinal

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,259
genomics

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,019
um we've been hosting this conference I

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,760
can't remember how long maybe six years

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,278
um but I do want to spend some time

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,320
today dwelling on this uh this concept

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,839
of of welcome

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,000
it's imperative in science right now as

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,820
uh we reflect on the welcoming of all

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,039
these you know different ideas a can Med

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,480
everyone is welcome here we we have an

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,640
exceptional diversity of international

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,398
attendees we thank you for traveling as

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,140
far as you have uh this this really does

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,299
make it a better conference when we have

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,878
opinions from all over the world

21
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,099
um so we are officially now uh post

22
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,659
pandemic I think as of last week which

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,539
is quite refreshing and we can think of

24
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:57,659
no better place to kick this off uh than

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,520
at the former hotel where we had planned

26
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,839
the Human Genome Project so many of you

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,579
may not be aware but this is a

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,379
conference that was held for probably 20

29
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,359
years on these beaches and in these

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,978
hallways where we had planned out and

31
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,659
mapped out how to sequence the Human

32
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:13,200
Genome Project it was a it was a

33
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,880
conference known as uh agbt so many of

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,920
the names like Francis Collins and Kerry

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,739
Mullis Eric Lander John saltston Bob

36
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,439
Waterston and sometimes Craig Venter was

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,298
allowed to come and we would hash out

38
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,459
how we were going to tackle uh the

39
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,500
Genome Project here and much of the Next

40
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,118
Generation sequencing Revolution that

41
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,859
occurred was actually mapped out down

42
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,500
there at Quinn's Beach Bar

43
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,578
so a lot of history here and I think

44
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,780
it's an important history because I

45
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,578
think we were embarking on a very

46
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,320
similar scale of a project here this is

47
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,599
really like a human cannabinoid project

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,699
we have so much to learn about what's

49
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,919
going on with hundreds if not thousands

50
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,740
of compounds and how these things can

51
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,180
potentially interact with uh with all

52
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:52,920
the different receptors we're finding

53
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,360
the activity with so

54
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,978
so whether you think this pandemic's

55
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,140
over or not we welcome you and whether

56
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,239
you think masks work Ivermectin works

57
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,399
hydroxychloric and works vaccines work

58
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,438
we don't care we welcome you we want all

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,118
of these diverse ideas here to be

60
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,519
discussed because they are starting to

61
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,379
touch on the endocannabinoid system

62
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,060
uh this controversy is something I think

63
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,859
we should embrace investigate as we're

64
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,719
also aware how politics can distort the

65
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,879
scientific consensus on any given topic

66
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,300
and how long that has taken to reverse

67
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:23,459
on on the topic of cannabinoids uh what

68
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,800
we are care about here at kanbad is just

69
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,780
open and in-person dialogues over very

70
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,280
nuanced topics what we know that what

71
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,020
the brighter future lies is with people

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,539
with different scientific views meeting

73
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,239
in person communicating brainstorming

74
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,098
and collaborating and what we can sense

75
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,519
the the dimmer future is going to be is

76
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:43,679
one of an algorithmically controlled

77
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,480
Zoom meeting LinkedIn Facebook YouTube

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,819
all of these things that we know can

79
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,598
have third parties that can be

80
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:53,399
influenced censored and if not uh

81
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:55,259
completely distorted

82
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,939
so while these social media platforms

83
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,259
can certainly connect us they can just

84
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,419
as easily isolate Us in different

85
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:03,120
factions ever arguing over smaller

86
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,378
details and I think if many of you can

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,060
remember the history in the Cannabis

88
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:07,859
field if William Randolph Hearst were

89
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,300
live today he'd probably own a social

90
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,060
media company

91
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,439
uh I I think you'd uh yeah and

92
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,479
regardless of whether you think Elon

93
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,340
Musk is going to you know handle these

94
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,018
Powers better or worse I think everyone

95
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,580
here can agree that it's very dangerous

96
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,319
for governments to launder First

97
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,819
Amendment violations or journalistic

98
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,780
censorship through the companies they

99
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:26,939
regulate

100
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,439
they can manufacture consent for war

101
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,359
outside our borders they can easily

102
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,039
manufacture this to civil discords

103
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,620
inside our own borders with these types

104
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,419
of new tools so we can't have them

105
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,340
camouflaging dictates the scientific

106
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,780
consensus and otherwise science will

107
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,719
become nothing more than this marketing

108
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,158
message or political campaign slogan you

109
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,098
know ever ever more political intrusions

110
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,079
into our lives so uh it's very important

111
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:51,060
that we we give this tremendous scrutiny

112
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,560
this gives them a tremendous amount of

113
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,360
narrative control and the canvas

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,280
industry is uniquely aware of how long

115
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,739
that type of narrative control can take

116
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,860
to reverse

117
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,539
so um just to give you some sense of the

118
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,819
last few years you know when the entire

119
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,199
world focuses on one problem and often

120
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:09,060
comes at the expense of a more sound

121
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,979
allocation of resources we have seen

122
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,598
addictions and overdoses go through the

123
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:14,098
roof in the last few years and it's

124
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,099
something the Cannabis Community knows

125
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:20,219
you know how to chip in on if you look

126
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,979
at in PubMed in SARS cov2 there's over

127
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,680
200 000 Publications for SARS kovi 2

128
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:28,800
since 2020. there's only 32 000

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,600
Publications for cannabis since 1840.

130
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,360
all right so this is a tremendous

131
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,560
torrent of information

132
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,479
that you can choose your own adventure

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,418
view through frankly when this much

134
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,719
information comes raging through uh into

135
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:45,240
the into ncbi into PubMed no one has

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,380
read 100 of the literature all right so

137
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,780
you can walk your way through the

138
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,159
coveted literature and be 100 right with

139
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,599
the position that you have and someone

140
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,180
else can go through that same literature

141
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,860
on a different path and be 100 right

142
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,360
and the way we're going to resolve these

143
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,639
differences is in person I don't think

144
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,319
it's going to happen through Zoom so we

145
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,060
very much cherish people coming to

146
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,978
Scientific conferences like this to

147
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,319
discuss an idea bridge and bring these

148
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:09,779
things together I I personally feel

149
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,759
we're witnessing a scientific Schism

150
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,258
right now very analogous to the

151
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,319
Gutenberg printing press and the

152
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,759
Protestant Revolution Reformation

153
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:21,240
mainly around this pandemic we have very

154
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,160
divided opinions on on what to do with a

155
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,439
situation like this in the printing

156
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,060
press was power and people tried to

157
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,339
centralize that power

158
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,079
I think the best antidote to this

159
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,179
temptation is to further decentralize

160
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,219
scientific communication and can Med is

161
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,019
just one node on that network of

162
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,880
scientists and and Physicians trying to

163
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,680
pursue truth so the more that we can

164
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,478
disinterm mediate third parties that

165
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,180
regulate our speech the better we can be

166
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,639
I think an invention and uh in figuring

167
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,439
out what we can do with the ECS

168
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,060
when the world needs us right now we are

169
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,279
now seeing more evidence of the

170
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,740
importance of the ECS in in treating

171
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,418
coven and we're well aware of many of

172
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,120
the comorbidities in covid having

173
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:02,099
cannabinoid links right we've seen COPD

174
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,680
as being a major comorbidity and we know

175
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,780
that there's cannabis oil activity there

176
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,038
cancer thrombosis there's a host of

177
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:09,659
these things if we could treat the

178
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:12,120
comorbidities we could probably knock

179
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,160
the pandemic off the map of day one but

180
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,620
that didn't happen so as we stand here

181
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,539
today Ireland is advocating medical

182
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,280
misinformation laws under the guise of

183
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,500
eliminating hate speech we have similar

184
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,538
things going on in Australia

185
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,100
um to give you a few cases and you don't

186
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:27,599
have to agree with these Physicians but

187
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,000
you can perhaps sympathize with how

188
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,800
their position could become you Dr sucre

189
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,180
at bhakti is being tried next week in

190
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,740
Germany for speaking out about the

191
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,120
pandemic and they're guising this in the

192
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,280
terms of hate speech

193
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,319
we have Thomas binder who was actually

194
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,239
committed to a psych ward and forced to

195
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,280
take psychiatric medicine because of his

196
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,720
position on on Ivermectin or

197
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,219
hydroxychloroquine I don't know which

198
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,620
one he spoke out about but this is in

199
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,660
Switzerland he's a physician in Internal

200
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,879
Medicine practicing for 24 years and had

201
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,199
a doctorate in immunology and virology I

202
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,899
think his voice was probably worth

203
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,300
hearing so you may disagree with the

204
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,038
with these Physicians have said

205
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,720
but I hope that you reflect that this

206
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,538
persecution can easily be turned on us

207
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,120
the Cannabis field is does not have a

208
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:12,060
consensus at least not in the mainstream

209
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,100
Arena this is quite often stigmatized uh

210
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,079
and certainly this these Physicians here

211
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,259
are saving lives so this is something I

212
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,300
hope we can all take some reflection on

213
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,620
but we are a group of Sciences and

214
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,840
Physicians that have also seen this

215
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,000
movie before we know the importance of

216
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,978
outside of the box thinking in medicine

217
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,439
truth isn't going to be declared from a

218
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:32,699
high it's a generated spontaneously with

219
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,098
diverse ideas

220
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,500
uh and with people interacting I think

221
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:40,019
in person so let's make Ken Med that

222
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,538
place I thank you for coming welcome to

223
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:45,180
Marco Island with that I have no the

224
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,219
great honor of uh introducing you a

225
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,259
person who has committed his career to

226
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,360
reversing inaccurate information about

227
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,020
cannabis and that is Dr Ethan Russo

228
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,020
thank you
