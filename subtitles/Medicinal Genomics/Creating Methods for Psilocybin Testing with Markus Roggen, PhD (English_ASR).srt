spent the past two years developing

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,038
analytical methods for psilocybin and

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,800
other psychedelics which is an emerging

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,519
medicinal industry that's following in

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,000
the footsteps of the cannabis industry

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,640
during our conversation we discuss

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,520
how the regulations in canada make it

56
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,759
more favorable for psychedelic research

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,599
what does psilocybin medicine look like

58
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,679
and how is it created

59
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,639
whether psilocybin will become a

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,360
mass-market recreational product

61
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,518
how psilocybin analytics differs from

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,760
cannabinoid analytics

63
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,360
the difference between psilocybin and

64
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,120
celosin

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,200
what types of impurities and

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
contaminants are a concern with

67
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,199
psilocybin products

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,680
the process of discovering new

69
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,039
tryptamine compounds in psychedelic

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,519
mushrooms

71
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,679
in the future research projects that

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,560
marcus is working on including looking

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,640
at psilocybin extraction and optimal

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,158
storage conditions

75
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,238

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,438
good afternoon marcus thanks for joining

96
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,518
us

97
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,039
thank you for having me

98
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,519
all right so

99
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:14,639
psilocybin seems to be the next big

100
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,319
thing in natural medicine states they're

101
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,959
beginning to allow it to be used for a

102
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,279
variety of conditions and i think most

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,680
experts expect it will follow a similar

104
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,599
path to cannabis where eventually

105
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,840
psilocybin products will be sold in

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,160
dispensaries to qualified patients and

107
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,198
perhaps one day it'll also be available

108
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,439
for adult use but before any of that can

109
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,879
happen there needs to be proper testing

110
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,759
and that's what i want to talk with you

111
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,879
about

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
so first

113
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,120
marcus please tell the people a bit

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,759
about who you are what you do and how

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,160
you got involved in psilocybin testing

116
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,840
okay um so again thank you for having me

117
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,880
and sure i'm happy to

118
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,799
answer the questions that i can from a

119
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,240
chemistry background so

120
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,240
and chemistry background here is the

121
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,918
name of the game i have a phd in

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,038
chemistry

123
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,120
uh

124
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,279
which the academic career eventually

125
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,000
brought me to north america

126
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,478
uh where i then started the cannabis

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,720
industry so you ask it about how did i

128
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,519
get to psilocybin or

129
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,440
psychedelic compounds like most people

130
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,639
in the industry nowadays they came from

131
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,918
cannabis

132
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,680
so i

133
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,198
had

134
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,038
built and operated a research laboratory

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,960
for cannabis

136
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,599
in canada

137
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,959
so we were licensed by health canada do

138
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,720
cannabis research we were associated or

139
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,279
friendly with the university of british

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,199
columbia and vancouver and we did a lot

141
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,679
of weird and wonderful research so how

142
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,600
did i get to psychedelics

143
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,879
health canada carved out a licensing

144
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,520
pathway to do

145
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,959
a psychedelic research in a legal

146
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,918
framework

147
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,560
so

148
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,519
um things that lots of people uh lots of

149
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,720
people in north in the us cannot ex uh

150
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,120
imagine

151
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,039
that uh the compound of interest is

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,639
legal you can use a credit card to order

153
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:12,560
it on the internet and get it sent by

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,680
the canadian mail or by the mail to you

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,120
that is

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,720
possible in canada so here we are and we

157
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,439
are able to work with cannabis

158
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,400
psychedelic compounds

159
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,360
and do a lot of process research and

160
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,758
analytical research

161
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,319
and now in canada the regulations is

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,879
that is it opened up mainly for research

163
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,479
or can you know consumers go online in

164
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,159
in place an order

165
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,719
for cannabis yes

166
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,560
so a cannabis is recreationally legal

167
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,840
right so the

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
um

169
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,679
provincial government so like the state

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,839
governments in the us

171
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,639
they have opened web stores

172
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,638
so i would go to the web store of the

173
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
british columbia

174
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,680
government

175
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,198
and order cannabis and then i get sent

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,120
to me

177
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,280
that is not the case for psychedelics so

178
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,680
psychedelics

179
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,239
have been carved out under a regulation

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,000
aspect of

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
like experimental drug

182
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
that

183
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,840
when

184
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,318
initially it was only medical trials on

185
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,839
psychedelic compounds so pure psilocybin

186
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,000
synthesized um there are i think

187
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,239
a handful of trials on actual

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,279
psychedelic mushrooms and then other

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,079
psychedelic compounds like mdma

190
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,959
and

191
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,399
uh

192
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,079
if

193
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,079
the canadian government or the health

194
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,240
canada authorities

195
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,079
approve a clinical trial

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,519
um so obviously you need your patients

197
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,000
for it you need your doctors you need

198
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,399
your protocols for it

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,240
that's all well and good but

200
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,839
the canadian government realizes we also

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,720
need the supply of the material so

202
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,038
therefore they started licensing

203
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,599
producers to to make psychedelic

204
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,038
mushrooms to synthesize psilocybin or to

205
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,719
make other

206
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,719
psychedelic drugs like mdma

207
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,638
and then there's the the third carve out

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,720
which is a research license under which

209
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,000
we are operating for now

210
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,160
that

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,160
there need to be outside testing or

212
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,120
analytics development

213
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,120
and that's that's the part we are doing

214
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,439
got it so as it stands right now as a

215
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,918
patient the only way you kind of are

216
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,639
getting legal access to psilocybin is if

217
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,639
you're enrolled in one of these trials

218
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:37,360
yes that was true

219
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:40,240
and the only pathway until january 2022

220
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,560
and then the health canada authorities

221
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,360
expanded it into

222
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,000
that

223
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,440
for specific complicated cases

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,159
one doctor

225
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,480
could get one patient

226
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,679
onto psychedelic treatments

227
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
okay

228
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,319
so

229
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,039
there is now in addition to the clinical

230
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,160
trials which are larger take longer

231
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:07,439
um you can now get uh treated as an

232
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,439
individual patient with psychedelics

233
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,839
got it okay so that's a good that's a

234
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,120
good foundation for us to build on here

235
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,880
so

236
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,959
when we're look when you're looking at

237
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,519
analyzing these

238
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,039
these um these products what are we

239
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,360
actually looking at like how are these

240
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,360
products created um i think you had

241
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,800
mentioned like is it a synthesized or an

242
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,120
extracted single compound of psilocybin

243
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,120
or are the mushrooms actually ground up

244
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,120
and put at a capsules are our patients

245
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,799
actually eating the mushrooms like we

246
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
did in college like how how is that

247
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,278
happening

248
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,959
uh

249
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,838
i don't know about

250
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:46,399
eating mushrooms straight up in the

251
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,120
clinical trial setting or individual

252
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,839
patient side but otherwise all of the

253
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,839
above

254
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:00,560
so there are producers in canada and

255
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,759
then importers into canada that would uh

256
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,559
bring

257
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,240
or make available psychedelic mushrooms

258
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,439
that are grown

259
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,320
those are mostly milled into powders and

260
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,200
then

261
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,959
given in capsules

262
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,160
most of the

263
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,518
canadian based mushroom growers we work

264
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,838
with

265
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
or we are in contact with they are still

266
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,600
in a research phase they are still

267
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
trying to find out which mushrooms they

268
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,680
actually want to grow large for

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,839
production they are trying to to find

270
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,399
the right

271
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,480
uh

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,078
strains or cultivars

273
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
to produce i think strains is actually

274
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:42,719
the more correct term in the mushroom

275
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,440
world than it is in the cannabis world

276
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,600
side note so

277
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,480
they are very early there and like

278
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
finding the right mushroom they want

279
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,200
and then

280
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,099
aside from the milled powdered mushroom

281
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
you see

282
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,720
[Music]

283
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,040
basically exclusively in medical trials

284
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,278
pure synthesized

285
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,000
psilocybin or other psychedelic

286
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,078
compounds like mdma

287
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,679
those are synthesized

288
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,679
in the chemistry lab from scratch

289
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,958
that doesn't make any difference between

290
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,519
psilocybin from the mushroom or

291
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,599
psilocybin synthesized same molecule so

292
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,799
there's no difference

293
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,519
it is the impurity profile that you get

294
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,599
when you consume a mushroom that

295
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,679
could be of concern or of benefit right

296
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,278
we're talking into rush effect here as

297
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,278
we know it from the cannabis world if

298
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,240
that exists in mushrooms

299
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:43,679
i don't know we don't know yet

300
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,000
more work needs to be done

301
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,719
and the question is there extraction

302
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,360
going on yes there is

303
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,040
have they really made it onto the the

304
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,240
market of clinical trials

305
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,278
not really no it's very early

306
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,440
um

307
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,120
there are

308
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,519
it seems like all the mushroom growers

309
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,399
and in bc and alberta

310
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,320
um

311
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,278
where also all the cannabis growers used

312
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,720
to be

313
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:16,320
but um so i know of one company here

314
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,240
near vancouver that has developed their

315
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,278
own extraction methods and supposedly

316
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,278
there they're very good

317
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,320
and that is an interesting aspect

318
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,159
but in your intro you made me said maybe

319
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
psychedelics or

320
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,480
psilocybin mushrooms might become a

321
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,639
recreational product in the future

322
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,639
i highly doubt that

323
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,000
i highly doubt that yes there is a

324
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:45,680
recreational use already

325
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,679
in the subcultures

326
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,159
but

327
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,120
i don't see the value proposition of a

328
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,719
mushroom trip for

329
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
um

330
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,440
a social gathering

331
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,040
true

332
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,040
what about something like micro dosing

333
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:06,319
and psychedelics have such a strong

334
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:09,519
medical potential um on the

335
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,000
psychological side that i'm i'm not sure

336
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,519
that it's actually recreation

337
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
that it can be a mass-market

338
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,879
recreational product like cannabis can

339
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,800
be

340
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,480
because intoxication is a psychological

341
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,479
effect

342
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,560
uh

343
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,240
intoxication could be like a subgroup of

344
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,239
psychedelics

345
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,639
and now i'm getting properly slammed by

346
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,759
by professionals in that field

347
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,159
but

348
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,720
psychedelic compounds are so much more

349
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,879
so i i have a problem seeing that as a

350
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,839
mass market product but it's it's a it

351
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,240
has a

352
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,519
maybe it has a stronger claim to fame

353
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,639
for medical

354
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,000
product than cannabis has

355
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,000
you mentioned microdosing

356
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,479
i saw a really really good study from

357
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,679
late last year that compared microdosing

358
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,159
to the

359
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,599
placebo effect and it were the same

360
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,559
numbers

361
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,959
so they they sent

362
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,278
capsules to

363
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,359
study participants

364
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,759
and they had to use these

365
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,720
capsules and then report back

366
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,360
and it was it was a crossover so

367
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,440
some got the placebo first and then the

368
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,360
mushroom others got the mushroom first

369
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,800
and then the placebo

370
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,600
or micro dosing mushroom

371
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,679
and then some of them were told

372
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,440
if it was the placebo or the mushroom

373
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,399
and others were not told were not

374
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,880
informed and it correlated stronger to

375
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,120
the information

376
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,519
than to the

377
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,360
than to the the mushroom itself so if

378
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,240
the people thought it was the mushroom

379
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,320
they felt an effect way more than people

380
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,759
that were not informed and consumed the

381
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,839
mushroom so

382
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,360
it's an interesting study obviously it's

383
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,240
one

384
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,560
you will be able to find your reference

385
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
that can claim that microdosing works

386
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,199
but

387
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,919
i

388
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:13,759
think it's

389
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,639
unlikely to it's still not conclusive

390
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,759
i

391
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,399
yeah

392
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,480
yeah no that's that's interesting

393
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,559
i hope you could uh send us the link to

394
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,159
that study i'd like to include it in the

395
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,078
notes here for anyone

396
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,799
i will dig it out after this interview

397
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,399
yes

398
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,559
all right so going back to the different

399
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,958
forms that these products can come into

400
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,638
um so you as a researcher or you as

401
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,159
someone who's analyzing these different

402
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,159
products do

403
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,399
you know are there unique challenges to

404
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,639
the different ways that these can be uh

405
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,559
produced

406
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,480
um what do you mean with uh how they can

407
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,479
be produced oh so if it's psychedelic if

408
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,240
it's a synthesized versus a

409
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,440
grown part if that is problem for us

410
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,278
analyzing correct so yes there is but

411
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,079
before we even get there there is the

412
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,838
problem of analyzing okay

413
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,758
so

414
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,279
um

415
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,079
quick summary

416
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,078
chemical analysis works by you are

417
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,719
getting your compound of interest into

418
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,198
solution and then this this solution is

419
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,680
injected into analytical instrument for

420
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:20,319
psychedelics as for cannabinoids it's an

421
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,319
hplc so liquid chromatograph

422
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,560
so the hp has a high pressure liquid

423
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,560
chromatograph the idea is that you let

424
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,439
your compound of interest flow along a

425
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,919
tube

426
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,800
so flow it's in a liquid flows along a

427
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,599
tube

428
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,679
uh this that tube is packed with with a

429
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,680
solid phase

430
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:43,758
i want you beforehand pore shell c18

431
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,919
so basically it's a packing material and

432
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,000
then the the component of interest has a

433
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,078
like sticks to the packing material but

434
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
it also sticks to the solvent and so

435
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,599
it's the ratio between stickiness to the

436
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,639
packing material the solid phase whether

437
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,959
it's the the mobile phase the liquid

438
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,480
ensures it comes along flows along the

439
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,559
column comes out the other end and is

440
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,838
detected by your detector which is often

441
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:08,078
an optical detector

442
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,480
so that's how it works

443
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:13,599
and then you compare the time of the

444
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,599
signal you see versus this time the the

445
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,159
compound that it should be is and if

446
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,719
it's the same time then the area of the

447
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,959
signal is your concentration

448
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,720
so you just did the first two years of

449
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,558
chemistry

450
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,240
but to get further so

451
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,960
we know this all from from cannabis

452
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,599
chemistry and and from camera cannabis

453
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,079
analytics and we see cannabis

454
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,199
laboratory switching over or adding

455
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:43,759
psychedelic testing uh simon testing

456
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,759
there's just way one main problem

457
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,960
cannabinoids thc are fat soluble and

458
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,038
they're not water soluble

459
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,240
so all the methods are optimized that

460
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,919
fatty compounds come out like after five

461
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,480
to ten minutes

462
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,799
and all the super polar things

463
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,759
like sugar for example would come out

464
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:08,000
very quickly at like a half a minute

465
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:10,720
psilocybin is extremely water soluble

466
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,960
and not fat soluble at all

467
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,759
so all the instrumentation you have or

468
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,360
the solid phases uh in your columns you

469
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,000
have

470
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:23,119
have your psilocybin wash out with your

471
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,079
injection solvent peak like it takes it

472
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,159
takes

473
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,399
less than a second

474
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,440
to get your signal out with with the

475
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,480
injection

476
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,038
signal

477
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,960
so it like it runs through your column

478
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,038
so quick that you have no way of like

479
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,480
separating it measuring it really

480
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,000
analyzing it

481
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,160
so you have to switch to different

482
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,599
column chemistry

483
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,440
we use helic

484
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,399
which is a normal phase so the fat

485
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,558
compounds come out first and the water

486
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,840
com water soluble compounds come out

487
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:55,599
last

488
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:58,720
so that's that's the heli column we use

489
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,199
but then in addition psilocybin is a

490
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
molecule that is normally present as a

491
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
twitter ion

492
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,279
so

493
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:10,240
uh the psilocybin has two

494
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,759
groups on it and its molecule one likes

495
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,839
to be positively charged and the other

496
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,480
one likes to be negatively charged and

497
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,319
so they can actually exchange proton so

498
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,839
that they can be both charges at the

499
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:24,319
same time in the same molecule

500
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,558
and if you add a little bit of acid then

501
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,079
the molecule will all be positively

502
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:32,079
charged if you add a little bit of base

503
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,079
then it's overall negatively charged

504
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,440
and that's

505
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,558
just around

506
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,480
neutral conditions

507
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,399
your molecule

508
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,240
can come out in three different ionic

509
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,080
states

510
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,079
neutral as its vitamin positive or

511
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,000
negative

512
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,879
and it does that

513
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,440
in most of the cases of the standard

514
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,840
analytical methods and that really

515
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,519
screws up any analytical piece if you

516
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,158
think about an analytical peak being

517
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,679
like this beautifully shaped like peak

518
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,200
um

519
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,280
standard methods you pull out of the

520
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,600
literature will give you like a camel

521
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,599
hump

522
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,919
you can't work with this

523
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,480
and then

524
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,759
so summarizing a year of our analytical

525
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,919
work here

526
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,480
you can you can make sure that it's just

527
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,159
one peak but then that peak uh then

528
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,000
you're using so strong

529
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,640
acid conditions that actually some of

530
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,640
your psilocybin is co is already

531
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,320
dephosphorylated to silosen so you're

532
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,679
testing something else

533
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:40,079
or you're using just the right

534
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:42,000
meth liquids but then these liquids

535
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,839
break your machine

536
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,519
and you can run your machine for like a

537
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,038
day and then you have to repair it for a

538
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,359
week and then you'd run a day in the

539
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,759
repair week we have done that a few

540
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,798
iterations

541
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,679
so

542
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,918
finding the right analytical method to

543
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,240
have something robust reliable and that

544
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,038
doesn't break your machine all the time

545
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,640
is really complicated because this

546
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:08,480
molecule is so fidgety it wants to be in

547
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,200
different states and if you look at it

548
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,679
weirdly it breaks down

549
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,240
talking about the breakdown we get

550
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,759
milled mushrooms from most of the

551
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,440
suppliers

552
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,158
and what we find

553
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,960
so suppliers have used a mill that ran a

554
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,760
little hot so they actually

555
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,840
dephosphorylated

556
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,839
psilocybin to cellosa

557
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,839
already

558
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:36,639
and obviously that's maybe not what they

559
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,279
want to do so there is the the analytics

560
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,120
which are complicated already show you

561
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,200
the way towards

562
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,558
problems in production or issues in

563
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,640
production you have to think about

564
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,798
why do i even go about psilocybin and

565
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,759
solos and which one do we want do we

566
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:53,759
want one or the other

567
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,079
for everyone who is used to the cannabis

568
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,080
world you know about thc acid being

569
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,759
produced by the plant and thc is what

570
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,000
actually gets you high so you have to

571
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,480
convert it and it's similar in

572
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,038
psilocybin that the mushroom produces

573
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,279
psilocybin but the dephosphorylated

574
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,440
celosin is actually the active drug so

575
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,519
psilocybin is the pro drug and the

576
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,279
conversion happens in your stomach so

577
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,038
the stomach acid is strong enough to

578
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,879
dephosphorylate

579
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,400
so you could say oh let's do it like

580
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,600
like in the cannabis industry just make

581
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,440
thc slash cilosin and just give celosium

582
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,359
to the patients it's the the product

583
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,240
they actually want and if milling

584
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:35,599
dephosphorylates already why is so bad

585
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,759
so lawson is really unstable

586
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:42,959
so it likes to oxidize it turns blue

587
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,038
it degrades it disappears so psilocybin

588
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,079
the pro drug is actually the most stable

589
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,158
one

590
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,599
and that that you can store

591
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,640
somewhat longer

592
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,038
okay

593
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,559
all right a lot to unpack there but from

594
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,558
what i understand

595
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,798
if i were a cannabis lab looking to get

596
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,480
into doing psilocybin testing it's not

597
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,359
as easy as just

598
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,240
running

599
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,759
um

600
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,359
the mushrooms through what you already

601
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,440
have there you're probably gonna have to

602
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,399
have a dedicated instrument for that no

603
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,440
um

604
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,919
the instrument itself no but uh you need

605
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,600
to change the column and with that comes

606
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,480
a different solvent system and so

607
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:21,439
flushing out so turning from the thc

608
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,200
method to your psilocybin method

609
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,600
will take you like

610
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,240
half an hour hour of flushing

611
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:31,199
just like clean the machine in between

612
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,679
so that can be an impediment to to

613
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,679
throughput

614
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,159
the although the big ticket items you

615
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,000
already have it's just the the standard

616
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,640
operating procedures the handling the

617
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,960
methods that have to be updated and it's

618
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,520
not that easy it's not changing cannabis

619
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,200
to hemp it's it's it's a different beast

620
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,599
you have to deal with

621
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,519
no one it seems like the material itself

622
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,519
is very sensitive right and i would

623
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,839
think that even preparing that sample

624
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,879
you could inadvertently be

625
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,959
converting psilocybin to salosine or or

626
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,080
changing that polarity of the molecule

627
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,919
so i imagine that has to be considered a

628
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,918
side note if you mill a mushroom in your

629
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,759
cannabis lab or your cannabis will then

630
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,759
start failing for for fungal

631
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:18,558
contamination of course

632
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:20,158
so you have to consider that aspect too

633
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,918
yeah absolutely i mean us on the

634
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,360
medicinal genomic side you know we make

635
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,400
microbial uh detection assays so

636
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,119
when we're looking at some of these

637
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,320
regulations that are coming out um we

638
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,599
kind of have to remind some of these

639
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,519
regulators that you don't want to be

640
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,319
doing total yeast and mold testing on

641
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,759
your

642
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,200
on your mushrooms

643
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,200
you're going to get a failure every time

644
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:46,719
but although we have gotten moldy my

645
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:50,240
psychedelic mushrooms sure so a mushroom

646
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,240
with a different mushroom on it

647
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,798
yeah i mean in that case then ducking

648
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,679
off psychedelics

649
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,000
in that case we got to do

650
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,080
species-specific testing right in order

651
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,599
to make sure that you know whatever mold

652
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,399
is going to be growing on that it isn't

653
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,158
pathogenic or isn't you know detrimental

654
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,240
in some way right and with that in mind

655
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,080
and maybe that's a good segue here that

656
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,319
you know in addition to actually testing

657
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,240
for the active compound the psilocybin

658
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,158
um are there other potential

659
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,558
contaminants or

660
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,240
um potentially dangerous compounds that

661
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,079
could be coming along for the ride

662
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,120
because i know that there's a lot of

663
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,399
different

664
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,319
strains of mushrooms and they produce a

665
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,240
lot of different compounds and if you're

666
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,399
not careful they they could be harmful

667
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,480
so um have you had any experience

668
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,600
testing for anything like that

669
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,038
right so uh twofold if you do some let's

670
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,158
do synthetic compounds first so

671
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,960
synthetic compounds might have unwanted

672
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:49,200
impurities in them solvents heavy metals

673
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,200
from a previous catalytic step

674
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,839
those are often of issue but generally

675
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,558
single compound

676
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,519
materials are easy to purify and isolate

677
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,399
so

678
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,400
less of a concern

679
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,840
mushrooms

680
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,558
so while canada has a legal framework to

681
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,558
produce and

682
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,879
give them to patients

683
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,839
they haven't yet really built the whole

684
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,320
production framework legal set up of how

685
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,439
to how to do this at scale it's more

686
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:23,278
like small scale patient focused

687
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,200
not yet anywhere close to what we're

688
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,480
used to from the cannabis world with

689
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,240
regulations

690
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
so producers come to us and it's like

691
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,120
okay we want this this this and this and

692
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,400
this and i was like where did you get

693
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,479
the idea from it's like yeah we just

694
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
looked at cannabis regulations and so

695
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,319
okay so

696
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:41,439
the ece mold is really hard and please

697
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:43,278
don't let us plate this

698
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,120
and then there are like pesticides and

699
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,038
the guidelines are for

700
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,439
for green leaf

701
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,919
weed and not for mushrooms so i'm not

702
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,640
sure how applicable the the pesticide

703
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,159
guidelines are in any way

704
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,799
um

705
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,120
but that said we are already used to

706
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,359
that uh cannabis and hemp is a

707
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,519
bioaccumulator of heavy metals the same

708
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,359
goes for mushrooms

709
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:11,519
so i'm from europe

710
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:13,678
i was born shortly after chernobyl

711
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,480
uh

712
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,000
we wouldn't eat we're like in in central

713
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,640
to eastern europe you wouldn't eat

714
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,960
mushrooms from the forest for decades

715
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,240
because they were they came with flavor

716
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,360
and glow

717
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,519
so uh so you don't want that

718
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,759
so so bioaccumulation of heavy metals

719
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,839
might be an issue

720
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,759
pesticides we don't really know

721
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,678
most of them are all of them are grown

722
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,679
indoors under control conditions anyway

723
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,640
then

724
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:48,398
what about wild growing mushrooms

725
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,559
they actually grow here in the bc

726
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,319
forests like we can pick psychedelic

727
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:56,639
mushrooms in the forest

728
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,639
near the library at the university maybe

729
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,918
but

730
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,558
the problem there is

731
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,480
wild grown mushrooms or mushrooms that

732
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,759
were not grown under health canada

733
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,558
license

734
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,558
cannot be used in my laboratory because

735
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:11,839
my license doesn't allow that i can only

736
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,119
work with material that came from

737
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:17,119
licensed lab producers so we are

738
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,519
currently waiting for our dealer's

739
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,079
license not to produce anything but to

740
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,240
be able to go field testing with that

741
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,720
license i can accept material from

742
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,440
non-licensed sources like

743
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,440
patients that want their mushroom tested

744
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,240
like a secondary test

745
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,360
or i can go into the forest

746
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,960
and start looking at mushrooms

747
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,639
find the psychedelics and then find the

748
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,200
ones that look like psychedelics might

749
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,720
have toxins on it right

750
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,120
i talked about

751
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,558
our methods of how to quantify

752
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:52,319
psilocybin but that's only the start

753
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,119
um we also want to know what else is in

754
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,079
there

755
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,839
and normal analytics work by you know

756
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,720
what you're looking for you build your

757
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,720
method you look for it you say yes or no

758
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,558
and then how much

759
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,759
but it gets more interesting when you

760
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:10,720
start looking for

761
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,720
compounds that you didn't expect

762
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,480
so um

763
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,640
the first version is called targeted

764
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,200
analysis and we are actually more

765
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,159
interested in untargeted analysis

766
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,759
so um we have a

767
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,440
a beefed up

768
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,679
hplc

769
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,240
that's a little bit too expensive for my

770
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,399
own liking and and for any normal

771
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,278
testing laboratory anyway

772
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,759
uh it's an lc qtof

773
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,960
so i can run samples through it

774
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:43,038
uh see everything that's in there

775
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,200
so we run math rooms through it and we

776
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:46,158
see thousands of compounds thousands of

777
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,558
compounds

778
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,080
and you can't go by hand and say like i

779
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,918
take this one and this one and i know

780
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,558
what that one is that just doesn't work

781
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,320
with the number of compounds you get so

782
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,359
there are libraries but then we're

783
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,200
looking at

784
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,798
psychedelic mushrooms that haven't

785
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,038
really been studied so you don't have

786
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,440
library hits for it

787
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:08,000
so we actually developed

788
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,080
an artificial intelligence that uses

789
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,200
like it's actually based on language

790
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,678
languaging processing

791
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,278
to identify

792
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,200
similar compounds and like family trees

793
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,839
so we can now follow

794
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,159
psych tryptamine so psilocybin is a

795
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,398
tryptamine can follow them along and

796
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,399
find new tryptamines find related

797
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:33,119
compounds we might get a hit of

798
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,038
something that's related to a toxin in a

799
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,959
different mushroom so we can now

800
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,720
identify those

801
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,798
and that is a really interesting field

802
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,120
of study but it's it's complicated if

803
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,359
you thought getting a good peak of

804
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,199
psilocybin through a column is hard

805
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,079
doing that for thousands of compounds

806
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,038
gets a bit more complicated and we're in

807
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,278
the early phases of going through it but

808
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,679
our first look on a mushroom

809
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,599
um when you look at the table there are

810
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,600
seven tryptamines known and you're an

811
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,398
eighth you can assume exists just

812
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,959
because of structure we found 14. like

813
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,518
we found 14 things that look like

814
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,679
tryptamines in a psychedelic mushroom so

815
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,640
now we're like okay what is going on

816
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,960
there

817
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,399
right and and that becomes interesting

818
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,880
and will grow with with size of of on

819
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,558
volume of mushrooms we get in different

820
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,000
different cultivars different strains

821
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:24,798
will help us

822
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,038
so

823
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,879
um i will have a lot of fun in that

824
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:32,000
regard

825
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,399
so does health canada sort of limit the

826
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,720
types of strains that licensed growers

827
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:39,278
can work with because i know that for

828
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,720
example here in the states in oregon uh

829
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:44,000
they're specifically limiting the

830
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,360
program to um silos of cubensis

831
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,720
um

832
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,519
so is there a similar thing going on in

833
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,399
canada i heard of that in oregon that's

834
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,038
when you have uh regulators writing

835
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,158
rules without fully understanding what

836
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,720
they're working with that never happens

837
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,519
obviously they are always perfectly

838
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,679
informed and know every detail

839
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,159
of it and can't foresee every every

840
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,320
future permutation of what the rule will

841
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,200
lead to um

842
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:16,240
delta eight um

843
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,960
so uh in canada

844
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,278
that is not the case to my understanding

845
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,798
so i've talked to to growers and they

846
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,319
have gone through

847
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,158
60 100 different strains of mushrooms

848
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,158
and like trying to find the right ones

849
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,559
they want to grow

850
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,960
so i i don't see that as an issue here

851
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,000
in canada so here we can still

852
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,360
um

853
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,159
grow a lot

854
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,278
but

855
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,519
what the

856
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,319
what the canadian authorities are very

857
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,240
interested in is the concentration of

858
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,720
psilocybin and solution and other

859
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,200
psychedelic compounds in those mushrooms

860
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,558
so they need to be given

861
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,640
to to a quite exact number

862
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,678
uh because

863
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,679
they don't they don't

864
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,839
they don't judge you by how many

865
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,319
mushrooms you have they judge you by the

866
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:08,000
weight of psilocybin you have oh and

867
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,158
your licensing

868
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,679
um is like based on the value of

869
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,399
material you can have on site

870
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,440
so when your mushroom is too potent you

871
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:22,558
might bust your your allowance in that

872
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:27,120
particular safe so there there are

873
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:29,200
interesting um rules one has to stick to

874
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,959
great yeah and so and that's interesting

875
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,880
that you're starting to analyze what

876
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,319
additional compounds are in these

877
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,240
mushrooms because we have to imagine

878
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,558
that there's going to be other compounds

879
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,159
of interest right um

880
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,480
i mean i was talking with with david

881
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,159
mary out at canmed and he was you know

882
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,079
kind of saying that psilocybin is to

883
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,159
mushrooms pretty much what thc is to

884
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,158
cannabis um that it's really just the

885
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,840
starting point and there could be any

886
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,440
number of additional compounds that

887
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,599
might have benefits

888
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,120
yeah i'm a big fan of david mary's work

889
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,038
and he comes more from the biological

890
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:02,239
side and i come more from the chemistry

891
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:05,440
side and we we meet in the middle

892
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,759
and he has all the glowing uh an amazing

893
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,838
work published where i'm just aspiring

894
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,599
to

895
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,000
so

896
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,838
for me yes psilocybin is the thc of

897
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,239
mushrooms right it's the starting point

898
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,398
it's the it's the banner molecule and

899
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,078
then there's so much more to find and so

900
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,239
for me compounds of interest if it's a

901
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,320
compound i'm interested in it so

902
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,039
everything is compound of interest to me

903
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,200
but i'm a chemist

904
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,279
you probably define compound of interest

905
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,398
as a medically

906
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,599
effective or some medical response some

907
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:39,598
medical value to it

908
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,878
to be fair we are still not there on the

909
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,799
cannabis side even like

910
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,878
there are over 100 cannabinoids but you

911
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,280
can't tell me all the medical aspects

912
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,000
that each minor cannabinoid does

913
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,720
so

914
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,719
yeah psilocybin mushrooms produce more

915
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,838
than psilocybin there are other

916
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,559
tryptamines there are other

917
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,119
architectures of interest there even

918
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,920
there even some sugars that that are

919
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,079
known

920
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,400
specifically to mushrooms and not any

921
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,839
seen anywhere else and

922
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,960
carbohydrates

923
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:15,679
sugars can have

924
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,800
biological properties so

925
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,480
sure

926
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,440
there's there's a lot to unpack

927
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,119
but my job is to just make sure that i

928
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,599
draw the right molecule and give you the

929
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,440
right concentration what you do with it

930
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:33,838
that's where the

931
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,838
biologists and medics come in

932
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,960
great all right so

933
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,519
winding down here because i do want to

934
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,039
be mindful of your time i'm curious what

935
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,159
has been the most surprising thing

936
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,320
you've learned while working with

937
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,159
psilocybin and these psychoactive

938
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,000
mushrooms

939
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,000
how complicated the regulations are

940
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,239
look we we have a laboratory that is

941
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,839
licensed by health canada we are

942
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,959
we are above board we do everything

943
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,639
right we don't do fast like i can i can

944
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,960
walk around the corner in downtown

945
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,480
vancouver and buy a mushroom

946
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,000
or i pick one

947
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,960
in the wild

948
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,960
near the library of the university

949
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,639
that's not within the licensing system

950
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,280
so

951
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:22,078
just to give you an idea we started this

952
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,480
whole thing of psychedelics

953
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,480
summer 2020

954
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:32,400
getting the first like real actual real

955
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,199
mushroom samples

956
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,119
into the lab

957
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,399
is an 8 to 12-month process

958
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,559
i have to get the i have to get the

959
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,920
license i have so i have to find someone

960
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,440
who wants to work with me i have to get

961
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,960
the license then they have to get the

962
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,119
license then there might be some import

963
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,920
stuff because we got some material from

964
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,400
jamaica um then that needs to go through

965
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,159
health canada and it's just and then

966
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,680
they have questions and then it's not

967
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,719
the right strain or the concentration

968
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:03,679
slide it's like it's it's frustratingly

969
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,919
hard to do work with mushrooms

970
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:09,358
at the current regulated regulatory

971
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,720
settings in cannabis i go to a website i

972
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,000
order stuff

973
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,319
i i

974
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,960
my license encompass all that analytical

975
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,440
work i buy a joint i put it on my smoke

976
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,240
machine we do analysis of how much thc

977
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,559
you inhale based on the humidity profile

978
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,199
of the joint and i get the answers like

979
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,358
two days later

980
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,439
and in a mushroom getting that answer

981
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:35,119
takes me eight months

982
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,800
wow that's frustrating

983
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,960
so that's the

984
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,119
most annoying and surprising thing i did

985
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,679
not expect that it's so much harder than

986
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,680
cannabis

987
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,599
um

988
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,480
and the other surprising part is how

989
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,960
difficult uh mushroom analytics is like

990
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,199
hplc methods for mushrooms are so much

991
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,440
harder than cannabis

992
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,598
it's not even the same magnitude or

993
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,720
universe they are so much harder to

994
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,280
analyze

995
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,279
from from the method

996
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,200
and now for the again the i guess the

997
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,079
cannabis labs who are are

998
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,319
considering getting into uh psilocybin

999
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,039
in mushroom testing are there sort of

1000
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,480
established methods out there now that

1001
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,719
they can sort of use or they're gonna

1002
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,679
have to figure it out on their own no

1003
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,279
so

1004
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,358
when we started the project we obviously

1005
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,079
did a comprehensive literature review

1006
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,519
what's out there so the un has a method

1007
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,960
it's

1008
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,000
it's nice

1009
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,199
it's not good um there are literature

1010
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,480
methods we recreated them we use them on

1011
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,480
pure psilocybin so we're ju no matrix

1012
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,639
effects that could be an issue we just

1013
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,119
run the method as in the literature on

1014
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:47,920
pure psilocybin or even on reference

1015
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,400
standards and it doesn't work

1016
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,720
right we we went through dozens of

1017
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,000
methods and they all don't work or

1018
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,480
they're just like

1019
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,039
okayish or give you camel

1020
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,039
uh bumps like uh

1021
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,358
it was frustrating how bad the

1022
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,838
literature was on this

1023
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:10,078
um so we published a method one method

1024
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:12,480
already we put this on chem archive

1025
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,200
uh it's a good robust method we actually

1026
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,599
made it work for c18

1027
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,799
because it's like the easiest adaptable

1028
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,039
method

1029
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,960
but we already like we're past this

1030
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,279
we're a few generations later and we're

1031
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,679
still working so if you're a cannabis

1032
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,800
laboratory that wants to add psilocybin

1033
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,639
testing

1034
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,039
um

1035
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,879
either you're willing to throw a year of

1036
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,838
development work at it

1037
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,559
um

1038
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:38,880
or

1039
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,039
um we are happy to share

1040
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,599
like reach out ask us

1041
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,519
we might have be able to share

1042
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,599
well that's excellent that's um

1043
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,440
that's a great service um so hopefully

1044
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,200
some people can stand on your shoulders

1045
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,200
and uh they don't have to reinvent the

1046
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,118
wheel yeah because because we don't do

1047
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,279
testing like

1048
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,838
we don't do compliant testing i don't do

1049
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,599
high throughput testing

1050
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:05,920
we only focus on like method development

1051
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,200
or weird analytics like we have a smoke

1052
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,720
machine a robot that smokes joints

1053
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:14,719
we have particle sizes uh a cutoff like

1054
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,239
we have all the toys for the weird and

1055
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,679
wonderful stuff

1056
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,879
uh but i don't have the capacity or um

1057
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,679
the skill

1058
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,960
uh to be given a hundred samples and

1059
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:26,960
return them within the week

1060
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,960
yeah makes sense and they have

1061
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,880
very good testing laboratories that do

1062
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,639
that very very well

1063
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,880
so leave it to them

1064
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:40,239
okay and i know i said two questions ago

1065
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,358
it was my last question but one more um

1066
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:43,199
so given that you're not doing

1067
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,519
compliance testing and you're doing some

1068
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,960
more more research based what is the

1069
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,400
next um sort of project or kind of thing

1070
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,920
that you're working on now is it

1071
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,280
refining those methods or is there

1072
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,838
something specific that you're looking

1073
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,480
at so we we obviously always refine

1074
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,400
methods um then obviously uh refining

1075
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,000
the method of untargeted analysis and

1076
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,599
like language ai

1077
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,480
to figure out what compounds are in

1078
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,400
there

1079
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,240
but the next two big focuses and

1080
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,280
we are waiting for the right licensing

1081
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:15,199
on this

1082
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,200
um is extraction research

1083
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,679
because extracting a mushroom is

1084
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,680
considered production even if i'm

1085
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,519
extracting half a gram of mushroom for

1086
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,759
analytical purposes

1087
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,358
if it's not just analytics but i'm

1088
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,280
actually interested in the extraction

1089
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,480
part then it's production and

1090
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,280
otherwise

1091
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,199
hence earlier what i'm frustrated about

1092
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,040
so uh

1093
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,639
extraction of mushrooms for an

1094
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,559
industrial scale is an interesting

1095
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,799
question that i'm that i'm

1096
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,358
like to work with and and help the

1097
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,359
industry

1098
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,039
and no you can't just use your

1099
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,879
extraction method from cannabis you have

1100
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,960
to do it again new

1101
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,119
similar to the analytical methods

1102
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,800
and the other aspect is product

1103
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,680
stability like in what form do we have

1104
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,599
to store psychedelic compounds

1105
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,440
in matrix

1106
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,599
in pure form

1107
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,559
in formulations for patients

1108
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,039
that we ensure we are actually giving

1109
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,440
that material to the patient even if

1110
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:15,440
that is

1111
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,040
six months removed from testing

1112
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,118
well i don't those are two

1113
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,279
two great focus areas and two

1114
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,400
potentially great canbed talks so uh

1115
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,280
we'll um

1116
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,880
we'll look forward to that

1117
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,960
all right marcus well thanks again and

1118
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,640
thanks for staying a little over too to

1119
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,960
answer my questions about psilocybin

1120
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,039
testing um but again one more time

1121
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,599
before i let you go please do share um
