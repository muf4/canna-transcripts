1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,679
good morning

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,839
so my name is justin bueno i'm the

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,400
scientific director of goodness growth

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,320
holdings formerly virio health

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,440
we are a multi-state medical cannabis

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,359
company

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,039
and i'm excited to present some of our

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,840
research on

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,160
a novel approach for preserving

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:28,079
terpene content of packaged cannabis

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,079
inflorescence or cannabis flower

12
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,000
so let's talk about flour for medical

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
purposes in our four markets it is the

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,359
most popular dosage form

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
this may be due to some legacy reasons

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,759
patients have experienced use with flour

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,039
in the past

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,238
it may be a little bit cheaper than

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,960
other

20
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,038
extract products but of course there are

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
some advantages or potential advantages

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
to using

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,039
a whole plant product or the botanical

24
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,679
dosage form

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,920
compared to other formulated extracts

26
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,840
and of course isolates flowers should

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,198
have a more comprehensive phytochemical

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
composition

29
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,239
and of course these include entourage

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,280
compounds that may synergistically

31
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,280
enhance the efficacy of the dosage form

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,320
and especially compared to oral dosage

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
forms

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,679
patients should see an improved

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,200
bioavailability and reduce onset

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,320
there are a couple of exceptions to this

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,640
but in general this may be the case

38
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,039
however there are also

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560
reasons for concern

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,720
when we talk about patients using this

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,478
popular dosage form and many of these

42
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,000
concerns are around the lack of

43
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,159
standardization

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,399
so what terpenes are on the label or

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,240
even tested for will vary from market to

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,118
market

47
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,399
and from manufacturer to manufacturer

48
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,640
different manufacturers are using

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,799
different packaging systems and the

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,560
implication on the phytochemical

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,399
stability of these packaging systems is

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,280
not fully understood

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,519
and there's little to no regulation on

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,159
cultivar or strain labeling and how that

55
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,000
links to the phytochemical composition

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,280
of the

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,239
dosage form so all this leads to lot to

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,159
lot variability which may impact the

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,920
efficacy and experience a patient gets

60
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,560
when they consume

61
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,958
the botanical dosage form

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,520
and this is not only from different

63
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,439
manufacturer to manufacturer it may be

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,159
even subsequent lots within the same

65
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,159
manufacturer

66
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,199
and one class of phytochemicals that is

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,480
especially susceptible to this

68
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,159
variability

69
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,399
would be terpenes and terpenoids

70
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,239
dr spellman had a great talk yesterday

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
introducing some of the potential

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,239
pharmacological activity

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
of terpenes and there's a bunch of

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,519
available research on that and

75
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
continuing

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
the field is continuing to research the

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,280
potential pharmacological activity of

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,239
terpenes but also they impart their

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,360
unique

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,400
flavor and aroma on cannabis and

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,239
many

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,439
patients directly associate this flavor

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,280
and aroma with product quality

84
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,719
so although terpenes are a critical

85
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,158
phytochemical component of a cannabis

86
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,158
flower

87
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,919
their inherent volatility makes them

88
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:19,639
more susceptible to degradation as

89
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,639
compared to the other

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
phytochemicals within cannabis

91
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,519
and this is relatively well established

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,598
in the industry but dr l sholey was even

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,759
studying this back in the 90s a paper

94
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,798
from 1995

95
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,959
he reported a 55 loss in terpene content

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,239
of packaged whole flower after three

97
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,519
months of storage now there are numerous

98
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,599
parameters that are going to affect this

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,920
rate of degradation and you can do your

100
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,839
own internal study to kind of assess

101
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,919
your

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,158
stability of terpenes and your either

103
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,039
bulk storage or primary packaging

104
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,359
systems our in-house studies showed a 38

105
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,120
loss in terpene content over a four week

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,080
duration

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,640
so not only are the parameters that you

108
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,040
use in cultivation and then processing

109
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,958
of flour going to affect

110
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,039
the concentration of terpenes and flour

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,039
and the profile

112
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,039
once they are packaged in their primary

113
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,039
packaging system ready to be dispensed

114
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,639
to patients they are not

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,250
completely immune to this variability

116
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
and that's because

117
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,000
[Music]

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,759
terpenes

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,918
are inherently volatile and

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,439
even when they're packaged

121
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,198
if you wouldn't mind clicking on the

122
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,120
powerpoint slide

123
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,120
to try to get my video to play thank you

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,160
even when they're packaged they're going

125
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,000
to evaporate from a flower and fill the

126
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
head space the container and when a

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,199
patient goes to

128
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,959
open the container

129
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,199
to

130
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,560
collect the dose for use those terpenes

131
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,280
that have evaporated will be lost in the

132
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,639
environment now this is especially

133
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,399
important in a

134
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,560
medical market where you don't expect a

135
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:06,719
patient to consume 3.5 or 7 grams of

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,560
flour in one dose

137
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,039
that may occur i guess in it more in an

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,639
adult use market if they're so inclined

139
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,879
but

140
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,360
this means that subsequent doses of

141
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,038
cannabis flower even from the same jar

142
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
are going to be at a reduced terpene

143
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,159
concentration as compared to the initial

144
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,478
dose

145
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,240
and the terpene profile may change

146
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,199
as you would expect the more volatile

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,199
monoterpenes to be lost first

148
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,160
so the changes in

149
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,759
profile and concentration have unknown

150
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,439
implications on the efficacy and

151
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,720
experience a patient may have when

152
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,519
consuming

153
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
cannabis flower

154
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,120
so

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
we saw this as an unmet need in the

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,918
industry and we wanted to determine if

157
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,519
we could come up with a solution

158
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,120
so here we have

159
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,680
sorry

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,038
here we have a schematic from our patent

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,918
application

162
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,360
where

163
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,038
we wanted to investigate the use of a

164
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,000
two-chamber system

165
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,240
one chamber housing a cannabis flower

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,199
and then the second chamber houses an

167
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,400
exogenous terpene source

168
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,840
and the thought behind this was the

169
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,918
exogenous terpenes would fill the

170
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,318
headspace of the primary

171
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,159
container containing the cannabis and

172
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,280
act as a replenishment source for any

173
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,919
terpenes that had evaporated

174
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,559
and in fact

175
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,240
we wanted to investigate this

176
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,639
as a

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,960
replenishment source for terpenes that

178
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,960
may have evaporated

179
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,439
let's see we have another cartoon in

180
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,879
this case the

181
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,879
um

182
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,719
green circles would be the endogenous

183
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,399
terpenes evaporating from flower and the

184
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
darker blue

185
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,478
circles will be the terpenes from the

186
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,478
exogenous source

187
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,160
so excited to present some of our

188
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,319
prototype proof of concept and

189
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,560
validation experiments here i have a

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,439
photo of our prototype the primary

191
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,639
packaging was just an amber glass jar

192
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:07,038
the inner matrix houses the

193
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,360
exogenous terpene source that the

194
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,800
terpenes are impregnated into

195
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
and we wanted to investigate if they

196
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,199
rapidly evaporated and filled the

197
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,639
headspace the container of the system

198
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,879
our secondary chamber in this case was

199
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,879
3d printed and

200
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,639
you can see it's slotted to allows for

201
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,159
communication with the primary chamber

202
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,280
and it was actually integrated directly

203
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,919
into the cap

204
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,239
of the packaging system

205
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,120
so some assembly the system the matrix

206
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,560
is placed into the secondary chamber

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,038
in the experiments i'm going to report

208
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,800
here they're all performed in triplicate

209
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,120
of course our control samples did not

210
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,199
contain any exogenous terpenes

211
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,038
and we looked at

212
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,520
varying the amount of exogenous terpenes

213
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,120
utilized in the study using the novel

214
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,198
system and these terpenes were added by

215
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,439
hand pipet you can see the pipette tip

216
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,439
there

217
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,959
continuing with the assembly of the

218
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,279
system the secondary chamber is

219
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,478
integrated directly into the cap

220
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,159
and in the experiments i'm going to

221
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,000
report on today we looked at three

222
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,680
different delta nine thc dominant

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
chemotypes

224
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,360
and this material was stored for up to

225
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,400
five months

226
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,520
and to mimic patient use the jars were

227
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,598
open periodically and samples were taken

228
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,639
and quantitatively assessed for terpene

229
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,478
content by headspace gas chromatography

230
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,519
mass spectrometry

231
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,680
and the results from samples stored with

232
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,159
and without the novel system were

233
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,160
compared

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,599
so the first set of data i'd like to

235
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,079
show you was from

236
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,800
a sample of killer kush which is a delta

237
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,479
9 thc dominant material

238
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,879
and you can see the initial total

239
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,519
terpene content which is the orange bar

240
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,120
was 0.5 percent so relatively depleted

241
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,639
material a little bit lower

242
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,399
concentration than you would expect in a

243
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,879
medical market

244
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,360
nonetheless after five months of storage

245
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,439
you can see that the material

246
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
was susceptible to further loss in

247
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,519
terpene content and this loss was found

248
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,559
to be statistically significant with the

249
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,600
reported p-value here

250
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,759
however

251
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,278
using the novel packaging system in this

252
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,838
case we're looking at two different

253
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,759
terpene blends which we've named uh

254
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,839
relatively volatile and relatively

255
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,519
non-volatile i'll get into those blends

256
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,279
in a little bit

257
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,959
the

258
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,200
we were showing a proof of concept for

259
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,199
the ability of the system to maintain

260
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,360
the native terpene content of the flower

261
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,519
at the time of packaging

262
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,759
so this was um

263
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
an exciting preliminary result

264
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,958
you can see a little bit of variability

265
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,200
in

266
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,199
the terpene content of flour stored

267
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,480
using the novel system but this

268
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,160
variability was not found to be

269
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
statistically significant so here we're

270
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,159
showing a novel approach to preserve the

271
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,319
terpene content after five months of

272
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,838
storage

273
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,278
visually we can see the differences

274
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,440
between the samples stored with the

275
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,639
novel system and without

276
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
but we can also

277
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,720
look at that quantitatively using a nova

278
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
data analysis and

279
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,639
the difference was

280
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,639
statistically significant

281
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
we also found that we could augment the

282
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,959
terpene

283
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,479
content of packaged flour if we increase

284
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,000
the amount of exogenous terpenes

285
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,759
utilized

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,440
in this case we're reporting the use of

287
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,039
three percent exogenous terpenes

288
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,079
relative to the weight of the package

289
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,679
flower

290
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,359
and here we can see that we are showing

291
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,519
a proof of concept for the ability to

292
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,919
rejuvenate material that was relatively

293
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,759
depleted of terpene content

294
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,439
in this example

295
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,120
two levels that are now approaching what

296
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,399
you would expect in a medical cannabis

297
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,320
market

298
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,159
this also has some interesting

299
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,079
applications in dulce mar adult use

300
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,519
markets where patients or consumers are

301
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,519
looking for higher and higher terpene

302
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,519
concentrations

303
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,278
so we wanted to investigate the or

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,159
further investigate the relationship

305
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,240
between the amount of exogenous terpenes

306
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,559
used in the novel system and the impact

307
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,480
on the resulting

308
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,359
concentration of the packaged flour

309
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
after

310
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,959
the storage duration in this case we're

311
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,519
reporting

312
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:10,159
an experiment from another delta nine

313
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,639
thc dominant chemotype cream caramel

314
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,240
after six weeks of storage and we're we

315
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,159
have various samples that were stored

316
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
with different amounts of exogenous

317
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,639
terpenes

318
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,720
so after six weeks of storage all

319
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,360
um samples had a higher total terpene

320
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,040
content than control but we wanted to

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,519
determine the amount of exogenous

322
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,439
terpenes required to maintain that

323
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,078
native terpene content at the time of

324
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
packaging

325
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,959
and the relationship was relatively

326
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,279
linear

327
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:42,159
and using the equation of the line we

328
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,958
calculate that about 1.2 percent of

329
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,958
exogenous terpenes would be required to

330
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,559
maintain that native terpene content and

331
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,638
this equates to 40 milligrams of

332
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:55,719
exogenous terpenes per

333
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,720
for a 3.5 gram jar of flour

334
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
and then the final experiment i'd like

335
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,599
to show from this part of my

336
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,480
presentation is the impact the novel

337
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,759
system has on terpene profile

338
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,120
so here i'm showing two different

339
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,720
samples of a flower from the chemotype

340
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,799
dj's gold

341
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
these two samples were grown and

342
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,639
processed at the same site

343
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,278
and they

344
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,360
differed in age by one year

345
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,519
so the sample labeled

346
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,440
one year post harvest was aged one year

347
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,480
prior to this experiment

348
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,430
and you can see that there are

349
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,278
differences in the terpene profiles

350
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:33,199
[Music]

351
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,600
some of it being due to the differences

352
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,000
in age of the material but also others

353
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,560
may be due to changes in environmental

354
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,120
factors that are just kind of

355
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,719
inherent to growing cannabis

356
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,600
one change related to uh to age you can

357
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,360
see is the reduction of the beta mercene

358
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,560
percentage of the terpene profile on the

359
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,839
older material that's the light blue pie

360
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,518
slice

361
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,160
and the more fresh material was 36

362
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,480
percent and the older material was 13.8

363
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,958
percent and this kind of makes sense as

364
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,120
uh mercene is a relatively volatile

365
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,638
monoterpene

366
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
so to quantitatively assess the

367
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,680
differences in terpene profiles we

368
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,440
looked at their

369
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,000
percent differences and this would be a

370
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,000
zero to two hundred percent scale

371
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,679
where a result of two hundred percent is

372
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,159
uh the worst case scenario the two

373
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,638
profiles don't share a single terpene

374
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,679
and the result um the initial result was

375
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
55

376
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,259
so keep that number in mind

377
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
we then stored both samples

378
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:32,958
[Music]

379
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,560
in the presence of this eight part

380
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,559
terpene blend shown here

381
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,078
and after four weeks of storage we can

382
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,078
see that the

383
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,799
packaged material takes on aspects of

384
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,799
the exogenous terpene blend and the

385
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,399
differences in the terpene profiles from

386
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,120
the two different samples

387
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,919
was drastically reduced we went from a

388
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,600
value of 55 to a percent difference of

389
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,879
16

390
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
so this has some interesting

391
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,240
applications

392
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,680
um for medical purposes one being

393
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,680
it may be an ability to more reliably

394
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,838
and reproducibly offer cannabis with a

395
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,239
consistent terpene profile

396
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,240
which may be

397
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,519
propagated to patients providing them

398
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,320
more reliable efficacy in their dose

399
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,879
it also may be a way to more closely

400
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,120
mimic the terpene profile of the live

401
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:29,039
plant we know that as soon as we harvest

402
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,399
the plant we're losing terpenes and yes

403
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,480
there are some

404
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,919
ways you can mitigate that loss

405
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,320
but maybe using this approach would be a

406
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,399
way to more closely mimic the profile of

407
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,639
the live plant

408
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,759
and i you could see future applications

409
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,159
where

410
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,838
you could reliably achieve a terpene

411
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,399
profile that had been

412
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,839
used in a successful clinical trial

413
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,600
where

414
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,519
the trial determined that these specific

415
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,959
terpenes were

416
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,240
critical to the efficacy of the

417
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,239
botanical dosage form

418
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:07,119
now we found that the exogenous terpenes

419
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,359
had different infusion rates and

420
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,679
however they were grouped by terpene

421
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,278
classification so monoterpenes at the

422
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,838
highest infusion rate followed by

423
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,759
monoterpenoids and then sesquiterpenes

424
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,680
so again for future applications of this

425
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,278
technology if you wanted to establish a

426
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,120
specific

427
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,240
terpene profile you would just have to

428
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,600
adjust

429
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,039
the um

430
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,040
concentration of the terpenes in the

431
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:32,480
exogenous blend to account for this

432
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,480
differences in infusion rate

433
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,319
so summary the first part of my

434
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:37,758
presentation

435
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,759
we achieved a proof of concept for the

436
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,320
ability to maintain the native terpene

437
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,919
content at the time of packaging

438
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,240
in a statistically significant fashion

439
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,599
as compared to control

440
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,919
we reported proof of concept for the

441
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,079
ability to adjust a terpene profile of

442
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:55,039
packaged cannabis flower and rejuvenate

443
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,399
terpenes from depleted material

444
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,639
the system was found to be effective

445
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,278
independent on several factors

446
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,360
i didn't mention previously but we use

447
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,360
cannabis derived terpene extracts

448
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,440
botanically derived terpene extract and

449
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,959
synthetic terpenes

450
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,320
and the system was effective in all

451
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,439
cases

452
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,920
of course

453
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,839
from a medicinal standpoint probably the

454
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,319
best application would be to use a

455
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,000
strain specific terpene extract

456
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,639
to

457
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,759
[Music]

458
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,440
maintain as close as possible the the

459
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,639
terpene profile

460
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,639
to the strain of interest

461
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,278
so although terpenes are of course a

462
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:38,399
critical phytochemical component in the

463
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:41,198
botanical dosage form the most important

464
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,198
component are cannabinoids

465
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,278
and if we think about cannabinoids in

466
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,359
flour and their stability and especially

467
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,159
comparing them to

468
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,680
you know traditional pharmaceuticals or

469
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,120
even other products in the medical

470
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,319
markets where cannabinoids are

471
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,320
impregnated into various matrices

472
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,079
cannabinoids in flower are more

473
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,079
susceptible to degradation as compared

474
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,919
to these other products

475
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,959
i'm showing one degradation pathway here

476
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,318
commonly uh

477
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,519
known of one

478
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,438
where a thca can degrade to cbn through

479
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,199
oxidation light heat

480
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,439
force degradation

481
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,318
but it's not just cvn there are other

482
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,240
oxidative degradings with unknown

483
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,240
pharmacological activity and toxicology

484
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,200
and the national research council of

485
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,319
canada is kind of acutely aware of the

486
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,640
potential for degradation of

487
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,000
cannabinoids in biomass

488
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,480
and they developed this cannabinoid

489
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
stability calculator which estimates the

490
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,919
rate of degradation of cannabinoids in

491
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,000
flower

492
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,440
and we performed similar experiments

493
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,440
in-house here we used hplc to

494
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,679
quantitatively determine

495
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,120
the total thc content

496
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,960
so that would be

497
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:58,879
the concentration of thca times 0.877

498
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,240
plus the concentration of thc in flower

499
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,240
after about a four month storage

500
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,720
duration

501
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,120
again we opened the jars throughout the

502
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,038
study to mimic patient use which allowed

503
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:12,319
for the incursion of oxygen into the

504
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,599
package and resulted in loss of thc

505
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,678
content

506
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,798
so our initial thc concentration was

507
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,120
about 19 and at the end it was about 16

508
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,079
percent so we reported an absolute loss

509
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,479
of about 2.9

510
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,759
this equates to a relative loss in a thc

511
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,558
concentration of 15 percent which is

512
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:36,319
significant on its own but keep in mind

513
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:38,319
the usp cannabis expert panel on uh

514
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,159
recommends a label claim specification

515
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,839
of plus minus 20

516
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,840
so now we can see a scenario where a

517
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,918
patient um

518
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,480
has held a single jar of cannabis for

519
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,280
four months and the concentration of thc

520
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,798
in their flour doesn't match or

521
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,558
is approaching this label claim

522
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,119
specification where it wouldn't match

523
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,798
the concentration on the label

524
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,399
and again that has

525
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,759
implications on the efficacy and

526
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
experience the patient's going to get

527
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,919
when they

528
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,079
use

529
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,080
their material in subsequent doses

530
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,679
so we propose to use antioxidant vapor

531
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:17,119
phase terpenes to mitigate the oxidative

532
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,600
degradation of cannabinoids and

533
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,678
the antioxidant activity of terpenes is

534
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,639
well reported in the literature here

535
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,640
we're using two

536
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,038
terpene blends we've labeled

537
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,038
non-volatile and volatile and all these

538
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,879
terpenes have been identified in

539
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:36,879
cannabis and have been linked to

540
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,880
antioxidant activity in the literature

541
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,720
we also performed an accelerated

542
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,038
stability study

543
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,759
we added hydrogen peroxide to the vapor

544
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,919
phase of packaging and hydrogen peroxide

545
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,240
readily breaks down to two hydroxy

546
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,160
radicals and these hydroxy radicals

547
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,160
mimic the oxidative degradation that

548
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,880
molecular oxygen

549
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,080
causes to thc and other cannabinoids in

550
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,600
flower

551
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,439
and of course

552
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:05,879
this may lead to the formation of cbn

553
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,880
and other oxidative degradings

554
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,840
and we did find in our accelerated

555
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,240
stability study

556
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:16,798
that we increased the

557
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,798
rate of thc degradation by about 2x

558
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,798
and if we extrapolate out our

559
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,919
non-accelerated study this would equate

560
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,519
to about an 8.7 or nine-month stability

561
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,240
study that we were able to achieve in

562
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,240
about four months

563
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,719
now samples stored using

564
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,839
exogenous vapor phase antioxidant

565
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,679
terpenes

566
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,798
mitigated the oxidative degradation of

567
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,640
thc in the forced degradation study in a

568
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,480
statistically significant fashion at all

569
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,200
three time points

570
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,519
and after four months or in this case a

571
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,759
relative nine months of storage um

572
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,839
the vapor phase the sample stored in the

573
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,400
presence of vapor-phase terpenes reduced

574
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,399
the oxidative degradation of thc by 47

575
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,400
percent

576
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
in the non-accelerated study the results

577
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,000
were a little more variable so remember

578
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,120
this was a four-month study

579
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,359
and here i'm reporting the two different

580
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,359
terpene blends we investigated

581
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,359
the three time points we looked at

582
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,918
and then three concentrations of

583
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,759
exogenous terpenes for each blend

584
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,890
and only one sample

585
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,400
which was the non-volatile terpene blend

586
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,360
[Music]

587
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,280
using three percent exogenous terpenes

588
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,959
was found to

589
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,558
mitigate the oxidative degradation of

590
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,000
thc in a statistically significant

591
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,000
fashion at all three time points

592
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,720
so to investigate if there was a

593
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,880
dose-dependent relationship

594
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,558
we looked at the p-values or we

595
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,880
generated p-values from samples stored

596
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,038
using different percentages of

597
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,159
vapor-phase terpenes

598
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,640
and

599
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,480
all samples stored with three percent

600
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,159
vapor-phase terpenes outperform two or

601
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,240
one percent

602
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,159
and sample stored using two percent

603
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,240
outperform samples stored with one

604
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,520
percent at uh the final time point so

605
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,440
here we're showing a dose-dependent

606
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,639
relationship for the ability of the

607
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,400
exogenous vapor-phase terpenes to

608
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,960
mitigate the oxidative degradation of

609
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,960
thc

610
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,158
we also showed that as the duration of

611
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:25,119
the study increased and the amount of

612
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,600
exogenous terpenes used increased

613
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,519
the quote-unquote non-volatile terpene

614
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,599
plant outperformed the volatile terpene

615
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,558
blend so you can see at the final time

616
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:37,279
point 127 days all three um

617
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,279
concentrations outperformed

618
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,480
of the non-volatile blend outperform the

619
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,158
volatile blend so this kind of

620
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,000
we added this to our study to kind of

621
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,240
understand the fundamental

622
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,279
aspects of our novel system

623
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
what

624
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,240
is the impact of the physiochemical

625
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,760
properties of the terpenes towards

626
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,319
effectiveness of the novel system and

627
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,798
here we're showing that the non-volatile

628
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,639
terpenes

629
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,119
were more effective at preventing the

630
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,759
oxidative degradation of thc and this

631
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,959
may be because the volatile terpenes are

632
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,359
evaporating and being lost the

633
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,079
environment at a at a more quickly rate

634
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,000
and over time we can see that the

635
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,599
non-volatile terpenes are outperforming

636
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,679
them

637
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,439
so summary this part of my presentation

638
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,840
we showed a dose-dependent relationship

639
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,038
between the amount of exogenous terpenes

640
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,038
used and the ability to preserve

641
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,359
cannabinoid content

642
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,879
in our accelerated stability study

643
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:33,199
remember this was about an eight or nine

644
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,200
month study so this isn't necessarily

645
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,240
a real world scenario where you would

646
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:41,278
have a patient that would store

647
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,278
a package of cannabis flour and after

648
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,519
nine months expect the same efficacy and

649
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,759
experience

650
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,918
our non-accelerated study we did show

651
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,640
that one of our terpene blends didn't

652
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,919
mitigate the oxidative degradation but

653
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,960
uh

654
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,200
we probably didn't achieve a time point

655
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,200
to

656
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,360
achieve a statistically significant

657
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,918
fashion for all of the

658
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,250
terpene blends we investigated

659
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,000
so

660
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,079
[Music]

661
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,440
it's the case often that cannabis

662
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:15,678
manufacturers and cultivators can grow

663
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,519
material faster than they can process it

664
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
and when this material is sitting around

665
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,759
what is the impact on

666
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,240
the cannabinoid and terpene

667
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,359
concentrations well

668
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,359
using this technique

669
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,558
someone could preserve

670
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:36,319
about 62 grams of thc

671
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:39,119
for a two kilogram tote of biomass again

672
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:41,119
this would be a 47 percent improvement

673
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,479
uh versus control so there are some

674
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,158
interesting applications for bulk

675
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,440
storage

676
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,159
since we didn't really achieve

677
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,159
meaningful results uh or or

678
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,039
as meaningful results in the shorter

679
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,400
time frame study

680
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,240
and of course

681
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,919
this may be a way to

682
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,759
reduce the formation of oxidative

683
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,600
degrading with unknown pharmacological

684
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,400
activity and

685
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,399
toxicology

686
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,760
so i just want to thank a couple people

687
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,120

00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,839
solmazavorzi and of course

690
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,359
the goodness growth holdings cultivation

691
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,079
team who kindly provided us with these

692
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,359
samples for research and i'd like to

693
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,720
thank you for attending my talk and

694
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,119
happy to answer any questions that you

695
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,660
may have

696
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:32,000

697
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:35,069

698
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,068
[Music]

699
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:46,158
or we can just go to the next

700
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,159
presentation

701
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,240
uh what is the approximate cost of these

702
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,679
supplemented

703
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,519
terpenes for within your enclosed system

704
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,200
yeah so

705
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,519
was the question what's the cost of the

706
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,600
exogenous terpenes yeah

707
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,798
well that's going to vary um

708
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,599
it

709
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,960
if

710
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,199
you're talking about for a manufacturer

711
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,840
who has in-house terpene extraction

712
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,000
capability

713
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,839
it's it's the really labor component

714
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,240
would be the highest cost there

715
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,240
um

716
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,440
there i mean there's some legality

717
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,679
around obtaining cannabis derived

718
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,798
terpene extracts from out of state right

719
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,200
so that

720
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,558
that's a factor but um

721
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,919
as i mentioned you only need 40

722
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,519
milligrams of exogenous terpenes to

723
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,679
preserve

724
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,440
the native terpene content of 3.5 grams

725
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,559
of flour so

726
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,159
if you were interested in using

727
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,678
botanically derived terpenes that's a

728
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,520
relatively low

729
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,360
cost i mean you can buy you know one

730
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,599
liter at a time

731
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,079
and that would

732
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,558
provide many many units of uh terpenes

733
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,558
required

734
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,158
just kind of curious um

735
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,678
hey if you try to like a positive

736
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,240
control will you use something with a

737
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,400
known redox

738
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,240
activity like bht in there and kind of

739
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,880
standardize your best case scenario for

740
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,000
protection against oxidative

741
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,480
degradation

742
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,839
and kind of possibly then tune your mix

743
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,200
of terpenes towards that ideal outcome

744
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:25,359
i'm having trouble hearing you actually

745
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,360
could you speak up sorry i'll try

746
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,319
have you

747
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,960
done the control where you have

748
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:35,839
something where you know the redox

749
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,720
activity of like bht right be a standard

750
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,480
antioxidant that goes into food stuff

751
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,319
and that would give you potentially a

752
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,720
best case scenario

753
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,240
that you could tune towards as far as

754
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,640
how much protection you get from

755
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,240
oxidative degradation

756
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,080
have you looked into that

757
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,399
uh just to confirm that was the question

758
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,319
have we used uh other exogenous uh

759
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,239
antioxidants that are not terpenes to

760
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,839
come compare the effectiveness yeah just

761
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
something that you know what this is so

762
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,439
actually that's a great question and the

763
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,359
answer is yes

764
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,919
we just published this research in the

765
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:10,558
journal of cannabis and cannabinoid

766
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,278
research and we use bht

767
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,480
to

768
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,240
compare

769
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,079
like you suggest

770
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,120
and at the first time point there was no

771
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,759
difference and then terpenes

772
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,879
outperformed pht at the second and third

773
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,919
time point as far as preserving uh thc

774
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,360
content

775
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,200
and bhc is also non-volatile

776
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,798
so

777
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,640
uh it kind of makes sense that it had

778
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,639
some efficacy but then terpenes

779
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,880
outperformed it

780
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,880
thanks

781
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,000
do you have sorry do you have any

782
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:45,519
concerns about over saturation in the

783
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,599
initial stages yeah absolutely great

784
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,798
question

785
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,798
my slide still up

786
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,679
so

787
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,759
[Music]

788
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,000
one thing we looked at was kind of

789
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,480
averaging all of our data and we looked

790
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,359
at various time points as short as one

791
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,919
week

792
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,678
and we found that

793
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,600
using the correct percentage of

794
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,038
exogenous terpenes you're not really

795
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,759
augmenting the terpene profile you're

796
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,950
just maintaining it even at the early

797
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,079
stages of storage

798
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,600
[Music]

799
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,798
yeah because

800
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,240
high terpenes may be a caustic or

801
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,319
you know at high concentrations maybe

802
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,519
unpleasant so i definitely agree with

803
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,000
the

804
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,720
the concern at looking too high of

805
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,720
concentration

806
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:37,038
oh well it's all the way at the end but

807
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,038
i think we have a 20 seconds

808
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,159
and just what i wanted to show is that

809
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,320
when we look at all the data from our

810
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,600
various experiments averaged um

811
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,398
you can see that there's uh

812
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,879
no

813
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,000
uh change if you look at the p-value on

814
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,320
the top it's not statistically

815
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,519
significant so there's not an increase

816
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,158
in

817
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,918
terpene concentration so this looks at

818
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,960
all time points we investigated which

819
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,640
include

820
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,798
one in two weeks all the way up to five

821
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,600
months and we're not showing

822
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,278
an augmentation of the the terpene

823
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,139
content

824
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,950
and i think that's my time so

825
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,069
[Music]

826
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,068
[Applause]
