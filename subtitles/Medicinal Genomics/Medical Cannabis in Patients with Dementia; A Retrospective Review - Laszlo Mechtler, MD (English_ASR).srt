1
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,080
thank you very much um thank you for

2
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:12,879
inviting me

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:17,640
back and um I'd like to thank the

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,118
coordinators um of this actually a very

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,800
informative uh discussion now there's

6
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:25,439
been talk about Al dementias before so

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,399
what I like to do is maybe go through a

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,719
little bit more in dementia and what's

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,719
about and what's new and then bringing

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,600
on some of our studies that we do at the

11
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:37,359
Den

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,120
Institute so um disclosures the only

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,640
thing that's interesting is that I have

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,359
done uh research with Charlotte's Web

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,198
looking at Pharma kinetics uh but this

16
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:50,000
discussion is not about that uh rest of

17
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:52,358
is is work I do at the Den Institute

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,039
I've have about 100 ongoing studies

19
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,800
right now in in the field of Neurology

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,399
and pain and this is our Institute in

21
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:02,399
Buffalo New York it's uh we proud of it

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,239
it's a private Institute hence we could

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,719
do a lot of things at at a private

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,400
Institute that academic institutes are a

25
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,000
little bit nervous about doing it's the

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,280
largest in the country we see about

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,319
320,000 patients per year which is about

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,759
1,400 patients every day in the field of

29
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,519
Neurology and um this is the cancer

30
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,680
hospital I'm the chief of neurooncology

31
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,039
for the last 25 years this is an

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,520
Institute that I developed about six

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,560
seven years ago in Europe specifically

34
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,359
budapes Hungary with the idea that I'm

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,840
going to do cannabis research in Hungary

36
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,560
we can't do in America so let's go to

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,118
Europe um of Hungarian descent but

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,399
unfortunately it didn't work out because

39
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,359
the government is rather restrictive and

40
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,960
Europe has been a disappointment in

41
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,319
general when it comes to cannabis

42
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:49,399
research uh working out a countries like

43
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,239
Switzerland and uh Portugal thinking

44
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,519
that we could do research but it hasn't

45
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,679
panned out as much as I would like to

46
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,798
have we do research and other things

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,439
there so at the Institute I work at the

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,759
Deb this is our number the number

49
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:05,639
actually is 13,500 patients who run a

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,959
medical cannabis program in New York

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,080
state as I mentioned we're in Buffalo

52
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,159
and New York state has rather

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,920
rigid uh precautions on how to use

54
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:18,519
cannabis so this data that we have on

55
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,318
about 13,500 as you can see most

56
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,360
patients have cancer chronic pain then

57
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:26,238
cancer and neuropathies Ms and today I'm

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,080
going to also be talking about

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,400
dementia um and what is dementia you had

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,080
discussions we all have definitions but

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,400
as a neurologist uh my feeling is that

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,120
the first thing you have to see about

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,840
dementia is reversible dementias so you

64
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,800
have somebody with cognitive side issues

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,360
at any age we have to look for

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,360
reversible dementias which are

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,959
potentially treatable here's a list of

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,879
them and this is called pseudo

69
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,519
depression of dementia when depression

70
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:57,239
is a is a common finding in patients

71
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,239
with cognitive decline especially stress

72
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,878
Related Disorders hydris Al alcohol

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,878
space occupying lesions uh being a brain

74
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,479
tumor specialist I'm very astute about

75
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,560
these issues metabolic diseases and I go

76
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,798
down that list so these are the

77
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,598
reversible dementias after we rule that

78
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,560
out then we say well what is dementia

79
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:18,639
it's a global sudden onset of decline of

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,920
cognitive functions resulting in

81
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,798
impaired ability to perform daily

82
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:27,079
activity that's dementia MCI and there's

83
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,799
about six million people in the United

84
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,080
States with dementia 12 million have

85
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,360
mild cognitive impairment which is some

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
cognitive effects but they still driving

87
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,959
going to work but they're coming up to

88
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,920
you and say hey I have M I have Uh

89
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,640
something's not right and we call those

90
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,199
individuals MCI but the majority of

91
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,679
dementias 80% is due to alzheimer's

92
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,719
pathology Alois Alzheimer was actually a

93
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,959
psychiatrist pathologist in Bavaria he

94
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,039
uh and uh he wrote the first article

95
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,120
called on a on a 60-year-old called

96
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,798
prile dementia uh with pathologic

97
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,079
confirmation

98
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,640
so interesting history I'm not going to

99
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,680
bore you with the whole thing because I

100
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,158
have to be on time but dementia is

101
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,879
Curren seventh leading cause of death in

102
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:16,719
the United States um 2019 dementia cost

103
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:19,599
about $1.3 trillion approximately 50% of

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,600
those costs are attributable to informal

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,439
carers so people who are taking care of

106
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,120
that five with supervision it's really a

107
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,680
devastating disease everybody here in

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,720
the audience knows somebody has somebody

109
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,000
who's going through dementia it is one

110
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,479
of the most sading things you can see

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,839
and everybody in our your age my age

112
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,879
also has the fear what's going to happen

113
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,159
in 10 years uh so women are

114
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,719
disproportionately affected by dementia

115
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,639
just not only directly but indirectly

116
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,240
because uh being caretakers historically

117
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,759
uh that's that's been a major issue so

118
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,478
when we talk about types of dementias

119
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,759
what's interesting not many people know

120
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,800
this that 60 70% of dementias are

121
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,960
actually

122
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,280
Alzheimer's by pathology by presentation

123
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,799
by Imaging by neuros psychometric

124
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,839
testing but what one doesn't know by the

125
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,639
age of

126
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:20,399
75 even if you're normal 35 to 40% of

127
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,319
people have pathologic changes of scal

128
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,159
Plax of neurofibrillary tangles in the

129
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,560
brain even though you may not have

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,479
manifestations of that disease so

131
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,560
there's frontal Temple dementia we used

132
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:34,719
to call that pix disease if for the

133
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,319
older Physicians Louis body vascular

134
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,160
dementia and mixed dementia so I'm also

135
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,520
a neurologist so I'm you know I do a lot

136
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,680
of research and imaging of neurological

137
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:48,478
diseases here's Alzheimer's disease

138
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,720
where classically you'll have priol lobe

139
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,758
and temporal lobe decrease in fluid oxy

140
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,759
glucose so alheim is really is medial

141
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,919
temporal hippocampal and pyob atrophy

142
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,840
and here's specca which is a poor man

143
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,079
pet scan and then Alzheimer is now we

144
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,119
have amalloy pet you can see the amid

145
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,038
accumulation on these cases this is

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,639
normal this is abnormal so now we do

147
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:17,839
have studies uh in Vivo uh premortem to

148
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,680
look at this and this is the classic uh

149
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,439
Progressive Aphasia similar to what our

150
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,400
uh a movie star has right now is

151
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,560
suffering from a phasic dementia where

152
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,279
you have left dominant temporal o

153
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,120
atrophy compared to the right and now

154
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,439
you can see the atrophy in the frontal

155
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,038
lobe so there's different variations of

156
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,000
this disease and this is vascular

157
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,360
disease just to show you what's

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,639
multi-infarct dementia due to multiple

159
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,520
Strokes could do it's a subcritical

160
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,000
dementia but still a dementia you see

161
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,598
The Strokes which are on flare studies

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,639
quite bright so the Continuum of all

163
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:52,598
disease preclinical the pathology is

164
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,879
present but there's no clinical symptoms

165
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:56,800
so in 7080 year olds you if you for

166
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,639
whatever reason they pass away from a

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,319
motor vehicle accident you'll see path

168
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,879
ology consistent with Alzheimer's

169
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,960
disease that's

170
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,800
preclinical uh MCI due to uh uh

171
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,519
Alzheimer's disease so these are

172
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,680
objective cognitive deficit no

173
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:15,000
meaningful compromise and then you have

174
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,079
mild moderate and severe dementias once

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
you're severe even moderate then

176
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:22,198
unfortunately there's not many things we

177
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,120
can do except uh uh paleo of care

178
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,000
unfortunately as you know nursing homes

179
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,120
T have a tendency to overutilize very

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,680
aggressive medications which increases

181
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,079
the more morbidity and mortality of

182
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,000
these elderly patients by putting them

183
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,560
on major tranquilizers such as cakil

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,038
which is common practice in nursing home

185
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,000
agitated cakil put them on cakl sedated

186
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,800
aspiration pneumonia they die it's a

187
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,598
little bit like a hospice care where

188
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,520
their terminal felt to be terminal the

189
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:56,719
average lifespan of an aler patient is

190
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:59,519
about 4 to 8 years um early uh also MCM

191
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,000
M dimensia 4.6 that's closer to 6

192
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,399
million MCI is about 12 million this is

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,360
the real problem I I do practice

194
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,198
medicine in Europe and they have the

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,319
same numbers same issues where

196
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,560
Alzheimer's disease is becoming probably

197
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,960
the most devastating disease in the next

198
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,959
20 years and for that reason research

199
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,439
has been focused on it and this is what

200
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,359
we're looking at ameloid beta and neurop

201
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,120
fiary Tangles that you see here distinct

202
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,319
in certain locations yes you could have

203
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,680
that in normal people but it really is

204
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,278
the frequency and the location

205
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,839
hippocampal amdel misal temperal lobe

206
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:39,679
singular gyrus these are the most common

207
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,640
places and currently a Amoy beta and to

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:46,000
uh and by biomarkers that you can check

209
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,480
for in the CSF so for patients now

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,480
treatments I'm going to just give this

211
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,480
one slide because people heard that

212
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,240
Biogen came out with this drug it was

213
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,920
approved a lot of people were quite

214
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,639
upset it cost about $440,000 a year and

215
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:02,120
the benefits of the of the drug were

216
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,679
really marginal at best and the

217
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,399
complication rate was about 35% where

218
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:10,439
had they had ARA

219
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,200
edema and they had also micro

220
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,240
hemorrhages so this drug was taken off

221
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,720
by Biogen by the way after criticism and

222
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,000
now this drug has been approved a lot of

223
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,240
other drugs we are studying at our

224
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,639
Institute uh for the treatment of uh a

225
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,519
disease which up to now had no treatment

226
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,480
so how can cannabis be potential

227
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,679
treatment but this is a study we did

228
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,320
several years ago just looking at

229
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:39,799
Patients over the from 75 to 103 we did

230
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,079
about 141 patients we gave him uh under

231
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,278
the New York State Medical Mar marijuana

232
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:47,759
program we gave him either you know the

233
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:49,639
20 to1 or choar one two or three and

234
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,439
then at the end of the day we looked at

235
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,000
this patient population just got a lot

236
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,600
of media exposure all around the world

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,480
because it they highlight highlighted as

238
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,120
grandma grandpa uh uh uh do well on pot

239
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,360
something like this some kind of you

240
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,600
catchy phrase but 69% of patient

241
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,519
reported symptomatic relief chronic pain

242
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,680
uh neuropathy I'm not saying anything

243
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,440
new you know uh uh Dr suak really

244
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,759
summarized it well with about the

245
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,160
positive effects in regards to pain and

246
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:27,360
anxiety 71 or 34% repir side effects but

247
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:30,039
those side effects really minimal and

248
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,759
few of those patients came off study

249
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:35,039
uh because of side effects and and U and

250
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:38,319
so this was a very positive looking at

251
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,439
this ELD geriatric population which by

252
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,120
definition already has neurop fiary

253
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,680
Tangles already has beta ameloid plaques

254
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,000
U pathologically and what's most

255
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,879
important is this number down here 32%

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,679
of patients uh really came off that now

257
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:55,278
my my practice is purely medical

258
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,359
marijuana I don't do recreational

259
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,320
marijuana even though it's proved in New

260
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,039
York state I have the 80-year-old

261
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,760
rheumatoid arthritis who does not want

262
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,759
to get high they just want to feel

263
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,838
better they want quality of life I think

264
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,559
everybody understands that perception um

265
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,560
here uh in this group so treatment

266
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,399
option well why is cannabis so

267
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,638
interesting because it's

268
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,720
anti-inflammatory it's neuroprotective

269
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,600
antioxidant and Pain Relief I was

270
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,839
thinking I'm going to the basic you know

271
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,920
biology or chemistry and it's you've had

272
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,279
that talk already today several times

273
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,240
and yesterday but postmortem studies

274
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:33,159
also shown that P paat s who suffer from

275
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,079
Alzheimer's disease had low levels of

276
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,439
anandamide which is very in and the

277
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,719
endoc cannaboid deficiency syndrome

278
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,760
described by Ethan Russo and lecturers

279
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
today is very interesting because we

280
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,799
never thought of Alzheimer's disease

281
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,360
having low anandamide levels maybe it's

282
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,359
a deficiency syndrome I do lecture that

283
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,959
a lot of neurological disorders are

284
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,399
deficiency syndromes let me give you an

285
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,559
example depression anxiety deficiency

286
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,919
nephrine and serotonin uh Parkinson's

287
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,159
disease is a deficiency in dopamine

288
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,360
Alzheimer's disease is a deficiency in

289
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:10,078
cocoline so there are deficiency

290
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,959
syndromes that we treat routinely um and

291
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,000
never thought that anandamide may be an

292
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,638
issue here these are some of the

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
advantages of canab Turin we do forget

294
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,600
about tpin uh and the we talk about the

295
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,839
Entourage effect but Turpin are very

296
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,920
important in many ways because for

297
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,399
example the most common tpine merine is

298
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:33,039
a very sedating drug just wrote a

299
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,879
article um with Pacific uh Research

300
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,759
Institute about the use of purely

301
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,039
mercine in

302
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:44,759
drivers and we blame THC for people who

303
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:47,719
drive 5 miles an hour uh and and the

304
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:50,360
reality is the study showed that Mercy

305
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,399
is far more sedating statistically in

306
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,680
drivers with effect at a driving uh

307
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,879
simulators that's what we use to p and

308
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,958
that was recently published just a mercy

309
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,600
so we do have to

310
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:04,719
strongly consider tpes as an issue here

311
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,879
but for for patients with migraines who

312
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,040
are agitated THC CBD obviously dose

313
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:13,720
dependent anxiety psychosis I do agree

314
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,039
that I do use THC in patients with

315
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,519
schizophrenia you have to dose it's dose

316
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,919
dependent I don't think it's a

317
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,639
contraindication but CBD more often in

318
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,759
psychosis insomnia I would put mercine

319
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,440
up there anorexia one of the side

320
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,559
effects in dementia patients is they

321
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,000
gain weight in my mind that's good

322
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,879
because patient patients with chronic

323
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,320
dementia lose weight aggression

324
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,320
depression pain memory and all these

325
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,720
things you see these these advantages of

326
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,839
different compounds um this is the

327
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,560
article it's outside I'm not going to go

328
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,079
through this this is a retrospective

329
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,119
study we actually saw 180 some patients

330
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,319
and then we looked at different

331
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,078
variations of side potential side

332
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,959
effects as well uh things that may help

333
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,078
their quality of life at the end of the

334
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,799
day out of 180 some patients we found

335
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:05,838
116 meeting the criteria uh 65% of

336
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:09,639
patients reported symptomatic improved

337
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,320
pain and sleep % reported which resolved

338
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,759
we really didn't have a person come off

339
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,759
study uh reductions in traditional

340
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,399
pharmaceutical this was very important

341
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,720
because a lot of these patients came off

342
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:24,000
drugs uh they may have been major

343
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,800
tranquilizers resp paradol cakil uh for

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,480
agitation um those patients on can so a

345
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,359
slower rate of decline so we did not see

346
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,839
any changes at six at five or six

347
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,039
months between the Middle mental state

348
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,360
examination Min mental test or Montreal

349
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:45,399
test for memory we did not see any

350
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,039
deteriation of the cognition demographic

351
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:52,360
this is the demographics 57% were female

352
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:54,958
43% male um and these are the report

353
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,039
Improvement as you can tell uh pain

354
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,439
Sleep Quality of Life issues uh

355
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:02,958
undoubtly family members felt there was

356
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,000
significant Improvement uh reported

357
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,078
address of X increased appetite I have

358
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,519
no problem with that uh and then

359
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,599
cognitive difficulty which is really

360
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,959
vague it was really not cognitive

361
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,278
difficulty uh but most patients did not

362
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,879
come off study so decreased epatite

363
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,879
report side effects

364
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:25,278
fatigue and then one asked what did we

365
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:30,519
use we used kovar type 1 in 44% of

366
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:32,958
patients and kovar type 2 in 37 % of

367
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:38,198
patients and the average dose is up here

368
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:39,599
THC 8.5 CBD 7.8 milligrams now I think

369
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:41,318
this is the most important thing

370
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,199
especially in today's world especially

371
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:47,360
in my world which is uh uh Hospital

372
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:49,479
based evaluations ER evaluations of

373
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,120
fental Overdose which unfortunately

374
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,039
often do not reach the hospital and we

375
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,278
noticed that in reduction of opiate in

376
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,399
the my chronic P migraine population

377
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:02,519
which we published 50% has a significant

378
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:05,360
at least 50% or complete reduction in

379
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,278
opioids trial neuralgia if you know what

380
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,680
that is that's a very painful syndrome

381
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:13,198
in the geriatric population 43% came off

382
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:17,838
their opioids or 50% decrease ELD was

383
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:20,399
32% Parkinson with 48% Ms was 38%

384
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,759
concussion post-traumatic head injury

385
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,839
38% uh and then this is a uh statistic

386
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,360
in regard to uh uh um um Caucasians was

387
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,600
African-American so the total number

388
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,879
when added is 163 over 490 not everybody

389
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,680
comes off that but uh uh it's a it's a

390
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:42,240
very uh enlightening number especially

391
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:47,039
in today's world we have over 120,000

392
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:50,278
patients a year dying from fental uh um

393
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,078
overdose so whether the texures capsule

394
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:55,318
maintain a value ratio 1 to 121 the

395
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:58,078
patients report Improvement independent

396
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,639
on the ratio 39 in our study anyhow the

397
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,198
reported side effect of patients were

398
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,959
minimal with fatigue side effects

399
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:07,480
largely subsided no statistical

400
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,839
significant in cognitive deterioration

401
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,279
which is very important and uh the

402
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,639
results from the den show that a medical

403
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,318
cannabis is well tolerated these are

404
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,280
concerns that regarding the cognitive

405
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:22,519
impacts and use of medicare's treatment

406
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:24,879
option so right now I have no not

407
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:28,480
inadequate science to say that medical

408
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,840
marijuana or cannabis is effective in

409
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,839
the aggression of the underlying disease

410
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:37,480
beta ameloid neurop fiary Tangles it

411
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:39,839
there's not enough studies to confirm

412
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,440
that as say I published an article on

413
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,558
Parkinson disease I have one out there

414
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,720
on ALS also that that's just enough but

415
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,839
when it comes to Quality of Life

416
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,079
unequivocally uh it's been

417
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,038
helpful while cannabis may offer

418
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,119
symptomatic relief and Co mobilities of

419
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:57,919
alers it is not a substitute for

420
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:59,918
evidence-based medical treatment now I

421
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,000
should qualify that because one could

422
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,280
critique the evidence-based uh treatment

423
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,679
we uh just before I got on stage I got a

424
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:11,158
call about a u Alzheimer patient who is

425
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,240
having problems with the use of two of

426
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,720
the drugs that I use often for the

427
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:21,000
treatment of of alzheim uh which in this

428
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:24,600
case was uh uh AOSP and amenda and we

429
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,720
are cocoline uh esteras Inhibitors uh to

430
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,480
increase the acetycholine in the brain

431
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,038
and they just don't tolerate it and I'm

432
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,519
not what the efficacy is but since the

433
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,240
you know last 15 years that's the only

434
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,759
drugs we were able to give to Alzheimer

435
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,079
patients and now that we have these new

436
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,679
uh monoclone

437
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,000
antibodies uh the world may change but

438
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,400
still any patient presenting you with

439
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,079
moderate to severe dementia it's just

440
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,440
too late the only way to treat these

441
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,798
individuals is catch them early probably

442
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:57,000
in the MCI stage confirmed that by

443
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:59,720
spinal taps pet scanning preferably

444
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,679
ameloid pet scanning and ALS o neur uh

445
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,319
neuros psychometric testing it's

446
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,919
premature to conclude that cannabis is

447
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,038
better treatment off for Alzheimer's

448
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,400
disease compared to the medication but

449
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:13,440
like I said in nursing's home if you

450
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,798
want to um help somebody along in their

451
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,679
course of life you put them on he heavy

452
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:20,000
tranquilizers because after you put them

453
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,720
on heavy tranquilizers their morbidity

454
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,519
and mortality will

455
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,038
increase I just want to uh real fast I

456
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:30,639
have uh chronic traumatic injury I also

457
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:34,158
was asked by by the um NFL to give them

458
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,520
a talk about CTE and use of cannabis

459
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,440
which was interesting this is a few

460
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,440
years before they changed the rules uh

461
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,279
caused by repeated severe concussions

462
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,320
you know a lot of the media is focused

463
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,678
on this a lot of these pro-athletes have

464
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,639
committed suicide offered their brain

465
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,919
for evaluation by a well-known

466
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,320
pathologist in Boston damaged the bra

467
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,640
cells military personnel and it's called

468
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,839
chronic traumatic inphy opathy advancing

469
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,919
neurod deugen disorder that is a

470
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:03,119
abundance of hyper phosphorated to

471
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,320
protein which similar to Alzheimer's

472
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,959
disease in fact uh this is just a

473
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:10,359
diagram of the difference there are t

474
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,400
tathy Alzheimer's cortical basil

475
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,479

477
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,079
called Richardson steel or shy

478
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:23,079
syndrome and neuroactive and this is

479
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,798
again I didn't get into the basics but

480
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,319
THC does reduce the preoptic release of

481
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,359
glutamate which is

482
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:31,200
excitatory uh which happens after

483
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,558
traumatic brain injury reduce

484
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,558
post-traumatic calcified influx in the

00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:40,279
mmdr regulat signal Pathways and in and

486
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:43,158
CBD inhibits the breakdown of our

487
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,639
endocannabinoid independent receptors

the mitochondria and anti-inflammatory

490
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:55,960
and so on so there is some theories why

491
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,840
we should be able to use uh THC CBD and

492
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,200
the in patients with degener generative

493
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:02,639
neurological disease not just

494
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,558
Alzheimer's disease but Parkin disease

495
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,000
ALS post-traumatic brain injury and CTE

496
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,519
neuroprotective cannaboids modulation of

497

stabilizing mitochondrial membranes and

500
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:21,359
I go through all this all this was

501
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,159
discussed in the previous meetings this

502
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:27,399
is just a slide summarizing uh these

503
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,720
effects now one of the things I've done

504
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,798
is is is as a physician who lived in the

505
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,079
world of uh academic medicine U being a

506
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:37,000
professor for many years in neurology

507
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,558
and

508
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,319
oncology um I took it upon myself in a

509
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:47,599
world of because the problem we have is

510
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:49,720
not Dr Russo Dr surlock Dr Goldstein

511
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,079
that's not the problem they're the gods

512
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,880
of cannabis research and Science and

513
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:57,399
treatment of human beings the problem is

514
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,840
our medical societies who are very

515
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,960
conservative and in general if you look

516
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,839
at each Medical Society you may belong

517
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,278
is the exception maybe the nurses who

518
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,759
are really forward thinking individuals

519
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:09,759
and think out of the box it's yeah yeah

520
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,480
you

521
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:16,119
could but the reality is our societies

522
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,839
are so conservative that on their

523
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,278
website they say you know what it should

524
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,119
desize it we agree with that we think

525
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:24,599
there's potential but you shouldn't use

526
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:27,879
it always ends up you should not be

527
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,399
using it and we use it every day because

528
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,520
not enough sign science not enough

529
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,038
randomized studies even though we know

530
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,200
about the politics and the history of

531
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:39,119
cannabis research so what I've done is

532
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,278
you know I've U lobbied in Washington go

533
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,519
down there every year talk to Schumer

534
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:47,960
talk to Pelosi tell them that why do we

535
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,679
need to have cannabis in our medical

536
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,159
armamentarium to treat human beings and

537
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,278
suffering and you know it's it's always

538
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,480
a difficult job you you know you waste a

539
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:59,440
three days down in Washington uh you got

540
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,200
to get dressed up like an idiot with a

541
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,720
green bow tie because that's neurology

542
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,759
green bow ties I I don't know why and

543
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,200
walk around in a pseudo tuxedo uh

544
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:14,519
talking to politicians who give you a

545
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:17,080
nanc uh so so uh this is very important

546
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:21,158
because it's really the we have to

547
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:23,278
change medicine not here not with us but

548
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,240
at the medical societies because once

549
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,240
they're on board and we all know why

550
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,519
they're upset they're upset because

551
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,000
people people in Colorado patients and

552
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:35,079
children changed the politics of

553
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,960
cannabis by bypassing the medical

554
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,678
societies they R right to the

555
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,679
politicians politicians saw a obvious uh

556
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,720
benefit to do something and all of a

557
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,440
sudden the medical soci say hey wait a

558
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,640
minute back off not enough written my

559
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,919
studies and so on and so on so this is a

560
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,440
real problem and that's why when I got

561
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,000
involved I try to legitimize the process

562
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,278
which was not always so difficult now

563
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,278
this is a uh you know I in I mentioned

564
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,919
that I I don't have any issues in regard

565
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:07,079
to uh my talk this is the only one I

566
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,200
just put in at the last moment and I had

567
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,079
a discussion with Dr uh Russo and the

568
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,480
question here is does the pharmakinetics

569
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:18,558
of a new drug with nanotchnology help in

570
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,679
the absorption and cmax T-Max so what I

571
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:25,119
plan to do is look at this new crossover

572
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,880
delivery system and see if if it helps

573
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,798
our patients in different neurological

574
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,120
dises specifically I'm going to look at

575
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,918
