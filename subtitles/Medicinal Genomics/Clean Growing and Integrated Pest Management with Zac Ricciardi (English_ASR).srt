83
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,360

90
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,600
that you know you are the person to talk

91
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,279
to and you are you are the guy when it

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
comes to IPM so I quickly jotted that

93
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,039

happy that you're here today um um so

96
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,080
maybe just to just to get us started

97
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,159
kind of set the scene tell us a bit

98
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:40,159
about your background how you got into

99
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,880
uh cannabis IPM and why it's uh

100
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,160
important so I kind of fell into

101
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,719
cannabis IPM almost out of necessity um

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,840
I've been in love with cannabis my

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,759
entire life and grew up in Colorado when

104
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,519
I turned 18 I uh basically moved out to

105
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,639
California to kind of Chase the you know

106
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:01,120
cannabis cultivator dream and operated

107
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,639
under SB for 20 and prop 215 in the

108
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,079
state of California for a while I was

109
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,840
able to kind of get on with the

110
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,959
gardening unlimiting crew who were the

111
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,239
guys that you know were basically

112
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,519
selling the supplies and that really

113
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,439
kind of kindled my passion for the you

114
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:16,639
know why not just uh you know the what

115
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,240
uh there's a lot of cannabis Growers

116
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,400
that follow charts but they never ask

117
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,000
why are we doing this and you know I

118
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,879
just kind of wanted to take that deeper

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,360
delve um originally being from Colorado

120
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,360
when our industry here started to you

121
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,759
know Snowball and blow up I had a lot of

122
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,639
people telling me that I needed to come

123
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:36,680
home and so I actually ran a smaller

124
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,280
hydroponic store in Golden Colorado for

125
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,519
I want to say about 2 years I ran it

126
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,799
from the day that it opened to the day

127
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,038
that it moved to Boulder um when the

128
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,000
owner decided that they were going to

129
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,879
relocate it was time for us to just kind

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,879
of separate paths and so I actually

131
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,800
painted bikes for Harley-Davidson for a

132
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,560
little while before I got on with a

133
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,800
company called ACW Supply here in Denver

134
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,680
Colorado um they are gold or uh

135
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,680
Colorado's oldest wholesale grower

136
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,360
Supply they've been around since 1893

137
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,639
three and being a counter guy there

138
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,720
really kind of jumpstarted my

139
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,639
IPM uh path I guess we could say because

140
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,840
I uh I was able to talk to many

141
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,478
different aspects of growers in a single

142
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,359
day and this is when cannabis was really

143
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,439
starting to snowball in Colorado but

144
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,439
being the counter guy I would talk to a

145
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,719
you know potato grower a poinsetta

146
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,000
grower and a hemp grower and a canabus

147
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,840
grower all in the same day and they all

148
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,839
had the same issue and so I was kind of

149
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,879
able to you know conglomerate that

150
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,038
knowledge and make suggestions across

151
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,959
different you know fields of horiculture

152
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,560
and say well you know this sector is

153
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,439
trying this this sector is trying this

154
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,560
and uh then Colorado came out with what

155
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,800
is called the approved list which is

156
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,478
basically a list of pesticides

157
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,560
fungicides bacteria sides that are safe

158
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,038
to put on a consumable crop like

159
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,918
cannabis and being in the very early

160
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,719
days being involved in seeing what that

161
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,279
list was looking like I was able to put

162
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,039
together a very comprehensive approach

163
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,038
for cannabis growers in a commercial

164
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:06,360
environment to rotate their chemistries

165
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,759
effectively so that they are able to

166
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,720
maximize their productivity and manh

167
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,199
hours because there's a lot of stuff on

168
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,160
these lists that's kind of misleading or

169
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,800
confusing and so being able to you know

170
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,720
again Emirate that Knowledge from large

171
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,280
scale Growers and be able to break down

172
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,319
an acre to you know a 4 by8 table really

173
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,799
help me out in terms of being able to

174
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,439
make some of this stuff understandable

175
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,319
for the industry and you know there was

176
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,360
a a long time ago there was this

177
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,400
mentality in cannabis where if you got

178
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,479
certain ailments you just chop down and

179
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,359
start over well you know traditional

180
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:40,800
Growers don't have that luxury and being

181
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,800
able to see that and say like you know a

182
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,158
cucumber grower can't clean out their

183
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,520
greenhouse because they got powdery

184
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,399
mildew and start from scratch they would

185
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,878
go bankrupt they have to have something

186
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,318
that could eliminate this powdery mildew

187
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,879
especially if they're organic certified

188
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,360
so there has to be a solution out there

189
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,439
we just hadn't found it yet and you know

190
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,598
being able to work with some of the

191
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,719
largest grows in the United States at

192
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:03,319
this point I feel that the biosafe sop

193
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,520
it does have some ins ciliary products

194
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,919
on there because I always say you know

195
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,799
I'd never hire an electrician to put in

196
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,560
a toilet for me we have the foundation

197
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,240
covered very very well and depending on

198
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,759
the unique scenario there are some ins

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,680
ciliary products from I don't

200
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,080
necessarily want to call them

201
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,038
competitors I will say other producers

202
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:23,158
of similar you know Organic pesticides

203
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,839
fungicides insecticides um they fit into

204
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:26,879
the program very well so that the grower

205
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,119
can be successful any one company that's

206
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,560
telling you that they have all the

207
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,560
answers is just trying to take your

208
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,038
money uh I think one of the reasons I

209
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,679
was probably brought up on this panel is

210
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,399
because I want Growers to be successful

211
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,199
I will often recommend things to

212
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,918
complement our program that biosafe

213
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,959
doesn't manufacture and that's because I

214
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,079
want you to be able to eliminate this

215
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,838
issue and also have that feather in your

216
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,040
cap so to speak uh because if this comes

217
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,680
up again you know what to do to come

218
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,159
full circle those Growers that their

219
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,919
mentality was to just chop down and

220
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,879
start over well the next time this

221
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:59,559
happens now you've lost two

222
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:02,600
crops right so now is your solution more

223
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,399
of a kind of reactive I have a problem I

224
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,680
need to address it is it or is it

225
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,159
preventative is it both I I always uh

226
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,958
you know preach preventative over

227
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,559
Curative but there are scenarios where

228
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:16,879
you know things find their way in and so

229
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,239
um in the book clean growing I do have

230
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,240
preventative measures as well as

231
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,039
Curative measures and the idea is that

232
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,320
Growers just get used to the idea of IPM

233
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,838
unfortunately it's kind of been the

234
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,560
redheaded stepchild of the industry and

235
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,040
it doesn't really matter until it

236
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,958
matters and then that's the only thing

237
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,319
that matters because Growers freak out

238
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,078
and they start spending a bunch of money

239
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,600
trying to eliminate issues that will

240
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:39,479
compromise the quality of their end

241
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,839
product where you know the the best plan

242
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,680
would be to have something in place

243
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,360
ahead of time stuff still Finds Its way

244
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,399
through ACS fail Lights Go Out people

245
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,159
quit you know there's insc silary stuff

246
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,519
that we always have to deal with beyond

247
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,319
what the plants are doing but you know

248
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:53,799
just like we have to water these plants

249
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,399
we also have to spray them and be that

250
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:57,319
intermediary because we've created a

251
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,839
perfect environment for these plants

252
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,519
we've also created a perfect environment

253
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,680
for pests because there's no natural

254
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,720
predation in these facilities and so a

255
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:09,319
rud AED a spider might a thrip Finds Its

256
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,560
way in that growth curve is exponential

257
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,320
unless we're spraying because they're

258
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,639
just going to grow unchecked so just

259
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,120
like we need to water these plants we

260
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,039
need to make sure that we have a program

261
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,879
in place to where we are that

262
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,399
intermediary to go after anything that

263
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,039
could find its way into the garden and

264
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,759
again you know recommending some other

265
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,360
company stuff with cannabis I really

266
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,399
only like to spray up until about week

267
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,440
three of flour unless it's absolutely

268
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,440
necessary at that point we can deploy

269
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,760
bcas which are our biological control

270
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,920
agents such as our beneficial insects or

271
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,319
nematodes basically using mother nature

272
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:42,799
to combat whatever else we could find in

273
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,920
that Garden um it allows Growers to

274
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,199
actually have a successful approach in

275
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,879
that aspect because they know what

276
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,680
they're targeting at that point if

277
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,360
you've been spraying these plants from

278
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,559
propagation all the way up until about

279
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,120
week three and you're in that

280
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,359
environment you know what kind of pest

281
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,360
you're dealing with so for example if

282
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,720
we're dealing with two dotted

283
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,959
spidermites you know that you need Pima

284
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,720
and californicus to be able to eliminate

285
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,559
that issue being in that garden and

286
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,440
spraying isn't just trying to eliminate

287
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:10,078
it it's also scouting it's prepping it's

288
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,880
note taking it's allowing you to

289
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,239
basically set up that next week for the

290
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,600
most amount of success that you can

291
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,079
possibly have and by you know basically

292
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,360
spraying up until that week three cut

293
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,078
off week three roughly it's it's when we

294
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
transition from stretching into setting

295
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:25,838
so there are some varieties it might be

296
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,479
a little later there are some varieties

297
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,639
it might be a little sooner but

298
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,200
basically we want to make sure that

299
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,399
we're addressing that wide array of

300
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,639
stuff that could find its way in because

301
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,278
while BCA work very very well Ben

302
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,480
they're specialized again plumbers put

303
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,078
in toilets electricians put in circuits

304
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,759
not all beneficial insects are going to

305
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:44,679
go after everything so when you see

306
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,919
people deploy ladybugs and they say they

307
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,439
have spider mes that's great that you

308
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,919
introduced a bunch of ladybugs and they

309
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,920
may eat some of those spider mites but

310
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,078
it's not a specialized food source for

311
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,319
that you know insect and so you're kind

312
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,759
of wasting money at that point by being

313
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,240
in the garden and having these notes and

314
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,360
knowing what happened last week you can

315
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,000
tell your approach next week so that you

316
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,200
are going to have the most success you

317
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,919
possibly can excellent all right before

318
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,480
we get too deep into it I'm hoping can

319
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,319
you explain or Define what is integrated

320
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,079
Pest

321
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,720
Management integrated Pest Management to

322
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:21,239
me is all things growing it's not just a

323
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,278
position that one person is assigned at

324
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,198
the Garden it's literally on the entire

325
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,919
team while there's one person that's

326
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:28,639
probably doing the sprays and doing the

327
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:31,719
logs and you know doing the heavy

328
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,639
lifting IPM is on everyone if we've got

329
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,040
a lazy team of trimmers and they go into

330
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,839
a dirty environment and then they go

331
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:41,000
into veg well then we just contaminated

332
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,320
veg so we have to educate the entire you

333
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,159
know Workforce that's at a facility at a

334
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,079
grow at a garden the IPM is on everybody

335
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,519
we have to move consciously we have to

336
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,319
think about what we're doing and we have

337
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,799
to try to eliminate cross-contamination

338
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,360
wherever possible you know we always go

339
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,719
to our cleanest areas first if we have

340
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,800
you know potential issues I always am a

341
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,480
you know proponent of using irrigation

342
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,639
marker Flags so that you can tell

343
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,120
everybody on the team that there's an

344
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,159
issue that you've spotted without having

345
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,560
to verbally say anything to anybody you

346
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,319
know anybody that walks into that room

347
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,518
if they see a red flag sticking out of a

348
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,639
pot whatever your facility deem the red

349
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,278
flag notates to they'll look at that and

350
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,159
say hey I need to avoid that area until

351
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,600
I'm done in this room that way I'm not

352
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,240
contaminating everything you know IPM is

353
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,360
is a cultural practice of cleanliness

354
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,799
across the board and it is a

355
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,680
preventative as well as Curative

356
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,639
approach to eliminate issues that could

357
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,039
you know possibly facilitate themselves

358
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,919
in a horiculture

359
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,719
environment and how does that differ

360
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,919
from like traditional pest control

361
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,199
methods really the only difference

362
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:44,759
between cannabis IPM and what we'll call

363
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:46,559
traditional IPM is the types of

364
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,919
chemistries that are used and the

365
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,159
longevity of said chemistries because

366
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,479
cannabis is a consumable most of the

367
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:55,639
stuff that is going to be sprayed on

368
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,639
cannabis is going to be uh what they

369
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,440
call grass or generally regarded as safe

370
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,360
um you're not going to see the longlived

371
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,639
systemic pesticides that they'll use on

372
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,360
ornamentals because they're poisonous um

373
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,799
I'm sure you know you've been around for

374
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,079
a long enough period of time everybody's

375
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,039
heard of Eagle 20 Eagle 20 is a

376
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,159
chemistry that is used in traditional

377
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:21,039
horiculture and it's not necessarily the

378
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:23,639
Boogeyman in that aspect because people

379
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,078
aren't combusting it Michel butol or

380
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,240
Eagle 20 really becomes dangerous once

381
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,559
it's lit on fire you create uh Benzene

382
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,240
and hydrocarbon once it's combusted and

383
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,078
so for a cannabis crop it's not a good

384
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,839
fit but if you were to spray it on your

385
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:39,359
leafy greens your Tomatoes whatever

386
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,839
because those are on the label it goes

387
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,000
through your digestive tract and it's

388
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,839
unchanged it doesn't have that carboxy

389
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,240
group basically it's it's like with thca

390
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,920
and Delta 9 you know how when you light

391
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,799
thca on fire it becomes you know Delta 9

392
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,078
UM same premise so you know having some

393
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,359
of these chemistries that are in

394
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,278
traditional Horticulture they're not

395
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,240
necessarily as safe and they don't have

396
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,078
the residuals so cannabis Growers have

397
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,600
to be a little bit more diligent and

398
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:07,278
educated in terms of what the spray that

399
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,839
they're doing right now is going to do

400
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,639
and how that next spray they're going to

401
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,079
do is going to either complement or

402
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,519
contradict what they just did for

403
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,319
example you would never want to spray a

404
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,919
biological inoculant and then spray a

405
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,399
sanitizer but if you did it in the

406
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,120
adverse and you sprayed a sanitizer and

407
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,679
then a biological inoculant the

408
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,039
inoculant will actually perform better

409
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,000
because you're putting it onto a clean

410
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:28,000
tissue environment where it can colonize

411
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,039
and spread much easier than if you were

412
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,480
to try to put it onto a dir environment

413
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,838
and then follow up with a sanitizer a

414
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,199
couple days later and kill all those

415
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,279
Sports so a lot of it is just the

416
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,000
rotation of certain chemistries and you

417
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,559
know making sure that you're using as

418
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,720
different a mode of action as we

419
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,119
possibly can we don't necessarily have

420
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,560
that same Iraq group classification that

421
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,799
traditional horiculture has where it

422
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,758
says this the IRA group three it does

423
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,519
this this and this this Ira group four

424
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,240
it does this this and this a lot of the

425
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,919
pesticides and fungicides that cannabis

426
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,680
Growers have are going to be contact or

427
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:01,439
very shortlived and so no knowing how to

428
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,278
play those off of one another so that

429
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,639
the grower has the most success allows

430
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,958
them to basically stack an IPM regimen

431
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,560
to where again every spray is compliment

432
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:13,758
in the one that preceded

433
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:16,239
it great so now integrated Pest

434
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,159
Management now do you include like plant

435
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,839
pathogens within that sort of definition

436
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,519
there so you know your hop and vroid and

437
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,279
um fusarium pythium all those sort of

438
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,039
things pest can be anything from you

439
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,360
know a single celled organism you know

440
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,879
viroids are very very small 25 to 50

441
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,480
nanometers in size all the way up to you

442
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:40,159
know bang aphids that are you know the

443
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,920
size of a a BB almost there's uh a whole

444
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,198
different schw of stuff that can attack

445
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,719
the plants and basically you know Pest

446
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:49,439
Management is going to be you being the

447
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,519
intermediary for everything from you

448
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,000
know the stuff you see to the stuff you

449
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:58,639
can't and so how how unique is sort of

450
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,318
the the program to each facility can is

451
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,318
there sort of a general uh protocol that

452
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:06,078
they should be following or is it very

453
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,318
specific so in the the book I I have

454
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,438
what I kind of call the recipe for bread

455
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:14,119
which is just the basic outline of the

456
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,959
rotation of a growth regulate style

457
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,599
chemistry which is more than likely

458
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,600
going to be Aid duratin in cannabis what

459
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,958
I like to call The Heavy Hitters which

460
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,519
are going to be your MCO insecticides

461
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,200
like your Bavaria basana your bur Alura

462
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,599
your assaria fosa uh your metah harium

463
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,080
chemistries and then on Fridays just so

464
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,519
we can keep the pressure on the button

465
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,038
so to speak and depending on the

466
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:39,200
scenario that's when we would use either

467
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:41,798
like a sulfur a citric acid or possibly

468
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,480
an insecticidal soap and so each

469
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:44,879
scenario is is a little bit different

470
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,038
but it allows the grower to basically

471
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,360
tailor their approach to best fit what

472
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,079
they're dealing with at that point in

473
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,879
time and because the base of the program

474
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:54,759
really doesn't change a whole lot it

475
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,960
allows them to be able to make minute

476
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:59,319
changes while still staying on you know

477
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,720
the same basic premise so that you know

478
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,720
your guys aren't saying like oh we did

479
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,839
this this last week and now we're over

480
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,360
here doing something completely

481
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,439
different you know there's there's a few

482
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,759
minute changes that occur but the nice

483
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,360
thing about it is that it's broad enough

484
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:12,200
that it can address most of the issues

485
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:14,240
that we're trying to do and again if

486
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,558
we're doing this as a preventative then

487
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,240
we don't have to get into that

488
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:18,399
necessarily specialized section of it

489
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,919
where it's like okay we're dealing with

490
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,919
russet mites specifically or we're

491
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,759
dealing with rude aphids and that's when

492
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,320
we make little changes but you know for

493
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,879
a general just overview sop of just

494
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,558
trying to keep things clean it it's

495
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,520
pretty Universal

496
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:34,759
right so no I'm glad you said that so

497
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,440
because I know I mean in in researching

498
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,679
kind of IPM there's all these articles

499
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,640
that kind of talk about the the

500
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,559
different tenants of it and it can be

501
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,280
anywhere from four to six to whatever

502
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:45,399
but I know that one of the the main ones

503
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,519
is the whole idea of identification in

504
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,080
modur in which is sort of like what you

505
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:53,720
had talked about before so what are um

506
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:56,000
some of the signs that um Growers should

507
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,880
be looking for to in order to sort of

508
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,798
identify a problem before it you know

509
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,159
Ball's out of control you know um one

510
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,279
thing that I always try to have Growers

511
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,000
do is Empower their staff because a

512
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,720
grower is only one person and there in

513
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,880
any given facility there's thousands of

514
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,400
plants possibly but you have people that

515
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,440
are looking at those plants every single

516
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,759
day Empower your staff to come to you

517
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,720
they don't need to be an expert

518
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,319
necessarily but they know when

519
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,880
something's not right if that plant

520
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,359
looks different than it did yesterday

521
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,919
have them come tell you and then you can

522
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,759
figure it out you know it's it's one of

523
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,759
those things that if you don't allow

524
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,960
your staff like I don't want you to have

525
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,720
your staff think that they're making a

526
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,480
mistake you know what I'm saying like a

527
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,000
lot of times people will not go and tell

528
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,000
the head grower that something's a Miss

529
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,640
because they don't want it to come back

530
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,440
on them like oh well then you did this

531
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,400
type of thing Empower your people to say

532
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,640
like if there is anything that's off

533
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,720
let's figure it out you know if this

534
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,520
plant looks different than it did

535
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,798
yesterday if it's got purple stems if

536
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,480
it's got stippling on the leaves if the

537
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,798
you know turgidity is gone and the

538
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,599
leaves are starting to curl down if

539
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,759
they're starting to curl up like

540
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:02,279
anything that just looks a miss

541
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,599
your how do I put it like you don't

542
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,279
necessarily have to have a team of

543
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,599
Master Growers you just got to have a

544
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,399
team of diligent people and as long as

545
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,719
there's one person on staff that you

546
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
know can say like okay there's an issue

547
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,519
let me go see it like most facilities

548
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,679
have one maintenance guy that fixes AC's

549
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,359
it's not on everybody to do it so if you

550
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
have one guy that's responsible for

551
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,519
plant health and pathogen mitigation

552
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,440
when somebody finds something he can say

553
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,720
hey I got to go tell Ben what I just

554
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,200
found and you know it could be that they

555
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,880
topped it funny it could be that it's

556
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,919
hlv it could be that there's an actual

557
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,120
issue going on beyond that you know but

558
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,440
having the ability and that

559
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,519
communication between your team is

560
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,679
Paramount uh because those are the guys

561
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,038
that are in the trenches so to speak and

562
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,440
you know you got to empower your team to

563
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,679
let you know what's going on because

564
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,600
again the head grower is only in one

565
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,120
spot at one time and having the ability

566
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:51,319
to have a team that can relay real world

567
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,719
information to you uh you know very

568
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,200
quickly helps a lot that flag system

569
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,960
that I was mentioning a little bit that

570
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,000
really helps a lot because a head grower

571
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,720
can stick his head in a room and count

572
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,480
Flags in 30 seconds and that's a great

573
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,279
way to you know also track progress if

574
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,480
we had 10 red flags last week and this

575
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,798
week we're down to five then what we're

576
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,679
doing is working you know we need to

577
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:12,079
continue on that process that we have

578
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,600
implemented if we were at 15 red flags

579
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,759
this week and last week we only had 10

580
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,000
then we need to switch it up because

581
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,640
it's getting worse and so it's it you

582
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,159
know communication is I think the most

583
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,278
important part of integrated Pest

584
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,360
Management to

585
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:25,720
me yeah the communication definitely

586
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:29,119
seems important and like you said it's

587
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,000
it's a culture right and um so how

588
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,038
common is that the culture in in

589
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,240
cannabis cultivation like is it is it

590
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,319
becoming more of a thing I see more and

591
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
more operations becoming more and more

592
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,678
regimented in terms of how they do

593
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,080
things and whether it's state

594
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,919
regulations that have kind of

595
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,879
facilitated that change or people just

596
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,520
realizing that they have to run leaner

597
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,400
because the market isn't what it was um

598
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,960
having the ability to educate staff and

599
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,038
you know get them all on the same page

600
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,400
and Empower people I think is the way

601
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:01,839
that the successful grows are going if

602
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,840
you punish your employees for trying to

603
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,000
do their best they're not going to want

604
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:07,119
to work for

605
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,038
you right right all right I want to talk

606
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,079
to you about some of like what are some

607
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,919
of the common pests or problems that

608
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,119
cannabis Growers just always seem to be

609
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,720
dealing with I would say the uh four

610
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,439
most common things that I run into

611
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,159
traveling the country are going to be

612
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:27,480
thrips rude AIDS hop and vroid and

613
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,440
powdery mildew thrips can be kind of a

614
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,240
problem because a lot of times folks

615
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,240
will only attack one life cycle stage of

616
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,960
this infestation thrips actually have a

617
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,960
point where they live in the canopy and

618
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,519
they have a point where they live in the

619
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,798
strata of your media and so if you're

620
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,200
not treating both you're going to see

621
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:43,639
these es and flows where they're gone

622
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,240
for two weeks they come back they're

623
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,320
gone for two weeks they come back and so

624
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,240
you know educating Growers that doing a

625
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,519
sprunch application with thrips really

626
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,319
does allow them to get ahead of it uh

627
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,679
rude aphids are extremely hard to get

628
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,678
rid of just because they're incredibly

629
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,679
Adept at what people have been throwing

630
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,559
at them um um what I've found to be the

631
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,600
most effective method to attack root

632
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:05,639
AIDS is to actually do an irrigation

633
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,839
cycle before you do any drenches or

634
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,278
sprays they run away from that moisture

635
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,839
of the first irrigation cycle of the day

636
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:13,159
if we can get those pots wet and get

637
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,918
them complacent to the fact that that

638
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:16,760
moisture is there they're less apt to

639
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,038
try to run away and so whatever we're

640
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,919
putting out via a drench sprunch or

641
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,558
spray is going to have much better

642
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:23,360
likelihood of actually coming in contact

643
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,839
with them because they're not just

644
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:29,119
trying to run from it um pop and vroid

645
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,319
is something that uh

646
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,399
a lot of Growers have it but they don't

647
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,839
know they have it until they have it and

648
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,519
again this comes back to that cultural

649
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:38,119
practices thing and you know kind of

650
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:40,038
falls on everybody and just the

651
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:43,319
communication that vroid can be

652
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:45,440
transferred via dirty matter it can be

653
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,879
transferred mechanically so it grow goes

654
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
from one plant to another doesn't wash

655
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,520
his hands it can be spread by tools it

656
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,480
can be spread by runoff it can be spread

657
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,720
by insects is a very prevalent pathogen

658
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,200
and a lot of folks don't take it as

659
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,558
seriously as they should there are some

660
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,240
grows that have completely realized that

661
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,038
it can decimate their business and they

662
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,720
will test their moms before they take

663
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,879
Cuts every single Round And they're

664
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,159
they're doing everything they need to

665
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,120
and then there are Growers that still

666
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,679
use a single cup of clonex and dip every

667
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,639
single cut in that same hormone and it's

668
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,519
like if if there's any contamination you

669
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,360
guys just spread it across the board so

670
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:24,200
you know honestly I feel like the the

671
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:26,038
viroids and pathogens are going to be

672
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,480
the hardest thing for the Cannabis

673
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:28,679
industry to address because you don't

674
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,519
know that you have them and until you

675
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,399
have them and once you have them we can

676
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,639
go into remission so to speak we can you

677
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:36,599
know get it to a point where the plant

678
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,559
can still finish but those genetics are

679
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,639
contaminated at that point and to keep

680
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,119
them on board would be to you know

681
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,559
facilitate the downfall of everything

682
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,119
else that you have in your stable

683
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,918
because again that can transfer so many

684
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:52,079
different ways and so easily and the

685
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,919
thing that a lot of grower the latent

686
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,278
portion of this virid if your plants are

687
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,480
healthy you're not going to see what it

688
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:59,759
can do right away but over time the

689
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,839
plant Health starts to go down it's

690
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,720
almost like cancer or you know the the

691
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,158
patient isn't necessarily bedridden when

692
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,360
they're first diagnosed but the longer

693
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,720
they are alive that line goes like this

694
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,839
and the sicker they become and you know

695
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,640
to compromise an entire business with

696
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,480
hlv is just it's very scary because it

697
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,120
will compromise your Harvest your THC

698
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,880
percentages blumm it your bag appeal

699
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:22,519
goes down and the medicinal value of the

700
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,000
plant is just not there anymore you know

701
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,158
you're basically growing hemp at that

702
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
point like you're compliant with the

703
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,480
farm bill

704
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:34,359
almost um the uh I'm sorry the no I I

705
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,440
never thought of it that way the uh the

706
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:40,599
last you know most common pathogen that

707
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,640
I see is powder Milo just because it is

708
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,000
very prevalent it's easy to pop up it's

709
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,640
not the end of the world a lot of times

710
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,440
Growers won't do everything they need to

711
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,720
do to eliminate said issue but uh it is

712
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,759
something that can be gotten rid of

713
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,798
Fairly easily um first thing I always

714
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,879
tell people is make sure your

715
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,119
environment's on point if you can't set

716
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,840
your temp to 60 and your de to 10 and

717
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,439
then hit those numbers your environment

718
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,119
isn't where it needs to be you know

719
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,600
there there are folks that say oh I can

720
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:08,038
get it to where it needs to be and if if

721
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,839
you can't hit those parameters it's not

722
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:11,558
and so the first thing Growers have to

723
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,398
do is make sure that their HVAC is up to

724
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:15,960
point their you know air conditioning is

725
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:17,678
up to point their deu is where it needs

726
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,278
to be and if they're still experiencing

727
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,720
powdery Meo that's when we say okay

728
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,038
let's look at what we can spray to you

729
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,480
know basically kind of hinder this thing

730
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,519
in its tracks and we've got some really

731
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,440
cool options for cannabis Growers that

732
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:32,960
have uh you know very safe application

733
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,919
uh methods and you know zero residual

734
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,558
aspects in terms of dangerous stuff um

735
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,480
and you know it just allows them to

736
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:41,678
basically get on that schedule of like

737
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,880
okay it's it's flip we got to spray oxy

738
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,720
fos and zerol or you know it's Wednesday

739
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,720
we got to hit a a Mico

740
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,600
insecticide and you know to touch on

741
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,399
what you kind of said earlier in my

742
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,558
program Monday Wednesday Friday for

743
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:56,839
preventative is spray days Tuesday and

744
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,720
Thursday is plant work and scouting and

745
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,398
then once we get uh from you know

746
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,640
basically Curative into preventative I'm

747
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:04,798
sorry I said that wrong I said

748
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,600
preventative but I meant Curative um

749
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,398
once we get into the preventative mode

750
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,119
we actually flip it and Monday Wednesday

751
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:12,439
Friday we're doing scouting Tuesday

752
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:15,000
Thursday we're doing our sprays um but

753
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,519
the idea is that you're in there looking

754
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,278
at the plants as much as you're spraying

755
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,079
or defoliating or doing anything else

756
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:21,839
because we have to evaluate our progress

757
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,199
and you know keep a lot of logs if if we

758
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,918
don't write down what we're doing in a

759
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,360
month we won't remember what we did we

760
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,919
don't know if we did anything right or

761
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,000
not you know grows are very cyclical in

762
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,679
terms of what happened last June likely

763
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,119
is going to happen this June and so if

764
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:36,038
you can go back to your log last year

765
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,439
and say we had thrips on the 14th

766
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:38,759
when it got really hot and then you look

767
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,880
at your calendar and you say okay it's

768
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,000
going to get up to you know 102 or

769
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,320
whatever I'm anticipating thrips you

770
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,319
could put out your ambelas cucumeris you

771
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:49,398
know beneficial insects and later flour

772
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,759
and then do your sprays and your veg and

773
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:53,479
your prop and your early flour and

774
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,079
combat the you know thrips before they

775
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,798
ever even get

776
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,960
established right no I wanted to go back

777
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:01,200
to when you were talking about the

778
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,919
pathogens and you know it sounded like

779
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,960
one of the main challenges with that is

780
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,480
you don't really know you have it until

781
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,240
it's too late so in in that sense do you

782
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,000
sort of advocate for you know uh regular

783
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:18,120
testing um full disclosure uh medicinal

784
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,599
genomics we we develop qpcr aades for HL

785
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:23,439
and vroid cerium pythium a lot of the

786
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,519
plant pathogens that uh folks use and

787
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,919
you know we're trying to spread the word

788
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,558
to Growers that you know should make

789
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,000
that part of their program to to do

790
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:31,599
testing is that something that you would

791
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,319
agree with definitely every other aspect

792
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,000
of horiculture that is uh traditional

793
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,398
does tissue testing if you go to a

794
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,119
tomato grower Greenhouse they're doing

795
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:40,359
it once a week they don't know how to

796
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,759
adjust their feeds if they don't know

797
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:44,719
what the plant's uptaking and what it's

798
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,319
not and you know it that's nutritional

799
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,440
analysis but being able to have this

800
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,079
pathogen testing is Paramount if you

801
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,320
have a dirty genetic and you put you

802
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:56,079
know 2,000 clones into production that's

803
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,158
a loss because that 2,000 clones with

804
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,918
the where where the market is now you're

805
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,120
going to spend more money labor and time

806
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,799
then you're going to be able to recoup

807
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,000
off of that crop at that point if you

808
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,319
can even sell it because it's not going

809
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,599
to come out looking like it should um

810
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,119
I'm an advocate of you know having a

811
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,038
test allows us to make educated

812
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,558
decisions if we don't know what we're

813
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,398
dealing with then we're just throwing

814
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,038
stuff at the wall to see what sticks

815
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,719
every time you cut clones if you bring

816
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,398
in something new you know even quarterly

817
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,880
test your your stable just to make sure

818
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,278
everything is where it's supposed to be

819
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,200
but anything that comes in brand new

820
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,798
should always be quarantined and tested

821
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,919
and then those you know plants should

822
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,879
have clones cut off of them and as long

823
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,799
as those clones off of the plants you

824
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,000
brought in look okay then we can put it

825
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,278
into production but I that's a mistake

826
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,960
I've seen time and time again where

827
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,759
Growers are excited to get some hype

828
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,558
genetic they put into production right

829
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,839
away and then they're like you know

830
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:48,759
I just infected half of my stable with

831
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,519
XYZ right no and now going back to the

832
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:53,440
pests um another thing that I sort of

833
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,679
saw in my research too is this sort of

834
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,558
this idea of setting thresholds so is

835
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,720
there like a certain amount of pest

836
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,240
that's sort of like okay as long as we

837
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,159
can manage it and you know keep it down

838
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,480
or I mean in a perfect world brother the

839
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,880
the perfect number would be zero but

840
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,679
this is farming and we're in a fluid

841
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,159
environment where you've got people

842
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,919
coming in and out of the facility all

843
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,440
day long you know depending on the type

844
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,240
of facility if it's a greenhouse every

845
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,640
time you open your louvers to ventilate

846
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,480
the greenhouse we've potentially

847
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,278
introduced contamination and so the the

848
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,640
m and IPM stands for management you're

849
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:28,880
never going to completely be ahead of

850
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,919
everything you will always have

851
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,679
something to do the next day because

852
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,000
nature never quits you know it will

853
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,919
always try to find its way in or you

854
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,519
know do its best to stifle what it is

855
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:45,720
we're trying to do and so you know the

856
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:47,399
acceptable level is low pressure but you

857
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,480
know don't get complacent and say oh we

858
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:50,959
we've got mites but they're not that bad

859
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,480
you know we've got mites but we're

860
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,278
treating them as the right approach once

861
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,079
you get complacent with something that's

862
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:59,240
when other issues start to snowball and

863
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,359
so low pressure isn't unaccept able but

864
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,359
you know make sure that you're doing

865
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,839
your best to get that to as close to no

866
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,678
pressure as you can and again because

867
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:08,079
it's farming if we wipe one issue out

868
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,440
Ben something else is going to pop up

869
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,720
tomorrow that's just the nature of the

870
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,600
Beast yeah yeahh all right so winding

871
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,319
down here I'm curious you know are there

872
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,959
some common mistakes that Growers make

873
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:21,798
when they're implementing IPM that they

874
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,360
could avoid the most common mistake that

875
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,918
I see is that Growers don't necessarily

876
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,879
look at active ingredients they're just

877
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:29,480
looking at brand names and so you know

878
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,880
you know one time I went to a facility

879
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,839
here in Denver and the grower had

880
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,720
clarified hydrophobic extract of neem

881
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:39,599
oil as a duratin and Ne oil and those

882
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,440
are all basically the exact same thing

883
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,879
just different versions of the exact

884
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,000
same product and he was wondering why he

885
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,440
wasn't having success with his issue and

886
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,480
it's like well brother you're using

887
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,720
three versions of the same stuff you

888
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,360
know being able to differentiate between

889
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,079
actives really allows Growers to get

890
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:59,398
those different modes of action and you

891
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:01,359
know making sure that uh they are phing

892
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:02,599
their sprays at the end of it is

893
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,439
something that I've seen some Growers

894
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:07,398
neglect to do like they'll pH their

895
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,360
reservoirs every time but they won't pH

896
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:10,959
their sprays for whatever reason I feel

897
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,199
like that sometimes is

898
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,120
a a whoopsy and uh the other thing that

899
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,319
I I see a lot of Growers do man and this

900
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:20,079
is not knocking anybody but you know

901
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,638
water quality isn't necessarily the best

902
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:25,278
in some places of the country so Growers

903
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:27,000
will spray with Aro water and uh Aro as

904
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,519
you know is acidic comes out of the

905
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,079
machine at 7 but you let it sit for 24

906
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,319
hours it's going to be a pH of something

907
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,960
like 5'5 and then they add something

908
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:37,319
like citric acid to it it's going to be

909
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,639
a pH of something like three you spray a

910
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,200
pH to three on your plants man you're

911
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:42,678
going to see some phyto and burn some

912
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,278
stuff and so uh what I typically

913
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,440
recommend to Growers is if you've got

914
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:49,519
really dirty water and you cannot spray

915
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,759
with tap take some of your base NPK

916
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,240
spike it to about3 EC get a little bit

917
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:56,240
of that bicarbonate content from that

918
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,880
fertilizer back into that water column

919
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,079
and that way if you do have to buffer it

920
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,039
or add something else to it it's not

921
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,079
going to have the DraStic swings that it

922
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:06,000
would without that bicarbon in content

923
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,720
anytime Growers are spraying zerol I

924
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,119
tell them if you're use an R spike it

925
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,278
to. 3 EC and they add the zerol and nine

926
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,319
out of 10 times it'll fall between 55

927
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,319
and

928
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:21,079
62 which is for a f year

929
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:23,480
app um so looking ahead uh are there any

930
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,960
advancements or innovations that you're

931
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,519
excited about when it comes to

932
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,639
IPM uh definitely you know the the realm

933
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:36,200
of mro insecticides is continuing to

934
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:38,199
expand uh the nature against nature

935
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,639
really is my favorite approach Mother

936
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,558
Nature has been doing this a lot longer

937
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:43,439
than we have and you know she's got

938
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:46,599
checks and balances for everything so

939
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,399
being able to utilize more natural

940
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:50,240
products and get further away from

941
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,638
petrochemicals and you know stuff that

942
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,759
harms pollinators and hurts the

943
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:56,918
environment really is going to I think

944
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:59,319
allow Pest Management to be looked at as

945
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:00,919
not necessarily this big Boogeyman like

946
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:02,720
anytime you hear the word insecticide

947
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,759
pesticide people always think Monsanto

948
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,519
Round Up cancer and it's like there's to

949
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,800
farm on scale you have to be able to be

950
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,480
that intermediary but we don't

951
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,919
necessarily have to use those

952
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,398
chemistries that poison the planet you

953
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,918
know biosafe are montras to try to leave

954
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:17,759
the planet better than we found it man

955
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,398
and you know we're able to address a lot

956
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,760
of these issues that these gnarly

957
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:24,878
chemicals address we do it without

958
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,720
hurting the environment and so I in the

959
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,878
future I'm just excited to see more of

960
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,598
these really cancerous you know gnarly

961
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:33,838
chemistries be replaced by stuff that

962
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,240
works that is safer for the planet and

963
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:39,799
for people excellent all right and

964
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,719
Before I Let You Go um are there any

965
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,679
other resources besides your book which

966
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,000
I will put a link to in the show notes

967
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,639
so people can uh can find that on Amazon

968
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,838
but are there other resources papers or

969
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,760
anything like that that you could

970
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,440
recommend uh that if people are

971
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,359
interested in learning more about uh

972
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,440
what do you do um we definitely have uh

973
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:03,119
you know really good uh Instagram page

974
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,960
if you go on to the igtv tab uh when the

975
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,079
P pandemic first started I used to do

976
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,280
these things called Fireside Chats where

977
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,280
I would just talk about a different

978
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,200
aspect of cultivation it has everything

979
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,079
from trimming to curing to you know

980
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,358
russet mites and rude aphids like

981
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:19,280
