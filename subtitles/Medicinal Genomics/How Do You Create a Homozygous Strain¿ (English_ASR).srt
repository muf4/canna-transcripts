[Music]

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,560
so so what's your approach to creating a

3
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:25,479
homozygous um strain sure so we are also

4
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,518
a tissue culture laboratory so something

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,079
unique that we do everything's in vitro

6
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:33,000
so everything grows in cryo it's never

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,000
watered it's never fed it's never

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,320
touched it's never looked at for up to a

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,960
year at a time and because of this uh

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,840
we've been able to really really

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,239
maintain a large Vault of different

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,920
genetics we have about 2,000 strains

13
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,718
that we've hunted um from about 20

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,000
countries now the USA being one um and

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,280
so we get these um into their vessels

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,600
where they go through either a

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,640
multiplication phase or a rooting phase

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,679
but more importantly

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,280
100% sterile so we're able to sterilize

20
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,359
these genetics uh implementing aicle

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,079
maristone tissue culture we can get them

22
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,159
back to their generation zero uh which

23
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:15,679
is going to return that actual tissue

24
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,600
that plant that genotype to its original

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,240
Vigor um so we take a sterile approach

26
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,879
and then when we go to create a new line

27
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,239
we can pull from that Vault we get that

28
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,679
out of tissue uh we start What's called

29
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,280
the acclamation phase getting it used to

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,240
being out of that 100% relative humidity

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,200
vessel and then getting it into our

32
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:40,158
inbreeding Chambers uh we then will take

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,719
that specific strain and we will inbreed

34
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,439
it and we get it to about an S4 when we

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:50,000
get to an S4 we then get it back into

36
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:52,239
vitro and we hold it in that S4 um stage

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,438
so that when we come across another line

38
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,959
that really really checks all the boxes

39
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:00,599
for us we then do the cross there um and

40
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:04,559
so we're creating stabiliz ized

41
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:06,640
Offspring um in seed form um and yeah I

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,319
mean that's kind of our approach but we

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,560
also take that plasticity approach um

44
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:13,479
something very very unique that we're

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,640
doing and I've done an also traditional

46
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,919
a is we are taking I'll give you an

47
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,318
instance an example of how we do this

48
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:26,280
plasticity breeding in 35 gallon tubs we

49
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:29,399
are propagating and growing um fungus

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,080
larae we Harvest this fungus larae with

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,400
wire mesh and then we practice what we

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,840
call targeted releases so we might go

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,039
into one breeding chamber and we'll

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,439
disperse this larve and from start to

55
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,400
finish we're able to find that specific

56
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:48,280
genotype that shows the most resistance

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,800
towards that specific plant pressure uh

58
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,080
in this case being a fungus knat uh you

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,239
know they start in that larvae stage but

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,840
then they evolve into that adult mobile

61
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,120
stage where they're landing on your

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,560
plants they're eating the foliage

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,319
they're causing damage to your canopy

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,640
and so we're able to take that genotype

65
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,919
isolate it and then bring that over to

66
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,238
the next generation and breed again and

67
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,359
again and again and we're constantly

68
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,719
hunting for that genotype that has the

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,680
most resistance towards that plant

70
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:24,919
pressure wow so you are purposely

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,680
introducing uh a pest in this case right

72
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:28,878
to try to identify the plants that have

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,360
the trait that you're looking for that's

74
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,560
right and we're we're a completely

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,640
sealed facility so U I hope so yeah UVC

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,920
filtered HEPA filtered so we don't

77
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,479
really have too many past pressures that

78
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,318
come into our facilities but we're able

79
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:47,280
to control what does come in and then

80
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,639
create such such a high density of that

81
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,158
specific plant pressure that's allowing

82
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:55,318
us to do these inbs and we do this with

83
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:58,078
spider mites aphids uh we buy spores a

84
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,280
PM uh and we do this with every Garden

85
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,719
pressure um that a gr is going to

86
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,598
experience so that they have the

87
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,039
greatest tailored Offspring when it

88
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,639
comes to growing and so you do it with

89
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,798
all those different pathogens for every

90
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,559
line no so we have a Target right so

91
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,360
every strain there's a Target we might

92
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,918
do a PM Target and then we're also you

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,079
know hunting for yields or we're hunting

94
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,560
for tpin or canabo so there's always a

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,280
different Target um you know you go and

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,199
try to Target everything in one strain

97
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,839
it it would take so much longer to

98
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,600
achieve that um and then in many cases

99
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,599
you're kind of fighting one with the

100
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
other

101
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:50,009
