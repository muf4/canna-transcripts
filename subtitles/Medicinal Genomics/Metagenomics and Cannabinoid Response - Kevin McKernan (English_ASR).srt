1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,039
all right thank you very much

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,559
uh so uh i'm gonna speak about

3
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,079
metagenomics and capability response and

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,439
it's a big reach right now but hopefully

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,960
by the end of this i'll i'll convince

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,519
you that they're actually connected

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,880
uh so uh over a decade ago we started

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,160
sequencing the human genome across the

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,198
river a few people in this room were

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,640
involved in building

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,279
a uh a robotic field to basically

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,880
uh construct two football fields worth

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,159
of robotics it was in east cambridge

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,000
because the real estate was cheap and

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,000
that's an important point um

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,920
now that took us several years to build

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,520
the robots but in 10 months those robots

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
finished sequencing 40 million e coli

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,960
clones and we spent painstaking efforts

20
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,320
to make sure there wasn't any microbial

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,039
contamination in the human genome

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,558
reference

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,000
and that was important so that after the

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,839
human genome was complete we could then

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,359
study the effect of microbiomes on human

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,879
health and we needed human reference to

27
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,479
screen that stuff out

28
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,159
well everyone's probably familiar with

29
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,599
the mice transplantation experiments

30
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,599
where you can actually transplant

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,198
obesity from one mice to its twin by

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
moving the microbiome over

33
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,640
so it's very clear that this has a

34
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,158
profound impact on human health and we

35
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,239
need to understand these genes

36
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,439
there are more microbial genes on your

37
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,640
body than your own

38
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,039
but they're different genes they don't

39
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,519
have a lot of exon intron splicing going

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,880
on

41
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,158
so they don't argue we don't produce as

42
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,599
many proteins but they're still

43
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,280
nevertheless more cells that are

44
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,280
microbial in your body than human

45
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,478
so we want to pay attention to uh to the

46
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,200
microbiome now

47
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,239
fast forward to 2000 and oh i think i've

48
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,079
missed a particular

49
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,000
slide there but if you fast forward to

50
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,359
actually 2010 to look at cannabis

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
genetics i'm just going to step in here

52
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,118
and see if i can

53
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
resurrect that you'll see something that

54
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,799
doesn't look

55
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,439
as if it is that modern let me see if

56
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,200
this will

57
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:45,839
surgery will prevail here well

58
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
it won't so uh anyway what we see today

59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,200
uh if you saw the picture behind this it

60
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,039
was actually two people in a hotel room

61
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,640
purifying dna in holland

62
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,920
because in 2010 we didn't need a

63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,920
football field full of robotics you

64
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,680
could actually purify dna from from a

65
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,359
species in a hotel room

66
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,840
and get and get it to get to its genome

67
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,478
just by moving that dna to a sequencer

68
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,680
now in the process of doing that a few

69
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,200
years later we've been able to

70
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
actually throw some of these robotics at

71
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,759
the problem and ryan lynch is going to

72
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,759
be showing where these uh where these

73
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,519
robotics actually lead to

74
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,959
i think i've got it going right there

75
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
some of you saw the tour yesterday so

76
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,200
this thing is

77
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,879
basically running around sequencing

78
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,560
dozens of cannabis genomes to get us a

79
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,479
better phylogenetic tree

80
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,000
and there's a good reason for this uh

81
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,439
but a lot of this

82
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,719
effort is actually to drive it and

83
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,318
understand the genetics that drive

84
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,039
cannabinoid expression and terpene

85
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,479
expression

86
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,280
and perhaps a lot of other traits

87
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,878
perhaps flowering rates and oil and

88
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
how quickly these plants might grow we

89
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,159
can perhaps tag those things to genetic

90
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,560
variants and track them

91
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,000
um and we've particularly excited about

92
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,878
the changes that have happened since

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,479
2000 uh

94
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,560
even the year 2000 the human genome

95
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,000
closed the cannabis genome is not nearly

96
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,439
in as good shape as the human genome we

97
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
have the human genome probably down to

98
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,719
only 100 gaps right now and

99
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,159
the cannabis genome is far harder to

100
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,000
sequence it's probably the hardest

101
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,519
genome we've ever sequenced it's about a

102
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,080
billion bases in size

103
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,439
it's 65 80 which is a nightmare to

104
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,400
sequence just from a chemistry

105
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,239
standpoint

106
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
and on top of that it differs by about

107
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,519
100 bases whereas humans differ about

108
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,120
one in a thousand so

109
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,560
this is the equivalent of having chimps

110
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
being able to mate with humans and still

111
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,519
have

112
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,519
productive offspring so this is a real

113
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,000
challenge to sequence and only recently

114
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,680
have new

115
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,598
sequencing tools emerge to help us on

116
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,200
this now one thing we did learn from the

117
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,000
first time we sequenced this genome was

118
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,919
that the thc

119
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,199
synthase region of the genome was at 8x

120
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,000
higher coverage than the rest of the

121
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,759
genome

122
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
that stood out to us as perhaps being a

123
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,000
gene replication event that was

124
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,239
responsible

125
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,158
for secondary metabolite expression and

126
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,319
maybe was also responsible for

127
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,079
bringing us more thc synthase throughout

128
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,679
the selection and prohibition

129
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,200
all right but at the time we actually

130
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
couldn't properly sequence this because

131
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,719
we only had 700 base pair reads and the

132
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,359
gene was about sixteen hundred bases

133
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,519
long

134
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
and we needed to know the perfect phase

135
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,560
of this gene which meant we needed to

136
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,080
know which variants were resting on the

137
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
maternal chromosome and which were on

138
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,000
the paternal chromosome there's two

139
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
copies

140
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,080
of every chromosome in this plant and if

141
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
you don't know that and the gene happens

142
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
to have lots of variation in it it can

143
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,039
be very difficult to call the amino acid

144
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
sequence that's resulting from these

145
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,280
genes

146
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,560
so we knew there was gene expansions we

147
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,080
didn't know what they coded for and

148
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,438
there was naturally a question did these

149
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
other genes code for these other

150
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,079
cannabinoids

151
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,119
because we really only see two genes in

152
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,359
the genome that can code for

153
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,560
cannabinoids cbd synthase and thc

154
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,159
synthase

155
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
fast forward to today and we now have

156
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,320
these single molecule sequencers which

157
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,918
can luckily sequence 40 000 bases at a

158
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,680
time it's a real breakthrough

159
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,959
the challenge is they only have 85

160
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,720
accuracy so to

161
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,719
uh to get the accuracy to a place where

162
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
we want it to be uh we can play some

163
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,240
tricks with 40 000 base pair

164
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,560
read lengths is we can actually clone

165
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,360
this dna with some hair pins

166
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,000
and they call them smart bells and this

167
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,240
thing can then

168
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
run around like a hamster on a wheel and

169
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,040
sequence this thing around and around

170
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
and around like a circle

171
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,400
and give us a error corrected sequence

172
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
this is what we call a

173
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,159
circular consensus sequence and it does

174
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,680
this with these zero mode waveguides if

175
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
those of you familiar with microwaves

176
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
you may

177
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,959
see a screen in front of that microwave

178
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,039
that is to basically make sure the

179
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,918
radiation which has a larger wavelength

180
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,439
than the

181
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,198
diameter of the whole of that screen

182
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,600
doesn't emanate through it but what it

183
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,319
does do is it leaves a little finite

184
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,639
zeptolita volume of a radiation of that

185
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,240
wavelength at a pin point in the hole

186
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
and that pinpoint is so small that a

187
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,439
single polymerase can fit there

188
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,919
and we can watch that single polymerase

189
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,439
incorporate dna signals in real time

190
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,879
now just due to the nature of loading

191
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,079
these things about a third of them only

192
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,519
get loaded with a polymerase

193
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,599
i can read but nevertheless there's

194
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,240
millions of these holes we can read

195
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
basically the the thc synthase sequence

196
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
of dozens of cultivars to go

197
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,160
and as long as we run it around 20 or so

198
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,478
times we get the accuracy up to a point

199
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,960
where

200
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,800
it is acceptable to to understand the

201
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,239
amino acid sequence of all these things

202
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,240
so when we've done this on a many drug

203
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,960
type cultivars what we find is there's

204
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,199
actually

205
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,959
a lot of copies of thc synthase and now

206
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,478
we know the amino acid sequence of them

207
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,000
and we can determine which ones are

208
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,599
active and inactive and which ones are

209
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
still question marks

210
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,479
there are a lot of inactive copies that

211
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,759
are getting replicated these have frame

212
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,719
shift mutations and they probably don't

213
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,919
code for anything

214
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,600
there's a handful of other ones that

215
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,120
have single amino acid changes that

216
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
might have a different efficiency of

217
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,759
folding

218
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,359
the precursors or they may actually have

219
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,360
other side products that might

220
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,360
result in these other cannabinoids folks

221
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,560
have seen but lo and behold we still

222
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,560
only see two major dna or i'm sorry

223
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,759
synthase like compounds and some of

224
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
their relatives which

225
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,120
we could argue maybe can account for

226
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,080
about 10 of the cannabinoids and their

227
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
derivatives

228
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,439
but we can't explain where all the other

229
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,318
ones are coming from with just this

230
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,360
alone

231
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
unless the side product thing is real

232
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,639
now the other literature that's out

233
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
there are that that microbiomes

234
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,840
potentially transform these things by

235
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
hydroxylating different parts of the

236
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,279
side chain and maybe even

237
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,719
dr machulan was recommending that they

238
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,000
might hydroxylate some parts of the

239
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,199
terpene precursors

240
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,839
that would change the way that these

241
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,759
things fold albeit most of these papers

242
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,119
suggest it's at very very low rates and

243
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,720
yields that this occurs and that they

244
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,918
can't get enough of the material

245
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,840
to do any type of clinical study with it

246
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,359
nevertheless this is very different than

247
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,279
what we see in the terpene synthase

248
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,280
pathway the terpene synthase pathway in

249
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,279
plants looks a lot like a plant or

250
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,799
vertebrate gene it has lots of introns

251
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,239
and exons and we get all types of

252
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,919
alternate splicing

253
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
and it's perhaps this alternate splicing

254
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,839
that might in fact be governing

255
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,960
the diversity that we see in terpene

256
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,038
expression

257
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,000
so where did thc synthase come from this

258
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,759
is a very important

259
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,598
question there's a berberine bridge

260
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,639
domain in this in this gene

261
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,000
that we see in poppy which folds opiates

262
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,079
and we also see it up and down the

263
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,160
angiosperm line then there's some very

264
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,560
weak homology to bacteria and fungi as

265
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,400
well

266
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
and it kind of looks like a microbial

267
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,000
gene it has a start and stop and it's a

268
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,120
single exon

269
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,478
which is very interesting to us

270
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,399
considering some of the work that dr

271
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,719
mitchell has published on quorum sensing

272
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,560
with these compounds and that they in

273
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
fact might be antimicrobial

274
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,079
so these compounds look as if they are

275
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,199
communication vehicles to the microbiome

276
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,038
that might sit on the plant and that

277
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,560
could be very important to us

278
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,159
when we're trying to understand this

279
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,598
level of complexity of terpene

280
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,520
expression that can occur with these

281
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,439
multi-exon genes

282
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,120
i think we can understand a few genes

283
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,719
could do this if they had all types of

284
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,319
alternate spicing it's harder for us to

285
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,759
imagine 100 cannabinoids coming from

286
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,960
just two genes

287
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,960
with the diversity that's in there but

288
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,680
maybe that's what's in fact happening

289
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,159
so we need to know the the microbiome

290
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,918
then

291
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,599
of these plants and we set out to do is

292
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,038
design a test that could be used in many

293
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,878
of the states that are doing

294
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,478
uh mold testing and bacteria testing

295
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
we're mandating mold and bacteria

296
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,199
testing in almost every state that

297
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,719
cannabis gets legalized in

298
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,319
however the techniques that we're using

299
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,840
to measure this stuff do not really

300
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,598
identify what bugs they are they just

301
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,318
count colonies and it's about 100 year

302
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,080
old technology known as a petri dish

303
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,839
now culture is a very interesting thing

304
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,759
getting things to culture has maybe only

305
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,000
70 percent or less

306
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,278
of the microbes are culturable some

307
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
argue it's maybe even

308
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,278
lower than that and on top of that it's

309
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,320
not very specific carbon sources don't

310
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:45,360
give you the type of information that

311
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
dna does so

312
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,120
we designed a test that actually

313
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,120
operates off of the its region of the

314
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
genomes this is the part of the genomes

315
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,480
that put you on the tree of life so

316
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,559
they're highly conserved regions in the

317
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,879
ribosomal dna operons that you can land

318
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,919
primers on to specifically amplify

319
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,320
one of these one of these genre and

320
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,079
in doing so there's information inside

321
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
of here that if you were to sequence it

322
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,879
would give you

323
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,480
high specificity in exactly what genre

324
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,720
and species you're dealing with

325
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
so we designed pcr assays that target

326
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,680
this region and give us quantitative

327
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,360
information as to how much microbial

328
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,799
content is present on the plant

329
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
and once we have that if there's any

330
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,679
questions of one that happens to be very

331
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
high in signal

332
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,000
we can then go and acquire what it is

333
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,039
and we do that by sequencing these pcr

334
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,919
products and it gives us a little

335
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,679
microbiome

336
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,360
idea of what's going on in these plants

337
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,799
so now we have a nice picture

338
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,800
of all the bugs that might be on

339
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,759
cannabis plants and we can go through

340
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,240
and itemize them

341
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,039
and ask okay we see some aspergillus we

342
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,959
see some

343
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,559
some fusarium and some botrytis but you

344
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,399
know here's one girl scout cookie that

345
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,838
has a tremendous diversity and a long

346
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,120
tail of different microbes

347
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,720
and the other ones that are these ones

348
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
are a little bit older samples and they

349
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,959
they seem to not be dominated by just a

350
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,360
couple

351
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,199
a couple microbes a couple of them stood

352
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,120
out however because these ones we were

353
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,240
not finding on anyone's radar in terms

354
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,320
of being a problem

355
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
in healthcare or on the plants these are

356
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,120
penicillium species

357
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,560
and they don't grow very well in

358
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
traditional culture systems they need

359
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,518
different temperatures and longer time

360
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
for these things to emerge

361
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,440
lo and behold when we look at these

362
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,040
compounds and

363
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,959
i'm sorry these microbes and we try to

364
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,719
grow them we have a very difficult time

365
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,518
growing them in just a couple days these

366
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
are 3m

367
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,799
petri films that didn't grow them these

368
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,159
are biolumix cartridges didn't grow them

369
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,439
and these are used in mold things from

370
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,199
some plate that didn't grow them

371
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,640
we can readily see the dna this

372
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
naturally evokes questions whether the

373
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,759
bugs are alive or dead so we had to go

374
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,519
and confirm that we could in fact grow

375
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,200
these in the right conditions

376
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,560
and that if you ran the sequencing

377
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,160
before and after growth you could

378
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,518
actually see a shift in how these things

379
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,719
were growing over time

380
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,120
so that they are live we do know that

381
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
and they happen to produce these

382
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,320
interesting compounds

383
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,320
now whenever you do ita sequencing it's

384
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,160
standard to go back and confirm that

385
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,920
with a secondary assay that that it's

386
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,439
really species specific and you've got

387
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,439
the bug that you're thinking about

388
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
and so we targeted the paxilene gene

389
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,800
that actually makes paxolene in the

390
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
cytrinium gene that makes it

391
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,679
a whole genome sequence those genes

392
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,879
after we amplify them and prove that

393
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,639
they're in fact there

394
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,559
now what we don't know is how much

395
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,399
they're expressing but an important

396
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,759
point is these all look very lipophilic

397
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,039
and they will probably co-extract with

398
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,639
cbd

399
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,399
they also happen to be this one in

400
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,078
particular is a nanomolar drug

401
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,000
so a small percentage contaminant of

402
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:18,799
this can actually have a bigger impact

403
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
than cbd

404
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,399
alone because it's a potassium channel

405
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,360
blocker and it's been published to have

406
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,879
contraindications with cbd in mice

407
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,320
we have another one here citrinium or

408
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,159
this one actually is known for disease

409
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
called rye grass staggers and farms so

410
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,439
some cattle can eat rye and have some of

411
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,919
this penicillium on it and they'll

412
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,760
stagger around with some type of ataxia

413
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,360
this one is more of a nephrotoxic agent

414
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,078
that's actually involved

415
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,079
in a pathway that we know about from

416
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,399
roger pertue's lab in duncan ryan's

417
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,239
paper suggesting cbd actually targets

418
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,278
this region and the vdec 1 receptor in

419
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,879
the mitochondria

420
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:52,399
and so trinum seems to be playing some

421
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,519
role in there we don't really know

422
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,078
what role it is though so this set us on

423
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,919
a mission

424
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,278
with digipath to try to see if we could

425
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,479
detect whether the compounds are

426
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,600
actually there it's one thing to show

427
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
the genes there you've got to show that

428
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,320
it's actually expressing the compound

429
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,000
this can be very difficult in the

430
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,360
cannabis background so we started with

431
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
paxolene from sigma

432
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,039
and started spiking that into cannabis

433
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,120
matrixes to see if we can pick it up

434
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,879
and at first sight what we can see is

435
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,639
that we lose about five to ten fold

436
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,320
signal in trying to detect this

437
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,919
if we use the oulig method that was

438
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,959
described using an lcms

439
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,199
ms spectrum of this when we spike this

440
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,479
in we lose about five to 10x signals so

441
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320
we're still working on how to do this

442
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
with the samples that we detected a

443
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,519
in a few slides prior but we now have an

444
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,839
assay thanks to

445
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,879
thanks to sydney's group that can detect

446
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,320
this we just have to make sure we have

447
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,120
the sensitivity to pick up stuff that

448
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,480
might be uh

449
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,399
nanomolar in concern so just to

450
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,079
summarize some of this microbiome work

451
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,440
what we have here is we've seen that the

452
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,278
culture-based systems are

453
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,959
basically screening things on any number

454
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,159
of colonies now this is not a very

455
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,518
accurate system

456
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,360
and we're quite concerned about this

457
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,839
because we don't know what microbes are

458
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,120
in fact

459
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,880
there as as we mentioned before 99 of

460
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,600
the microbes in your body are commensal

461
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,120
symbiotic

462
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,639
and harmless and we don't want to screen

463
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,240
those out we really need to get specific

464
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,680
about the ones that are a problem

465
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,519
and target the ones that are actually

466
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,359
human health risk and not just

467
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
start screening out microbes that might

468
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,320
the plant might need

469
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,919
our fear in screening out microbes the

470
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,680
plant might need is very analogous

471
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,439
if you had to live on antibiotics you

472
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,199
might screen out microbiomes that you

473
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,000
need to survive and we may create an

474
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,680
enormous genetic

475
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,360
selection against certain genetics in

476
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,958
the plant that can't make it through

477
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,399
this very grotesque screen

478
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,078
so what we want to do is dial in and get

479
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,919
much more specific with the dna

480
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,278
and hopefully fail less material and

481
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,919
only point out the ones that have health

482
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,439
risks

483
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,799
now what we've seen to date is we can

484
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,320
already tell that most of the yeast and

485
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,000
mold assays out there

486
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,440
when we see colonies on them we grab

487
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,958
those we sequence them and what we tend

488
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639
to find are bacterias

489
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,719
bacteria that are native to humans and

490
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,600
are not harmful we see staph we see

491
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,240
pseudomonas

492
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,440
we see acne propion bacteria now there

493
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,039
are some pseudomonas we need to worry

494
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,680
about originosis and we have seen that

495
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,278
on occasion

496
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,719
on on some cannabis samples but

497
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,399
generally it's a ubiquitous form of

498
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,680
pseudomonas it's not a concern

499
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,679
likewise with with the acne samples so

500
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,039
we need to be aware of this there's the

501
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,958
flip side of this coin is that a lot of

502
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,838
bugs do not culture at all and we've had

503
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,119
samples that are

504
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,320
totally loaded with mold that you can

505
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,440
see with your own eyes and they don't

506
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
grow at all

507
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
dna certainly uh picks these things

508
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,959
right up okay so

509
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,000
this was published and thanks to some

510
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,359
people in the audience john

511
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,559
mcpartlin really deserves to be an

512
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,480
author on this paper because he gave us

513
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,159
such an incredibly constructive review

514
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,600
and i really like this mechanism of

515
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,719
publication because of that because the

516
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,519
reviewers really

517
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,399
actually do strengthen the paper but

518
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,759
this is a

519
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,440
paper where you can review a lot of this

520
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,759
work and see what we did to compare this

521
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,920
to

522
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,120
a variety of different culture systems

523
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,639
so i'm going to flip this over to human

524
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,078
genetics which is five and a half

525
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,440
percent of the human population are

526
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,039
going to develop a genetic disease at

527
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,600
some time in their life

528
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,078
and this is uh it could go as high as 60

529
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,920
over time

530
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,278
and so we want to understand those

531
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,198
genetics because if we're going to be

532
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,958
applying cannabinoids and perhaps some

533
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,719
mitochondrial transformed cannabinoids

534
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,039
onto humans we want to understand

535
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,639
the genetic diversity in the patients uh

536
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,838
that this might apply to

537
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,440
um so in doing this we primarily been

538
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
focusing on mitochondrial dysfunction

539
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,360
and we did this for a reason

540
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,039
it does have some inroads into the ecs

541
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,959
and the reason uh this is a very

542
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,078
productive place to start sequencing in

543
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,599
the human genome

544
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,078
is that most of healthcare is very

545
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,000
skeuomorphic in that it is designed

546
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,838
according to anatomy we have cardiology

547
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,278
we have nephrology we have neurology

548
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,199
these are all organ systems that we've

549
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,240
built healthcare silos around and

550
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,000
and when you're dealing with a

551
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,240
disfunction in the krebs cycle it is

552
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,839
very agnostic to which organ it is in

553
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,759
it can bounce between any of these and

554
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,959
that creates an enormous expense in the

555
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,560
healthcare system that likes to

556
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,919
specialize based on organs

557
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,838
so patients that have this type of

558
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,000
dysfunction can sometimes take six years

559
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,240
to get a diagnosis and an enormous

560
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,198
number of bills and of course this this

561
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,959
leads into

562
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,479
seizures because your brain is two

563
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,239
percent of your body weight but twenty

564
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
percent of your energy consumption so if

565
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,159
you have a mitochondrial dysfunction

566
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,838
it actually can find its way into pain

567
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,919
into gi issues into

568
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,120
seizure disorders and into asd and

569
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,719
developmental delay

570
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,078
so we've developed a lot of these panels

571
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,199
to target these different regions

572
00:15:58,078 --> 00:15:59,919
they're going to be spoken on a little

573
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,838
bit later

574
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,278
but i think the the really exciting work

575
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,160
that we're seeing and this is published

576
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,078
by bernard

577
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,000
a few years ago is that we are seeing a

578
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,799
lot of cb1 localization to the

579
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,278
mitochondria

580
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,879
in neural neural cells about 15 percent

581
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,480
of the cb1 receptors sit there so

582
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,240
there's definitely connections

583
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,680
and there's something going on there now

584
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,959
why do we want to know this genetic

585
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,399
information

586
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,679
we want to know this genetic information

587
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,039
because we're finding a continuing

588
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,879
growing list of genetic

589
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,799
contraindications or indications

590
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,879
particular genetic variants

591
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,240
okay so the sodium channel one mutation

592
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,919
is probably the most well-known in this

593
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,600
audience because this is one that that

594
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,360
signifies dravet syndrome

595
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,959
and although people in the past used to

596
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,959
avoid sodium channel blockers this might

597
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,198
be a signature to actually

598
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,198
move on or go directly to epidiolex or

599
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,039
cbd because this is these patients are

600
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,559
responding the best in those studies

601
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,319
we also love glucose transporter

602
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,319
variants that are indicative of a 90

603
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,839
response rate with a ketogenic diet so

604
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,680
if you have that variance you might as

605
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,160
well drive go right to a diet change and

606
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,000
that may

607
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,519
it may help with the patient there's

608
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,440
these polymerase gamma variants that you

609
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,959
want to avoid with vulpric acid if you

610
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,800
have this variant and you're given

611
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,000
depakote you can destroy your liver and

612
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,879
you end up with a 500

613
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,720
000 liver transplant all right this is a

614
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
very important thing to find out

615
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,000
and and you want to know about it before

616
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,079
you jump on to depakote

617
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,759
um there's other other indications with

618
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,359
gaba receptors and steripental and

619
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,640
calcium channels changing this but i

620
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,918
think the one that probably resonates

621
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,199
the most you may hear later is that

622
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,600
there's a vitamin

623
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,120
b6 form of epilepsy that if you have a

624
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,038
mutation in this gene you can treat the

625
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,318
patient with vitamin b6 and you get a

626
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:29,839
very good response right

627
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,279
and this is a form of epilepsy that if

628
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,959
you treated it with cbd you might

629
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:33,519
actually just mask the problem for six

630
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
months and

631
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,960
honeymoon out of it and realize you

632
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,400
should have had b6 six months ago

633
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,558
uh so that's one that's that's that's

634
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
that's it's on our radar quite a bit

635
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,359
so how do we go about doing this some of

636
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,440
you wanted the tour yesterday won't

637
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,279
spend much time on this uh we basically

638
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,200
have been sequencing panels and exomes

639
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,240
predominantly panels first in pediatrics

640
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
just due to the fact that when you

641
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,519
sequence whole exomes

642
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,798
you can uncover a great deal of

643
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,240
information about people that never

644
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,519
consented to being sequenced in other

645
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,919
words their relatives

646
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,918
when you find apoe variants or bracket

647
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,919
variants in these pediatric patients

648
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,600
that implies some other family members

649
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,919
may have some risk as well and so

650
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,119
acmg prefers that you you dial this into

651
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,960
panels first and expand

652
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,000
exomes later but the most important part

653
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,120
of the technique that we're running up

654
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,798
there

655
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,479
outside of the analysis that goes on is

656
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,240
in the laboratory it's a very condensed

657
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,880
laboratory because every patient that we

658
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,798
sequence

659
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,720
we hydroxy methylate their dna in the

660
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,400
active amplification so that dna is a

661
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,319
femoral and gets just self-destroyed in

662
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,679
the process of sequencing

663
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,279
and that's needed so that we never

664
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,038
contaminate someone else's dna with

665
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,079
another and it makes the lab footprint a

666
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:33,200
half the size

667
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,798
and it's been published in nature

668
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,759
biotechnology it has some implications

669
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,400
for it for um

670
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,759
uh gene patents as well um as i

671
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,840
mentioned earlier uh

672
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,679
this is uh the progression we tend to we

673
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,439
tend to start with is maybe 500 to a

674
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,880
thousand genes that will sequence we try

675
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,160
to dial this into just the genes that

676
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
are in the literature that we know are

677
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,000
connected to the particular phenotype

678
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,439
and uh if we don't find anything there

679
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,960
there's a possibility of expanding to

680
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,679
exomes and the difference between panels

681
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,279
and exomes

682
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,798
it's just besides the box that you order

683
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,798
these days

684
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,918
these things put out 250 gig in a shot

685
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:06,000
and these do about 10 gig in a shot

686
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,919
now inside this panel there happens to

687
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,319
be 39 uh different genes that we know

688
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,480
are really

689
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,599
tied into the ecs we have many of the

690
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,440
sodium channels

691
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,439
we have the v deck one uh receptor in

692
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,840
here you can see cenar one senior two

693
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,679
pha

694
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,519
maggle daggle mtor and a lot of these

695
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,400
other ones uh particularly the p450s

696
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,679
that are of importance

697
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
this is not all of them we think the

698
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,200
list is probably about 175

699
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,558
long but we're not sequencing those

700
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,240
other genes right now because it's tough

701
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,678
to find any clinical correlation with a

702
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,038
variant in those genes to it to an

703
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,600
actual human patient

704
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,400
i think in time that will change um so

705
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,399
when we do this

706
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,798
i want to touch just briefly i think i

707
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,080
have time on the p450 system here

708
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:44,160
um it is well known now that uh that cbd

709
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,839
is uh effectively like a grapefruit

710
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,759
juice warning on a drug

711
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,279
okay so it is a potent inhibitor of sip

712
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,720
3a4 and 2c19

713
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,160
which means if you have drugs that have

714
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,679
grapefruit juice warnings on them

715
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,279
grapefruit juice has bergamot in it and

716
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,559
that actually goes through except three

717
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,798
four and inhibits it

718
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,678
um cbd will slow down the metabolism of

719
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,079
other drugs

720
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,000
uh clobazam or onfi is one that was uh

721
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,199
seen in in the epidialex trial that this

722
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,119
can actually

723
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,880
escalate that in the blood and this is a

724
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,639
pro drug so when you when you change the

725
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,400
metabolism of a pro drug you're you're

726
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
slowing down the conversion of the drug

727
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,880
into the active form

728
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,200
and it can it can lead to some

729
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,520
complications same is true with cars

730
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,558
carbamezapine both of these drugs i

731
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,279
would caution just

732
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,558
to make sure that you have your hla 1502

733
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,519
variant sequence because they're both

734
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,200
known to actually trigger

735
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,679
stevens-johnson syndrome which can have

736
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,519
30 mortality rate if you're not careful

737
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,440
not very frequent in our population very

738
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,480
frequent in asian and in the pak rim

739
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,880
populations

740
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,759
uh so so p450s are important because to

741
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
know this

742
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
helps you understand how all of these

743
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,440
drugs are going to bounce around with

744
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,879
one another and most

745
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,038
patients with epilepsy are on three

746
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,799
drugs if not more

747
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,640
so what we do is we provide these tables

748
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,639
of drug drug interactions that if you're

749
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,000
on cbd what are the other drugs are

750
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,159
going to go up and down in the blood

751
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,759
according to the known literature

752
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,360
and of course which variants are

753
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,038
involved in the metabolism of these

754
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,399
whether they're fast metabolizers or

755
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,240
slow metabolizers

756
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,640
and this may help guide treatment

757
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
optimization uh of course we also

758
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
sequence the entire gene

759
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,200
and that's important not just nailing

760
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,119
these snips but when you sequence the

761
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,720
entire gene you might find frame shift

762
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,879
mutations in that gene

763
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,200
that are going to basically reverse the

764
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,960
if this is a fast metabolizer genotype

765
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,319
it's not a fast metabolizer if there's

766
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,000
actually a frame shift next to these

767
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,759
snips and so that can be important

768
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,880
information to capture with whole genome

769
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,240
sequencing

770
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,960
and we do see that stuff on on the

771
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
panels okay so i'm just going to wrap up

772
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,759
with what you can do when you

773
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,359
get to a pace of doing about a thousand

774
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,240
patients a month like we're doing up in

775
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,000
woburn

776
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,440
is that serendipity will have it that

777
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,839
you'll sequence some patients that are

778
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,759
actually

779
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,879
in current clinical trials and so we

780
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,960
tried to organize this a little bit

781
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,640
better than serendipitous serendipity

782
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
and we called up warren davinski and we

783
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,919
called up eric marsh and a few others

784
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,519
and said hey can we sequence the

785
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,919
patients in your study

786
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,679
hopefully to get to a common

787
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,960
polymorphism that might predict response

788
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,320
there's been great success with

789
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,240
epidialics out there

790
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,359
but there is a small subset of patients

791
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,038
that get worse

792
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,719
and when they get worse in epilepsy they

793
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,200
can be intubated you can end up in the

794
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,279
er

795
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,720
you can end up with status epilepticus

796
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,038
this can be very expensive and so we

797
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,798
want to see if we can dial that in

798
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,359
and what we have found to date is only

799
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:16,079
55 patients have been sequenced to date

800
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,918
and with those 55 patients we're

801
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,519
starting to see some signals although i

802
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,360
will caution you and david goldstein

803
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,798
would chime in here saying anything

804
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,479
to 10 to the minus 4th could be a

805
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,519
synthetic association and you need more

806
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,839
patience

807
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,038
but nevertheless the the snips that are

808
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,279
coming out of this

809
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,158
are implicating a handful of genes that

810
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,558
may have

811
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,159
a predictive value on the response to

812
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,000
cbd

813
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,320
now what's interesting is the ones in

814
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,079
yellow up here have some published links

815
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,839
to anandamide and that is actually

816
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,879
enriched next to any everything else

817
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,399
that's in the panel

818
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,000
that we that the genes that are falling

819
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,320
in as the top values here

820
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,159
actually have published links so that's

821
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,480
very interesting but we need to do more

822
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,360
and we just uh started on this doing

823
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,480
more with

824
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,719
um mgh we have an irb study approved to

825
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,480
sequence 55 more patients and mgh

826
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,839
interested in elizabeth thiel and david

827
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,599
friedman down at nyu

828
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,839
have been doing some work showing this

829
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,399
endes metal club exam escalation with

830
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,558
cbd

831
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,600
is real and traceable in the blood we

832
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,279
don't yet know if it's

833
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,319
if it's correlated with those genotypes

834
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:16,480
and that's what we're going to get at by

835
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,079
sequencing these other 55 patients

836
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,440
there's also another 50 patients that

837
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,879
we're bringing into the irb from

838
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,600
university of alabama birmingham i

839
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,080
believe some of them are here in the

840
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,319
audience

841
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,240
thank you for for joining us uh and we

842
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,918
have an irb that's also grant approved

843
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,440
uh now from chop they just received

844
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,480
another grant to sequence 50 more

845
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,400
patients so in the end we'll have

846
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,000
another 155 patients

847
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
hopefully that will be enough patients

848
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,798
to decide whether this is real or

849
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,319
synthetic

850
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,000
and we may have a marker that can help

851
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,200
predict cannabinoid response and maybe

852
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,119
teach us a little bit about

853
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,720
what's going on with with the esoteric

854
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,038
nature of cbd

855
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,480
now to do this correctly you need a team

856
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,079
of genetic counselors and there's

857
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,519
something on the x chromosome about

858
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,519
genetic counselors

859
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,639
um i don't know what it is yet that's

860
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,038
going to require a bit

861
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,480
a bigger study um but all of the without

862
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:59,278
these people we would never get any of

863
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,278
this done

864
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,480
it's a tremendous team up there that has

865
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,240
a real

866
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,679
interest in personalized medicine and

867
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,798
there's a lot of external people as well

868
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,159
they've been helping us on this

869
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,639
including internal people

870
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
uh i want to have um some call-outs to

871
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,320
digipath and cindy orsner she developed

872
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,678
that lcm sms technique

873
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,119
um now there's going to be some

874
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,080
presentations a little bit later from

875
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,278
ryan lynch

876
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,199
talking about the work we're doing with

877
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,240
the list exchange and genotyping a lot

878
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,519
of these plants to get a better

879
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
understanding of the drift and the

880
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,158
plants

881
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,440
and of course uh i want to call out doug

882
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
smith who's been doing a lot of the work

883
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,919
on the gw

884
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,600
study with oran eric marsh and and

885
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,600
russell senato uh

886
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,798
peter doherty with uh with roberto who's

887
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,519
been doing work on getting this to the

888
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:37,759
market

889
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,679
uh jessica avon and wendell and lay

890
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,119
they're all here doing work on various

891
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,400
aspects of exome sequencing and

892
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,079
microbial genetics

893
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,000
christina and adrian adrian did a lot of

894
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,439
work on cbd synthase and single molecule

895
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,119
sequencing with us over the summer

896
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,600
christina's been helping on exomes as

897
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,678
well

898
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,199
uh ben john and viscio as well have all

899
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,840
chipped in and likewise some of our

900
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,159
friends at

901
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,839
sc labs have helped us getting very

902
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,120
interesting genetics to sequence so with

903
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,839
that i will leave it for

904
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,839
questions

905
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:05,750
[Music]

906
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,960
we have time for just a couple questions

907
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,240
and we'll break for coffee but if

908
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,319
we could take a couple questions for

909
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,679
kevin if there any please

910
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,439
let's go ahead he will be available at

911
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,440
the coffee break as well to answer

912
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,480
uh and answer any questions you might

913
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,880
have

914
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,720
any questions john sir over here that

915
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,559
was a great presentation kevin

916
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,240
um speaking to the mic a little bit more

917
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,399
i will speak into the microphone

918
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,400
there we go okay so thank you michael so

919
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,558
with the interaction of the microbiome

920
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,759
and its potential

921
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,480
pathogenic nature in some cases

922
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:47,200
do you anticipate remediation or

923
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,278
sculpting or remodeling of a microbiome

924
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,000
for a particular cultivar

925
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,839
so that's a very good question um it's

926
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,880
early days and and we're hoping it may

927
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,519
help in just uh

928
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,039
perhaps bio moniting in in growth rooms

929
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,639
and to understand if anyone has

930
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,319
particular infections or blights that

931
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,278
this will be a helpful tool just to

932
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,200
understand

933
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,038
um understand that domain there is

934
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,880
definitely literature on using

935
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,079
bacillus to knock out botrytis and

936
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,320
bacillus is harmless

937
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,918
and uh and that's um that's interesting

938
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,200
to us i mean i think it's an important

939
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,640
point because when you look at food

940
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,120
we take these tests and we go into the

941
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,720
supermarket and start testing cheese

942
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,158
yeah you get a lot of cfu's some cheese

943
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,400
but it's not it's not harmful to you you

944
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,559
know

945
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,519
it's basically one big ball of microbes

946
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,759
um and so

947
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,278
uh i think we have to be rethinking the

948
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,879
the colony forming system because it's

949
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,720
not giving us information with any

950
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,039
specificity about what to do

951
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,000
if you have high cfus but i think it's

952
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,240
still early

953
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,038
as to doing what you suggest i'm hopeful

954
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,038
we can figure that out

955
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,640
one more question sure hi fred

956
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:49,839
vogelstein at wired what's it cost

957
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,840
to have your genetic test so the genetic

958
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,119
testing costs can vary depending on

959
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,399
whether you're just doing the microbial

960
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,239
sequencing up into whole exome

961
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,120
sequencing but i would say the gamut can

962
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,159
spread from

963
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,839
some tests that are 500 up to like 15

964
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,600
000 depending on how many genes you're

965
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:04,319
sequencing these are insurance

966
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,798
reimbursed

967
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,319
usually uh and so you know with that

968
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,319
there's some limits on how much

969
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,119
i can never get back to the patient due

970
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:21,839
to out-of-pocket expenses

971
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:21,839
thank you okay thank you

972
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,319
you
