1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,040
we have got one over here on the left

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,919
hi i'm kirsten i'm here again everybody

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,000
uh

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,519
i would like you guys to give us just

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,199
your overview

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,320
not so much about aea 2ag

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,640
or the phytocannabinoids but about

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,800
upregulation

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,960
of cb1 cb2 and possibly even

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,640
trpv-1 so if there's a

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,120
method or an analysis of those receptors

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
or maybe people just don't upregulate

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,439
there might be

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,759
something that you guys have to say

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:41,119
about that thank you

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,960
well i i just briefly touched on a study

17
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,159
from a couple months ago that was using

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
pet scans

19
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,479
to look at cb1 receptor densities and

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,198
people that had tolerance to

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,159
thc-based cannabis and they found that

22
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,238
after two days of

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,279
abstinence those receptors came back to

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,320
normal level

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,399
so we know that cb1 agonists can down

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,759
regulate the cb1 receptors and we know

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,600
that taking a break from those

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,599
agonists can upregulate it there's

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,400
probably other ways to upregulate it as

30
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,719
well which are

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
covered in dr mcpartlin's paper that

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,319
ethan

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,840
just mentioned right i'd add something

34
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,519
else i think that

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
heretofore there's been too much

36
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,840
concentration on thc

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,159
if he asked me what drug would

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
upregulate the system over time it would

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,439
be cannabidiol

40
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,758
and when used chronically it does seem

41
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:33,679
to increase the gain of the system and

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,959
help with uh so many aspects of this

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,560
beyond that and again from john's paper

44
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,679
uh you have aerobic activity

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,519
seems to upregulate the system

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,880
there's good evidence that the runner's

47
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:52,640
high is a an endocannabinoid mechanism

48
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,078
rather than related to endogenous

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,439
opioids and then

50
00:01:54,078 --> 00:02:00,000
finally the prebiotic probiotics

51
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,118
may figure into this in a big way they

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,478
seem to produce some

53
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:07,599
many of the same benefits on illnesses

54
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,840
that cannabidiol for example thank you

55
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,840
very much

56
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,598
i was wondering if i use cannabis

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,878
topically for pain and i was wondering

58
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,119
if you have ever

59
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,199
administered it or had somebody use it

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
for skin cancer

61
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,719
for what skin cancer

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,319
yeah there have been many many

63
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,639
attestations on

64
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:37,359
the web of curing or eliminating

65
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,279
skin lesions including cancers with

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
cannabinoids this really

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,560
uh what's amusing to me is that this

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,719
isn't new

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,039
this has been reported for hundreds of

70
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,800
years in other cultures it's just that

71
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,959
we forget history and because they

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
didn't have double blind controlled

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,239
studies then

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
nobody pays any attention to them

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,599
currently

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,000
but yeah you know it's clear that

77
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,759
many of the phytocannabinoids not just

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,800
thc and cbd

79
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,878
have this ability to kill cancer cells

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,439
in high concentrations while being

81
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:15,120
preservative for normal cells

82
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:17,039
so a great deal more work in a palatable

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
form in other words the double-blind

84
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,239
controlled studies

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
need to be done so that the rest of the

86
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,560
medical community will accept these

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,560
results

88
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,158
hi jeff block university of miami a

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,840
question

90
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:34,798
probably for dr sulak the two

91
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,239
abstinence considering perhaps a longer

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,120
time for chronic

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,640
down regulated patients any chair and

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,920
can you share with us how you rate the

95
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,958
two days and

96
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,839
if in fact you may miss a full healthy

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,039
retrieval of a naive system to work from

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,920
sure i i don't think that any program is

99
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,919
going to be

100
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,158
the optimal program for everyone but

101
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,839
based on the work i was doing about five

102
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,519
years ago when i was asking people to

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
take different lengths of abstinent

104
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,080
breaks

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,599
it seemed to me that most people did

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,000
really well with two days

107
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,839
in the six day program that i developed

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,239
the three days after the two days of

109
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,959
abstinence involved very low doses

110
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
of thc so it's almost abstinent but

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,720
we're just very gradually

112
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,159
reintroducing it and i'm i'm not sure

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,519
that that's the best method it's just

114
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,000
the best one that i've found

115
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,160
and it seems to work for most people any

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
comments on starting off with a

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,840
full compliment all of the knight of

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,680
study after four weeks of abstinence

119
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,000
i'm sorry could you repeat the question

120
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,639
any benefit to starting off with a

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,199
full complement of receptors all i would

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,079
after a longer abstinence break i'm not

123
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,160
sure i

124
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,758
think some patients they might need

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,120
longer than two days but i doubt

126
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,120
many would need a full month

127
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,040
hi this is guillermo moreno from the

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,520
university of california irvine

129
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,319
i was i first described the peripheral

130
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,680
restricted fine cubed or european 937 uh

131
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,639
which has to be improved to

132
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,478
be effective in a model of migraine and

133
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,600
also be an effective uh

134
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:12,159
painkiller and that got me interested on

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,919
the the possibility of activating

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,000
peripheral cv1 receptors

137
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,918
as opposed at both central and

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,600
peripheral

139
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:24,159
the research on thc a that dr zulek has

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,840
presented got me thinking after an

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,720
interaction with a patient with breast

142
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,679
cancer

143
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,880
if you believe that the presence of the

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,840
carboxylic acid

145
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,399
in thca might prevent it for accessing

146
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,918
the uh

147
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,399
the brain that would be one of my

148
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,038
hypotheses and then the fact that it is

149
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,198
effective

150
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,360
is something that we were discussing uh

151
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,600
with dr gosling too

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,639
will it be possible in a case of

153
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,400
epilepsy

154
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,360
that a peripheral cb1 agonist will help

155
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,799
with the seizure but not with the uh

156
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,840
with the central

157
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
spike if that makes sense you know able

158
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,599
to control the

159
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,280
the motor uh component of the seizure

160
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,960
without controlling the central

161
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,839
if you think something like that will be

162
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,839
possible thanks

163
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,120
those are some interesting ideas i you

164
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,360
know i think that um from my experience

165
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,759
pretty clearly uh thca

166
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
does penetrate uh the central nervous

167
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,160
system

168
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,599
um you know based on on some of those

169
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,520
studies that i presented

170
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,879
and i think that the peripheral activity

171
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,918
of thc

172
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,719
uh as a anti-spasmodic wouldn't be

173
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,439
potent enough to really i mean it might

174
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
reduce the

175
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,519
intensity but i doubt that it would

176
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,240
reduce the observable effects of the

177
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,959
seizure

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
altogether i'd like also to add to that

179
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,439
i'm not sure why

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,720
you just want to stop the motor activity

181
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,160
of the seizures because if the brain

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,840
activity is still going on that

183
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,439
can still continue to cause damage

184
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,198
right we were we were questioning

185
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,038
whether or not we were seeing just

186
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,520
non-convulsive seizures when we give

187
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,159
thca was it calming down the

188
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,839
manifest the motor manifestation but

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,080
possibly if we hook somebody up to an

190
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:07,119
eeg we'd still be seeing some

191
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,240
uh seizure activity and brain waves

192
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,079
and that would be an interesting

193
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,840
question to look at uh and that's one of

194
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,359
the things i do with all my cbd patients

195
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,839
that i have an epilepsy i monitor their

196
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,840
eg's very closely and very frequently

197
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
no in florida where i was practicing

198
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,759
unfortunately we weren't allowed to use

199
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
thca so i didn't have any experience

200
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,319
with that

201
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,520
i'm not sure if dr guytanis is still

202
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,919
here but he has

203
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,399
looked at eegs of some of the thca

204
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,399
patients

205
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,680
i mean for it's mixed i've had some

206
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,079
patients where there's no

207
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
change in spike weight discharges in

208
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,279
terms of frequency

209
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,960
but uh and others where i've seen a

210
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,079
pretty dramatic proven spike rate

211
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,079
frequency

212
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,159
with the seizure question though the so

213
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,198
the question of like a non-convulsive

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,400
uh status without a pulse of seizure uh

215
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,639
we did have one of our

216
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,598
patients who was getting thc report

217
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,360
seizures

218
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,598
we actually had hooked up on eg at that

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
time and it was truly aborted seizure

220
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,000
there wasn't

221
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,758
an electric seizure with absence of

222
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
propulsions and that's what we see that

223
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
clinically because

224
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,079
the patients who've used thc to afford

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,800
seizures are alert after so it's pretty

226
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,000
that's the most

227
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,079
dramatic part is when they get uh

228
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,680
we're valued during the seizure usually

229
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,680
these rectal dies again

230
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,720
patients out of it for like five or six

231
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,720
hours

232
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
if they get thc to avoid a seizure

233
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,599
they're alert within you know 10 or 20

234
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,919
minutes

235
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,959
back to themselves pretty close to it a

236
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,120
little giggly but

237
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,718
you know it's really good so that's how

238
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:41,839
you know the seizures ended

239
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,839
i think there's no doubt that it's true

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,039
hi i'm pat fry i'm a private

241
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,159
practitioner

242
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,319
my question is regarding patients um

243
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,439
who are using cannabis for its

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,560
anti-tumor or anti-prolific activity

245
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
is it a lifelong commitment to cannabis

246
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,039
therapy

247
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,639
um or is is there any i know there's no

248
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,000
protocol for anything but

249
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,639
um what is the approach for patients who

250
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,039
are able to get go into remission and

251
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,919
then

252
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,719
the second part of my question is

253
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,838
regarding

254
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,839
pregnant and lactating women what your

255
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,880
i'd like to hear the panel's thoughts on

256
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,240
cannabis use

257
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:26,559
in that patient population well i i can

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,080
answer the question on the anti-tumor

259
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,599
it's it's a very good question because

260
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
it's something that patients come in and

261
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,759
ask is how long am i going to have to

262
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,200
take this it's expensive

263
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:40,559
sometimes the high doses of thc disrupts

264
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,040
your functional ability and so we don't

265
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,958
know

266
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,480
there's no clinical trials we we don't

267
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,239
know if somebody uh

268
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,560
there's anecdotal reports of people

269
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,159
taking high-dose cannabis oil for three

270
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,879
months

271
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,919
they report that their seizure sorry

272
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,399
cancer free

273
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,439
and then they go about their business

274
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,919
and it's

275
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,920
they're not taking high dose anymore but

276
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,360
one presumes that they might be taking

277
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,919
some

278
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
low-dose cannabis for other symptoms and

279
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,319
it's possible that that might be keeping

280
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,639
them

281
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:16,000
at a level of cancer freedom

282
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,399
many of my patients who have very

283
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,440
advanced cancers who get good results

284
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,480
are terrified to go off cannabis oil and

285
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,079
so many of them

286
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,200
will reduce the dose once they have

287
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:33,838
some success usually after six months

288
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,839
sometimes a year if they achieve

289
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,800
cancer free or in remission

290
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,719
and the reality is nobody really knows

291
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,479
how long to stay on it it would be very

292
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
interesting to start looking at these

293
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,440
patients

294
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,439
to see if is it can you stop right after

295
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,839
or is it five years like they talk about

296
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,240
in the

297
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,440
in the conventional treatment it's hard

298
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,879
to know

299
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
i have a few colleagues that have

300
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,278
treated patients with cancer including

301
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,958
on medical marijuana for a year or more

302
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,159
so and they've been taken off of it and

303
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,159
the cancers have recurred

304
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,360
okay we'll go with fred vogelstein over

305
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,360
there or sorry hans

306
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,399
you're just not gonna let that go are

307
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:20,159
you hey it's fred vogelstein at wired

308
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:24,078
for dr goldstein or any of you guys um

309
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:26,799
assuming that patients are taking say 25

310
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:30,319
to 1 cbd oil

311
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:33,919
at what dosages do you

312
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,000
ca what dosages can you administer

313
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,759
before you start to see thc effects

314
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,320
on some of the kids so for example like

315
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,480
2

316
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:48,399
at 25 to at 25 to 1 for example

317
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,360
a 250 milligrams a day would be 10

318
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,399
milligrams of thc

319
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,200
would that do patients tend to

320
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,120
see any kind of thc effects or do the

321
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
cbd effects tend to cancel those out how

322
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,959
does that work what's been your

323
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,800
experience

324
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,319
well i can talk to my experience and

325
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,679
then i'll let the other panelists talk

326
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,200
to theirs

327
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:11,599
i do find that children and there's

328
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
one report in the literature that says

329
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,360
that children may have

330
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,879
immature cannabinoid receptors so they

331
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,639
may not respond

332
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:23,120
i do find children tolerate thc much

333
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,039
better than adults

334
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,360
many of them do um i have not found

335
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,399
and you know people ask me how do you

336
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
know a child's

337
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,879
uh not high right and you know many

338
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,239
parents can tell

339
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:41,200
we had a problem in um or i should say

340
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,879
seven patients contact me not this uh

341
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,560
past summer the summer before right

342
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,439
around the same time

343
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,119
there was a product that was parents

344
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,079
were sharing information on the internet

345
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,120
about a particular 25 to 1

346
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,120
ratio cbd made from ac dc and the

347
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,879
company had shipped out just a new batch

348
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,799
to a handful of my patients

349
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,879
and on a friday i got a call from a mom

350
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,159
who said okay this batch is different my

351
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,240
kids acting weird

352
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,240
and i wasn't sure what to make of it and

353
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,919
then the next day i got two phone calls

354
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,320
we just got a new batch

355
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,919
people who did not know each other um my

356
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,399
kids on the floor giggling

357
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,078
and one parent says my kids hasn't

358
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,480
gotten out of the refrigerator

359
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,000
i mean there's a clear cut and then i

360
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,639
four out of the seven k

361
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,639
uh parents that reported this to me um

362
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,120
actually took the oil themselves and

363
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,879
reported that they were um that had

364
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,000
major psychoactivity

365
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,439
and so um it was clear-cut that these

366
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,039
people were able to recognize

367
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,279
psychoactivity i do not

368
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:42,000
hear that from my families that are

369
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,838
using the 25 to 1 even with very high

370
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,440
doses to 300

371
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,440
sometimes 450 milligrams that being said

372
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,199
i do find that many patients who are

373
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,079
able to be verbal about their

374
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,838
experience find that if you start at a

375
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,198
high dose

376
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,519
they have some difficulty so we start at

377
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,479
a lower dose and we titrate up i do that

378
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,440
anyway

379
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,079
but for some families who came to me

380
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,360
without

381
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:12,719
me starting them they started earlier

382
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,120
prior to my advice they said oh we're

383
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,480
told to start at 300 milligrams a day

384
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,159
and you know the kids

385
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,839
kind of wiped out from it so there may

386
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,198
be some tolerance issue there that you

387
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,639
know you start low and you're able to

388
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,639
build it up over time

389
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,919
yeah i'd echo that you always want to

390
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,519
start low

391
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:33,198
on use the dose that's effective um

392
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,919
with these high cbd low thc

393
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,519
i like my rule of thumb currently is to

394
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:41,439
try not to exceed

395
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,799
a total of 15 milligrams of thc a day

396
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,959
after titrating upwards

397
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,120
and generally well particularly for

398
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,559
adults it's very unlikely someone's

399
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
going to get into trouble with that

400
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,719
approach

401
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:59,359
but even with these broad ratios

402
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,600
thc tends to overwhelm the effects of

403
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,320
everything else if given the chance and

404
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,120
so

405
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,920
uh titration from a slow start is is

406
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,839
really necessary

407
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,000
i have a question uh have any of you

408
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,240
noticed a circadian rhythm

409
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,559
to endocannabinoid activity either with

410
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,519
respect to time of day of dosing

411
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,159
or increased pathology and shift workers

412
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,919
or

413
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,679
people with different sleep disturbances

414
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,679
well i couldn't relate to that but yeah

415
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,759
there's a lot of evidence to show there

416
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,958
is a circadian rhythm

417
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,679
to levels and um yeah that literature

418
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,679
exists

419
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,120
has has there been any experience in

420
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,838
time of day of dosing

421
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,959
is more effective well the thing to keep

422
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,320
in mind is

423
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:45,439
these don't last 24 hours um generally

424
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,600
speaking depending on the preparation

425
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,600
and the motive administration most

426
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,800
people are going to need to administer a

427
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,040
cannabinoid drug

428
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,000
two or three times a day if they're

429
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:58,000
inhaling it probably is a lot more

430
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
but for chronic illnesses there should

431
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,879
be an an emphasis

432
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,839
on some kind of either oral mucosal or

433
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,759
gi

434
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,839
administration and do you see more

435
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,120
pathology with deficiencies and shift

436
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,160
workers or anybody

437
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,399
who's i couldn't say for sure it's

438
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,719
worth studying all right thank you get a

439
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,720
grant

440
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,799
this one's for uh dr selleck here you'll

441
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,159
have to excuse me the past few days have

442
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,519
been a little bit of a whirlwind and the

443
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,480
slides have gotten a little blurry

444
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,919
already

445
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,519
there was one slide that you had up

446
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,278
where you were talking about the

447
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,000
up and down regulation of cannabinoid

448
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:37,519
receptors in a 48 hour cessation

449
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,198
from thc would then up regulate

450
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,039
uh the cannabinoid receptors again but

451
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,240
then in the same slide there was one

452
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,278
showing that thc

453
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,639
actually causes the up regulation of of

454
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:48,720
cb1

455
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,560
is that dose dependent as well did you

456
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,278
notice or was that or

457
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,958
how does how does that work quite so i

458
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,919
think it's pretty well established that

459
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,359
enough thc or any cb1 agonist will down

460
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,719
regulate the receptors they're

461
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,079
internalized

462
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,480
and there's just a little bit of

463
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:07,198
evidence that a low dose or a single

464
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,360
dose of thc can upregulate

465
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,679
the expression of the receptors and also

466
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,759
the affinity of the receptors

467
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,720
thank you yes this question is for dr

468
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,480
goldstein

469
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,880
would you please comment on your

470
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,919
experience with adhd

471
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,520
sorry with what um

472
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,840
your experience with adhd and

473
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,000
any ratios that that you use on your

474
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:33,918
patients

475
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,919
uh well i always start with it's

476
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,840
personalized so different people respond

477
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,400
can have the same diagnosis and respond

478
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,839
differently

479
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,600
to different ratios i have

480
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,079
patients using 27 to 1 25 to one all the

481
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,038
way down

482
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,480
to one to one i do find that my adult

483
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,839
patients

484
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,679
with add or adhd when i very first

485
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,399
started practicing it was mostly people

486
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,320
who were smoking or vaporizing

487
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,559
thc and they found very good results um

488
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,399
and many of them there's two kinds of

489
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,480
patients that i see some that get

490
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,240
enhancement of activity that like we're

491
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,558
looking for if somebody gets

492
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,480
ritalin or adderall but without the side

493
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,599
effects and then i have another

494
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,120
like subset of population who do find

495
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,399
good results with the stimulant

496
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,159
medications

497
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,919
but they find that some of the side

498
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
effects are intolerable including you

499
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,280
know loss of appetite and poor

500
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,880
sleep so they're using cannabis in the

501
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,558
evening to counter out

502
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,720
the effects of a medication that

503
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,038
actually does work functionally for them

504
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,160
but at nighttime it they are feeling the

505
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,480
side effects

506
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,080
in my pediatric population i am starting

507
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,679
to see a lot of patients coming in

508
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,798
because parents are very concerned about

509
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,798
putting their children on these

510
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,119
medications

511
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,480
i always start with pediatric patients

512
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,319
with a high ratio cbd to low thc

513
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,839
sometimes there's other comorbid

514
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,279
comorbidity epilepsy

515
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,199
autism sometimes exists ocd sometimes

516
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,678
that i'm seeing and i just find that i

517
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,759
start with i always start at the

518
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,679
high cbd low thc so like 27 to 1 25 to 1

519
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,119
sometimes 21 depends on what the parents

520
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,080
can find and get

521
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,918
and then i slowly will depending on

522
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,759
results checking in frequently every

523
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,200
couple of weeks

524
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,679
maybe titrate in a little thc to see

525
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,279
what the effects are i have a little boy

526
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
right now that i'm taking care of that

527
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,279
came to see me with epilepsy he's he

528
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,600
at the time was four he's been my

529
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,798
patient now for two years

530
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,759
and he was having terrible rage uh with

531
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,599
kepra it was

532
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,599
impossible they couldn't go anywhere or

533
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,359
do anything the family came in tears to

534
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,918
me

535
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,359
we started him on cbd oil and he

536
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,799
responded beautifully

537
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:50,159
but what's interesting is that his

538
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:53,359
adhd and autism kind of

539
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
persisted no rage anymore but he was

540
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,479
really kind of a very

541
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,000
difficult child he couldn't be in a

542
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,038
preschool he couldn't uh

543
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,079
wasn't really learning and had no focus

544
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,798
and we started very low dose thc added

545
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,240
in

546
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:10,000
as a separate for more treatment of that

547
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,120
and it turns out he's on a one-to-one

548
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,759
ratio he takes

549
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,879
50 milligrams of cbd three times a day

550
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,879
for seizures

551
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,400
and he takes 50 milligrams in the

552
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,600
morning of thc which

553
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,960
is a very large dose

554
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:28,399
and is actually in

555
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,558
a classroom that's considered mild and

556
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,480
his focus he's learning to read and

557
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,879
write and

558
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,240
as the mom says i feel bad giving him

559
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,919
this but he's not high

560
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,279
you know he's going off to school and

561
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,280
i'm getting good reports and

562
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,038
nobody knows he's on thc because she's

563
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,038
worried about being reported

564
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,079
but meanwhile the child is having major

565
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:48,400
success

566
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,599
and so it really does depend on

567
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
individual but again

568
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,839
starting low and tip toeing up on dosing

569
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,359
and just really going by how the patient

570
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,720
responds is really the way to go with

571
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,319
cannabis

572
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,079
and i just wanted to add it's not a

573
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,839
direct answer to the question but

574
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,079
because this conference has focused a

575
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,639
lot

576
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,599
on cbd and especially in the treatment

577
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,919
of children

578
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,079
i have found clinically that thc is a

579
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,919
very safe and effective medicine

580
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,480
for children with self-injurious

581
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,799
behavior violent behavior chronic pain

582
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,038
with seizures with many different

583
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,200
conditions thc seems to have

584
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,079
a better side effect profile in children

585
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,720
than it does

586
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,240
with adults and it for for some of these

587
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,159
really sick kids it's something that

588
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
should not be ignored it might even be

589
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,799
a first line treatment option because of

590
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
better efficacy faster at lower doses

591
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,440
better cost effectiveness than cbd so i

592
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,759
think we've got time for one more

593
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,360
30-second question

594
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,720
to the whole panel two questions one

595
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,079
about uh the use

596
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,558
the efficacy and bioavailability from

597
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:51,279
nanoparticle

598
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,720
uh cannabis full spectrum not just cbd

599
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,200
and the second question is

600
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,240
what other kind of uh chemical can be

601
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,279
used

602
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,159
uh to expedite bioavailability

603
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,918
outside of nanotechnology i'll just

604
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,039
address the second part

605
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,159
um as we heard alluded to this morning

606
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,038
uh cannabinoids get invest with a lipid

607
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,120
carrier

608
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,279
so you'll see a lot of preparations in

609
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,399
sesame oil or coconut oil or

610
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:21,038
ghee is a really good one

611
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,559
additionally absorption is aided by

612
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,640
taking with food

613
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,879
as opposed to a lot of other medicines

614
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,960
particularly herbal agents

615
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,960
but that would be the advice there

616
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,558
all right if we can thank the the

617
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,599
panelists here this has been very

618
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:41,839
enlightening and

619
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:41,839
conducting discussion

620
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,399
you
