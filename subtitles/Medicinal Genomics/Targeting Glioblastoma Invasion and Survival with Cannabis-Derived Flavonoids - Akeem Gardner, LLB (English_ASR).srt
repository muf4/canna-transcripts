00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,559
hello everyone I'm very excited to be

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,660
here my name is Akeem Gardner I'm CEO of

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,820
Canada Inc and we are a pre-clinical

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,900
biotechnology company from Ontario

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,880
Canada

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,920
we specialize in looking at all the

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,839
prenilated flavonoids the still beans

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,880
and the benzos and the cannabis plant

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,920
and today I'm going to present to you

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,559
one of our research projects looking at

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,220
glioblastoma Invasion and survival with

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:31,979
cannabis derives with flavonoids

13
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,558
so can 5 and a and b are penelated five

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,539
enolates found in Cannabis sativa they

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,738
have the flavon backbone consisting of

16
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:43,200
two fennel rings and a heterocyclic ring

17
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,539
about 36 years ago Baron and all

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,760
identified these five flavonoids as

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,140
Inhibitors of the prostaglandin E2

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,939
production

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,280
and what she demonstrated was that they

22
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:56,039
had anti-inflammatory effects up to 30

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,899
times more potent than aspirin but with

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,760
a different mechanism of action one that

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,980
was presumably safer for us than our end

26
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,079
seeds

27
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,359
these molecules are highly lipophilic

28
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,978
and their this nature allows them to

29
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,900
easily accumulate into cells and

30
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:12,679
potentially interact with membrane-brown

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,118
enzymes and receptors

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,680
now recent Studies have explored the

33
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,180
potential of these molecules in cancer

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,939
research

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,400
one study found that can 5 and a induced

36
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,679
apoptosis and decreased Invasion and

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,920
bladder cancer cells

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,759
a 2019 study pre-clinical study found

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,799
that an isomer of can 5 and B cathlonome

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,200
increased apoptosis in pancreatic cells

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,439
in vitro and limited metastatic

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,719
progression in Vivo the FDA has recently

43
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,459
granted an IND to allow them to further

44
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,859
this work

45
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,959
however none of these studies proposed a

46
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,219
mechanism of action for how can violence

47
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,259
actually interfere with cancer

48
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,840
progression

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,000
earlier this year we had this study

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,100
published in phytomedicine plus and in

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,319
this study we took a look at how can

52
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,719
fibon's activity actually affected

53
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,478
cancer and what the target of this

54
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,560
activity might be track B and I'm going

55
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,399
to take you through a little bit about

56
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,399
what we found today

57
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,000
so first off our work started off by

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,219
looking at a protein called the activity

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,098
regulated psychoskeleton Associated

60
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,840
protein or Arc for short

61
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,759
think of art like a super smart

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,500
scientist in the brain it's really

63
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,620
important for helping our brains adapt

64
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,780
and learn new things our neuroplasticity

65
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,580
it plays a big role in how we think and

66
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,659
understand stuff the brain's cognitive

67
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,300
function

68
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,400
now art doesn't work alone it has a

69
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,500
friend the brain derived neurotrophic

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,599
factor or bdnf

71
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,818
and bdnf is like a messenger that

72
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,378
carries the instructions to Arc it's a

73
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,780
growth factor which means it helps

74
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:53,060
things grow and develop in our body

75
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,979
bdnf tells Arco sorry

76
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,199
now bdnf tells Arc to produce more of

77
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,299
his mRNA and protein sort of like

78
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,000
telling it to clone itself

79
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,800
how does bdnf send this message it does

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,080
so through activating a special type of

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,239
receptors called the tropomyosin kinase

82
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,760
B receptor track B

83
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,400
so you think of bdnf like a mailman

84
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,639
track B is the mailbox and Arc is the

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,760
scientist that reads the male

86
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,919
now back in 2017 researchers in our lab

87
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,318
identified a bunch of compounds that can

88
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,238
change how art gets produced and they

89
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:31,039
found these molecules by screening

90
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,039
through primary Mouse cortical neurons

91
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:36,439
among the identified compounds five

92
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:39,060
flavonoids enhanced Arc protein levels

93
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:41,400
dietzine and ginseng were two

94
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,979
isoflavones that increase our protein

95
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,080
levels as demonstrated by nuclear Arc

96
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,459
expression measured via fluorescent

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
immunostaving

98
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,959
so for us we wanted to know what can

99
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,759
five and Zach similar would they act the

100
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,860
same

101
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,199
so we adapted this previous experiment

102
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,019
this time focusing on the effects of can

103
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,939
5 and a and b on Art protein expression

104
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,759
using the same primary Mouse cortical

105
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,979
neurons and our hypothesis was was that

106
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,500
can fly and a and b might actually

107
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,119
increase the amount of Arc protein when

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,280
added to the neurons that were already

109
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,379
stimulated with an external source of

110
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,459
bdnf

111
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,779
now who however very surprisingly

112
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,720
instead of seeing the arc protein

113
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,459
increase as expected can flavins at

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,860
concentrations between 1 to 20

115
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:32,339
micromolar actually prevented the normal

116
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,780
increase in our protein caused by bdnf

117
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,478
this was observed through Western

118
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,339
blotting and by examining the protein

119
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,978
expression in the nucleus via

120
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,719
immunostaining so the results that we

121
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:45,860
found were actually quite different than

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,860
our initial expectation

123
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,040
so our team wanted to find out if Camp

124
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,319
atoms were causing the arc protein to

125
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,960
break down or if they were affecting how

126
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,180
the arc mRNA was being copied which is a

127
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,819
step before a protein is made

128
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,280
to do so they performed a experiment

129
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,399
called the quantitative polymerase Chain

130
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,379
Reaction or qcpr for sure

131
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,060
this is a fancy way of saying we were

132
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:11,939
copying and measuring the amount of Arc

133
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,040
mRNA and we used two molecular scissors

134
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:15,060
that targeted different parts of the arc

135
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,160
transcript

136
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,079
and doing this we discovered that camp

137
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,320
Islands at a specific concentration

138
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,740
about 10 micromolar stop the usual

139
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,659
increase of Arc mRNA expression

140
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,699
now putting this together with the

141
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,740
results from the early experiments the

142
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,259
scientists concluded that effects of

143
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,819
Camp vitamins happened after Trek B is

144
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:40,740
is activated by B by bdnf but before the

145
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,519
Machinery that controls Arc expression

146
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,519
gets switched on

147
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,240
so I'm going to use a little a bit of

148
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,939
analogy to talk a little bit more about

149
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,038
Trek B we're going to imagine track B

150
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,019
activation as relay race

151
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,959
bdnf is the runner at the start of the

152
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:00,839
line and track B receptor is the Baton

153
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,418
once the race starts bdn F binds to the

154
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,339
Trek B receptor similar to a runner

155
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,500
grabbing the Baton

156
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:10,560
this binding leads to the diametization

157
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,139
of two track B receptor Parts similar to

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,000
two hands holding of baton and once

159
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,340
these parts are together tyrosine

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,800
residues on The receptors which are like

161
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,439
the batons marking get flagged or

162
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,139
phosphorated this tagging recruits and

163
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,899
activates halter proteins such as Schick

164
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,000
or gerb II kind of like signaling the

165
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:32,519
next Runner to get ready

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,038
so what we wanted to see is what did the

167
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,019
can flavins influence this relay race we

168
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:41,339
focused on two important markings on the

169
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:43,799
Baton the y515 and y705

170
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,379
and once again using Western blot we see

171
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,560
that both can 5 and a and can 5 and B

172
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:51,478
like unexpected hurdles in a race slow

173
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,639
down the tagging of these baton markings

174
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,918
in a dose-dependent manner

175
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,019
this means the more Camp items we add

176
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,939
the less tagging happens which

177
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,219
ultimately prevents the activation of

178
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,879
the next runners or Downstream signaling

179
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,880
Cascades

180
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,319
let's continue with the race analogy so

181
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,239
after the Baton has been picked up and

182
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,580
the race is underway there are several

183
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,139
tracks that a runner can take these are

184
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:17,818
like the simulink pathways that are

185
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:22,259
controlled by Trek B

186
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:25,439
specifically you have map key Act mtor

187
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,120
and the s6k pathways you can think of

188
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,740
these Pathways like the different Lanes

189
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,660
in a relay race

190
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,300
so what we decided to do was look at how

191
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,580
can 5 and a and b can impact these lanes

192
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,340
and using Western blotting we found that

193
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,620
camp violence A and B significantly slow

194
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:43,079
down the runners in these Lanes

195
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,319
they reduced the bdnf induced increase

196
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:49,038
in map k

197
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,039
Act

198
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,500
and the s6k pathways

199
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,780
so in our race analogy if bdnf is the

200
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,060
starting pistol it usually makes these

201
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,579
runners or Pathways speed up but with

202
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,439
Cam Flav and Zane B it's as if they're

203
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,120
running on a track filled with obstacles

204
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,978
slowing them down

205
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,780
what's more is that we notice that the

206
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:11,519
changes in speed across these Lanes

207
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,519
happened independently of each other

208
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,500
with limited interactions and this

209
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,899
suggests that can flavins likely set up

210
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,879
their obstacles very early on in the

211
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,818
race right at the start of track B

212
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,099
signal activation

213
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,439
so what does all this mean for cancer

214
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:30,538
research

215
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,458
well track B is a little bit of a

216
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:35,639
troublemaker in many types of cancers

217
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,439
this includes breast liver lung and very

218
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,620
severe type of cancer of brain cancer

219
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,760
called the bleobustimo multiform GBM for

220
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,979
short

221
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,439
GBM is the worst kind of brain cancer

222
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,060
it's top level it can show up anywhere

223
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,640
within the command center of our body

224
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:53,518
our central nervous system

225
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,278
GBM has the ability to grow rapidly with

226
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,620
proliferation it can invade nearby cells

227
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,080
Invasion and it could also send this

228
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,879
henchmen to other areas of the body with

229
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,000
metastasis

230
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:09,179
and guess who's giving GBM these powers

231
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,820
yep it's our problematic friend Trent B

232
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,679
sorry it was supposed to be here

233
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,379
because of its effects in the human body

234
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,259
we often lose the war against GBM with

235
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:21,899
survival rates less than two years

236
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,600
right the current weapons that we have

237
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:27,539
against GBM like surgery chemotherapy

238
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,759
and radiation can help us fight battles

239
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:33,059
for a while but things often end up in

240
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,399
relapse and GBM taking control and this

241
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:37,139
is why it's very sorry this is why it's

242
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,240
very important for us to understand and

243
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,500
control the molecular abnormalities in

244
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,480
GBM

245
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,778
as if we can figure out a way to take

246
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,700
away traffic track B's ability to a GBM

247
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:50,278
this could lead to more effective

248
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,940
treatments in our fight against GBM and

249
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:52,939
other cancers

250
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,720
so in our next batch of experiments we

251
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,639
wanted to select a control that can make

252
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,820
sure that our work was valid and the

253
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,500
control we selected was Anna 12. Anna 12

254
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,360
is a unique molecule because it's

255
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,220
selectively inhibits track B with

256
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,500
minimal impact on other Trek Family

257
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,778
receptors or rtks

258
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,940
it crosses the blood-brain barrier and

259
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,679
non-competitively antagonizers track B

260
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,160
receptors LinkedIn binding domain

261
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:23,099
preventing bdnf activation

262
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:26,039
a 2017 study demonstrated the

263
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,339
dose-dependent efficacy of Anna 12 on

264
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:32,539
u87 GBM cells assessing cell viability

265
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,540
over 72 hours

266
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:37,439
so our goal was to find out what happens

267
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,299
to these GBM cancer cells when we expose

268
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,680
them to more and more of these Trek B

269
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,199
inhibitors

270
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,479
so first we started with Ana 12 we

271
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,740
tested out on two different types of GBM

272
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,259
cells the ae-172s and u87s to make sure

273
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,299
we can get the same results as the 2017

274
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,299
study

275
00:10:54,299 --> 00:11:00,179
next we moved on to can Flavin a

276
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,740
and then we looked at can 5 and B

277
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,599
and when you look at the bar graphs of

278
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,579
the results you can see that as we

279
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,440
increase the dose and the amount of time

280
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,539
cells were exposed to these Inhibitors

281
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,040
the cells responded way more than when

282
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,039
we just used DMSO control

283
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,759
next we wanted to see if these results

284
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,920
were the result of toxic molecules no

285
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,100
one wants those so we conducted a

286
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:25,919
cytotal toxicity ldhsa and results

287
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,159
showed low percentages of LDH for cant 5

288
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,679
and a and b in both cell lines most most

289
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,980
doses exhibited five percent or less

290
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,899
except for high dose can Flavin B

291
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,120
and what this indicates is that the

292
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:43,039
decrease in cell viability is not due to

293
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,039
necrosis caused by the molecules

294
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,620
to assess how these compounds inhibit

295
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,199
cell migration we perform the 2D scratch

296
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,179
I say this is where we use a tip to

297
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,620
scratch a monolayer of cells on a plate

298
00:11:54,179 --> 00:12:00,179
and then live live time lapse Imaging

299
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,820
captures the migration of GBM cancer

300
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,399
cells with the addition of Ana 12 and

301
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,778
can flavins compared to DMSO

302
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,778
you can see how they're moving here

303
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,740
now interestingly what we found was that

304
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,480
the cells migrated faster with canned

305
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,000
flavins but then they slowed down after

306
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,839
48 Hours when you compare them to the

307
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,839
DMSO control

308
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,778
next We performed a 3D spheroid

309
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,939
migration assay and after 24 hours low

310
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:32,039
doses of the Inhibitors reduce the

311
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,740
number of area cells migrating from the

312
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:37,819
spheroid compared to the DMSO control

313
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,820
you can see that data here

314
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:45,600
we want to see how these substances Ana

315
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,600
12 candy can be can affect the way GBM

316
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,480
cells Invader spread and to do this we

317
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,399
use the Boyden chamber assay this is a

318
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,019
special setup where we put the cells on

319
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,539
a jaw that represent the environment

320
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,419
around the cells in the body and then we

321
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:02,219
give the cells about 24 hours to do

322
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,199
their work

323
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,180
after that we clean up and we add a

324
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,500
special a special diet of the cells and

325
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:08,879
we can see them better under the

326
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,799
microscope

327
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,799
and from our early results it looks like

328
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,500
even small amounts of Ana 12 canny and

329
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,719
can be can slow down these GBM cells

330
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,539
making them less able to spread through

331
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,160
the gel this is a good sign because it

332
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,259
suggests that these substances can

333
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,039
potentially slow down the spread of GBM

334
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,039
cells in the body

335
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,659
so in a nutshell our researchers first

336
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,458
found that can 5 and a and b are able to

337
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,620
put the brakes on activation of a

338
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:39,539
particular signal signaling pathway in

339
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,000
cells called track B

340
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:43,860
this pathway is often overly active in

341
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,679
many forms of cancers including those

342
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,300
found in the breast and the Brain

343
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,299
and Camp Robinsons have demonstrated

344
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:53,039
their power against these GBM cells by

345
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:55,259
being able to reduce the viability of

346
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,819
these cells and even better doing this

347
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:01,259
without being without any toxic effects

348
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,519
we discovered that these canned vitamins

349
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,980
can slow down the movement of these

350
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,379
cancer cells this was seen in both 2D

351
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,839
and 3D environments with the cells

352
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:12,059
moving slowly after 48 hours and 24

353
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,220
hours respectively when compared against

354
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:16,039
the control

355
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,778
foreign

356
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:20,519
we also found that even in small doses

357
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:22,620
Camp Islands were able to decrease the

358
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,200
invasion of these cancer cells after

359
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,820
just 24 hours this suggests that can

360
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,079
flattens have a strong potential in

361
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,300
slowing down the spread of certain

362
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,479
cancer types opening up a new

363
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:35,759
possibility of cancer treatment

364
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,680
so where do we go to from here

365
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,120
looking forward our team is eager to

366
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,399
continue this work and in the coming

367
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,519
months we'll start to use cerebral

368
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,919
organoid or mini brain co-cultures to

369
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:51,320
delve even deeper into the potential of

370
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,319
canned flavins to Halt cancer invasion

371
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,279
moreover we're preparing to utilize

372
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,500
assays that track the movement of cancer

373
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,578
cells that Express a green fluorescent

374
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,379
protein

375
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:02,939
and by pre-treating these cells with

376
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,759
camp flavins we aim to further

377
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,620
investigate the compounds at capacity to

378
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,620
put a stop to cancer metastasis

379
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,739
now it's important to note that this is

380
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,439
just one branch of our comprehensive

381
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,940
research programs right we have amassed

382
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,560
a significant amount of data that

383
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,779
underpin our ability to take our

384
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,059
laboratory findings and apply them in

385
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:26,399
living organisms in Vivo

386
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,679
for instance we have encouraging results

387
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,500
from a trial involving transgenic C

388
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,719
elegans this is a type of worm over

389
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,120
expressing a human Tau protein that

390
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,579
tends to aggregate a common feature in

391
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,278
many neurological diseases

392
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:43,679
now in this trial we used an extract of

393
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,559
can 5 and a and b mixed at a three to

394
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:49,138
one ratio and found that it had a modest

395
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:52,319
positive effect on their survival of

396
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:55,740
these transgenic C elegans

397
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,839
now most crucially in relation to what

398
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,519
I'm talking about today we found that

399
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,699
can flavins at a variety of different

400
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,980
doses do not cause neurotoxic effects to

401
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:07,198
the living worms and this is very

402
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,659
promising a discovery when considering

403
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,719
canned filings as diseases for the CNS

404
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:14,159
and the Brain

405
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,959
so I'd like to thank you all for coming

406
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,759
to my presentation I want to acknowledge

407
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,439
all the researchers who have done well

408
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,958
to perform this science and move us

409
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,420
forward including John holbring the

410
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,939
alarm lag the aptar lab our converted

411
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:29,338
team my tax and Circ and the University

412
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,839
of golfer funding this project we're

413
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,180
very excited about the work we're doing

414
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,199
up in Canada thank you all for allowing

415
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:36,198
me to present to you today

416
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,539
delicious

417
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,540
you that's very interesting work I'm

418
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,539
curious your perspective on these two

419
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:50,939
different entities GBM and Tau protein

420
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:53,360
Alzheimer's Dementia in which the trick

421
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,519
B pathway would be an important

422
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,740
reparative and preventative pathway in

423
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,539
Alzheimer's where you might not want to

424
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,399
suppress it how do you tease those two

425
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,480
apart and the role of canaflavins in

426
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,480
each of those conditions

427
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,339
you're asking how do we adapt the data

428
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:13,679
from well I'm just curious your thoughts

429
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:16,558
right inhibiting trick B could be useful

430
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,660
in GBM yep but it seems like in models

431
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,660
of Alzheimer's increased trick B

432
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,279
activity is beneficial understood

433
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,199
so we're going to have another

434
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,240
presentation a little bit later today

435
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,279
Hunter land at BRC will take you a

436
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,558
little bit more through the transgenic C

437
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,839
elegans study there we looked a little

438
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,240
bit more at Tau and in order for me to

439
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,038
not step on his toes I'll let him share

440
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,558
with you what we found about Tau and

441
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:42,839
Alzheimer's in regards to canned flavins

442
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,819
but also cannabinoids as well

443
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:48,839
what's most important I think from this

444
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:51,240
is that we know that glioblastoma

445
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,038
um to less than two years survival and

446
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,660
keep people and patients are looking for

447
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,240
anything that can help prolong the

448
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,820
survivability of these patients and

449
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,960
that's what we found in these models so

450
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,740
that's the thing that we were most

451
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,740
excited about here

452
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,660
oh

453
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,279
yeah that's um interesting so I'm

454
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,080
wondering are there are there other

455
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,000
Therapeutics that are being developed

456
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,639
that Target Turk B and I'm wondering

457
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,259
what's special about the flavins from

458
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,240
cannabis

459
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:24,240
uh these seem like some of the most

460
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,859
expensive flavins I could get right

461
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,660
well I don't know if you can actually

462
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,819
get them which is why we're excited

463
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,320
about the work that you're doing these

464
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:33,058
molecules are extremely rare in the

465
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:36,119
cannabis plant they're usually found in

466
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:37,798
under 0.014 so you're never going to get

467
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,899
these molecules from smoking our

468
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,058
medicinal cannabis this is where our

469
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,620
company specializes we have a variety of

470
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:45,599
different

471
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:47,339
um production processes to allow us to

472
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,558
capture them in clinical and Commercial

473
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:51,959
quantities so that we can now do this

474
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:54,178
work and like we originally said these

475
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,220
molecules were first discovered to have

476
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,559
extremely high anti-inflammatory

477
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,440
properties but a different mechanism of

478
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,298
action than most of our end seeds the

479
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,038
different mechanism of action presumably

480
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:07,139
allows them to be safer than most of our

481
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,940
end seeds and we also know that

482
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,980
systematic chronic inflammation is the

483
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,500
root cause of many disease everything

484
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,900
from cancers tumors neurodegenerative

485
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,519
diseases so on and so forth starts with

486
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,798
chronic inflammation

487
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,359
yeah

488
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,700
there are like millions and zillions of

489
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,038
in sort of anti-inflammatory or

490
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,740
reductive molecules so yeah I'm

491
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,879
interested in what specific or curious I

492
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,419
would love to follow up with you more

493
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,419
and hear more

494
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,038
excellent excellent talk loved it um now

495
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,419
what do you perceive the route of

496
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,220
administration will be obviously these

497
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,440
won't survive pyrolytics and it's going

498
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,058
to probably be either oral or injected I

499
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,620
mean what do you anticipate there for

500
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,139
Rod Administration

501
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,699
so there's a couple of interesting

502
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,200
research projects that are going on

503
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
right now that we're following very

504
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,740
closely to see what the best way of

505
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,620
delivering these

506
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,419
um to the site of action in GBM as I

507
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:03,779
mentioned earlier the FDA is recently

508
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:06,538
granted an IND to cathlonome and in this

509
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:09,359
in their IND they're using smart

510
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:11,038
radiotherapy biomaterials to deliver it

511
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,859
straight to the site of action alongside

512
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,599
chemotherapy and without so we'll learn

513
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,418
as the science continues to progress and

514
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:21,500
we'll also continue to explore our own

515
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,500
our own roots of administration

516
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,480
thank you very much
